Mr. President, I rise today in morning business to speak \nabout a matter of great importance, and that is our broken judicial \nnomination and confirmation process. As Senators, we have sworn to \nsupport and defend the Constitution, and on the issue of judicial \nnominations the Constitution is straightforward. It states that the \nPresident nominates judges and the Senate has the duty to give its \nadvice and consent on those nominations. For over 200 years, that is \nexactly how it worked, regardless of which party was in power.\n  Over the past 2 years, the Democrat minority has attempted to change \nthe rules and stand 200 years of Senate tradition on its head. The \nDemocrat minority now thinks that 41 Senators should be able to dictate \nto the President which judges he can nominate. The minority also thinks \nthat it should be able to prevent the rest of the Senate from \nfulfilling its constitutional duty of voting up or down on judicial \nnominees.\n  The Democrats' position is contrary to our Constitution, our Senate \ntraditions, and the will of the American people as expressed at the \nballot box this past November. It must stop.\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\n  The advice and consent provision in the Constitution has served us \nfor over 214 years up until the last Congress. That meant that the \nSenate should vote, and for over 200 years no nominee with majority \nsupport has been denied an up-or-down vote in this body, zero.\n  The Democrats have said that they have confirmed 98 percent of the \nPresident's nominees. The actual number is 89 percent. But even at \nthat, are we to say that we are only going to follow the Constitution \n89 percent of the time? Furthermore, this Senate's record on dealing \nwith the President's appellate court nominees is the worst for any \nPresident in modern history. This President's record of having his \nappellate court nominees voted on is 69 percent, which ranks him lowest \nof any President in modern history.\n  It would be one thing if these nominees did not have the votes for \nconfirmation, but they do. These nominees will have 54 or 55, 56, 57 \nvotes for confirmation. It is wrong to deny them what the Constitution \nsays they deserve and for us to ignore our constitutional \nresponsibility to see that they have an up-or-down vote in this body.\n  The Democrats have said that it is their prerogative to debate. Well, \nthat is great. Let us debate them on the floor of the Senate. But \nbefore they can be debated, a nomination has to be brought to the \nSenate floor for debate. We have a right to debate under the \nConstitution in the Senate.\n  They have also suggested that judges ought to have broad support; \nthat they ought to have more than the necessary 51 votes for the simple \nmajority that has traditionally been the case in the Senate. There is \nnothing in the Constitution about filibustering judges. There is \nnothing in the Constitution about requiring a super-majority to confirm \njudges. If the Founders had wanted judges to get a super-majority vote, \nthey would have put that in there. They did it for treaties, for \nconstitutional amendments, and for overriding a Presidential veto. \nClearly, that was not the case with judges. It was the Founders' \nintention that the Senate dispose of them with a simple majority vote.\n  The Democrats in the Chamber have said that what we are trying to \naccomplish is ``the nuclear option,'' suggesting that somehow this is a \nradical process that we are trying to implement. Well, simply, that is \nnot true. There is nothing nuclear about re-establishing the precedent \nthat has been the case, the practice, and the pattern in this Senate \nfor over 200 years.\n\n  What is nuclear is what is being discussed by the Democrats in this \nbody, and that is shutting the Senate down over the issue of judicial \nnominees, which means important legislation to this country, such as \npassing a highway bill that will create jobs and growth in this \neconomy, could get shut down, or an energy policy which is important in \nmy State of South Dakota. We have gas prices at record levels, we have \nfarmers going into the field, the tourism industry is starting its \nseason, so we need to do something to help become energy independent. I \nam very interested in the issue of renewable fuels. I want to see as \nbig a renewable fuels standard as we can get on the Energy bill, but we \nhave to get it on the floor to debate it first. We cannot have these \nattempts, these threats--and I hope they are just that: threats--\nbecause it would be tragic, it would be nuclear, if the other side \ndecided to shut this Senate down over the issue of judicial nominees.\n  The Democrats in this Chamber have tried to confuse the issue of \nlegislative and judicial filibusters, clearly trying to confuse the \npublic about what this means. Well, what we are talking about is simply \nthe narrow issue of judicial nominees. It is part of this Senate's \nconstitutional responsibility and duty, and we must take it very \nseriously. However, in the last Congress that became extremely \npoliticized.\n  What we are talking about again is simply the issue of judicial \nfilibusters. Incidentally, it was the Democrats who last voted on the \nfilibuster in the Senate to do away with it back in 1995. It was a 76-\nto-19 vote. It had to do with the whole issue, not just judicial but \nlegislative filibusters as well. Many of those Democrats who voted to \nend the filibuster still serve in this institution today.\n  The American people see this as an issue of fundamental fairness. \nThey understand that this body's constitutional obligation, \nresponsibility, and duty is to provide advice and consent, and that \nmeans an up-or-down vote in the Senate.\n  The Democrats in the Senate have said that this President's nominees \nare extreme. There are going to be a couple of them reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee today. Janice Rogers Brown received 76 percent of \nthe vote the last time she faced the voters in California, which is not \nexactly a bastion of conservatism. Her nomination in this Senate has \nbeen stalled out for 21 months. Priscilla Owen will also be reported \nout today. She received 84 percent of the vote the last time she faced \nthe voters in Texas. She has been waiting around for 4 years in the \nSenate to get an up-or-down vote on her nomination. She was endorsed by \nevery major newspaper in the State of Texas. These nominees are not \nextreme. What is extreme is denying these good nominees a vote, and it \nbetrays the role and responsibility the Founders gave the Senate.\n  So as we embark upon and engage in this debate that is forthcoming on \njudicial nominees, let us keep in sight and in focus the facts, and the \nrole and responsibility this institution has to perform its duty. And \nthat is to make sure that when good people put their names forward for \npublic service, they at least are afforded the opportunity that every \nnominee with majority support throughout this Nation's history has had, \nand that is the chance to be voted on in the Senate.\n  I fully support what the other side is saying about wanting to debate \nthese nominees. Let us do it. I am certainly willing and hopeful that \nwe will be able to engage in a spirited and vigorous debate. Let us \ndebate, but then let us vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Democratic leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4042-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4042-S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. I understand we are in a period for morning business. I \nwill use leader time.\n  Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my friend from South \nDakota, but his assertion of facts is simply without foundation. When \nthe Democrats took the majority in the Senate, I, along with others, \nsaid that this was not payback time; we were not going to treat the \nRepublicans the way they treated us during the Clinton years. During \nthose years, they did not have the decency even to have hearings for \njudicial nominations; they simply left them, 60 in number, in the \ncommittee. We thought that was inappropriate, and that is the reason \nduring the time that President Bush has been President--we were in the \nmajority, and we are now in the minority--we have approved 205 judges \nfor President Bush and turned down 10, which is a pretty good record.\n  For people to say there have not been judicial filibusters in the \npast is simply without historical foundation. In the early days of this \nRepublic, there was no way to stop a filibuster. The only way one could \nstop a filibuster on judges or anything else was by virtue of agreeing \nto stop talking. Many judges were simply left by the wayside. They were \ntalked out and they simply never came forward for a vote before the \nSenate.\n\n  The most noteworthy filibuster of a judge that would require a vote \nthat failed was in 1881. There was a filibuster of a judge that went to \na vote. Prior to that time, they never even went to a vote.\n  It was determined in the Senate in 1970 that it would be appropriate \nto figure out some way to break a filibuster--on judges, on Cabinet \nnominations, and on legislation. At that time the Senate changed its \nrules by a two-thirds vote and had filibusters broken, then, by 67 \nvotes. In the 1960s it was determined that was a burden that was no \nlonger necessary, and it was changed to 60 votes. From that time to \ntoday, there has been the ability to break a filibuster by 60 Senators \nvoting.\n  There have been filibusters since that rule was changed in 1960, \nfilibusters of judges. The most noteworthy, of course, was Abe Fortas. \nThere was a filibuster, and there are wonderful statements in the \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\nRecord by Howard Baker at that time, who extolled the virtues of the \nfilibuster.\n  During the time I have been in the Senate there have been filibusters \nof judges. I can name two that come to my mind: Berzon and Paez. We had \na vote to break those here, on the filibuster. The majority leader \nvoted against breaking those filibusters. So we have had votes on many \noccasions dealing with filibusters of judges. This is no new thing.\n  What we have to keep in mind is that we, the legislative branch of \nGovernment, are separate but equal. That is what checks and balances \nare all about. The President should not have, from the Senate, a \nrubberstamp for everything he wants. We have the advise and consent \nclause in the Constitution and we have the obligation to look at these \njudges. We have approved 205 and turned down 10. For people to suggest \nthat you can break the rules to change the rules is un-American.\n  The only way you can change the rule in this body is through a rule \nthat now says, to change a rule in the Senate rules to break a \nfilibuster still requires 67 votes. You can't do it with 60. You \ncertainly cannot do it with 51. But now we are told the majority is \ngoing to do the so-called nuclear option. We will come in here, having \nthe Vice President seated where my friend and colleague from Nevada is \nseated. The Parliamentarian would acknowledge it is illegal, it is \nwrong, you can't do it, and they would overrule it. It would simply be: \nWe are going to do it because we have more votes than you.\n  You would be breaking the rules to change the rules. That is very un-\nAmerican. I ask my friends to look at what is going on in the press. In \nthe Post today, David Broder, a nationwide columnist, talks about how \nbad it would be. Dick Morris, who certainly is no lapdog for the \nDemocrats, has stated very clearly it would be the wrong thing to do. \nThe political damage would be done to Republicans for many years to \ncome.\n  This is something we should work out. This is something that should \nnot cause the disruption and dysfunction of our family, the Senate \nfamily. If this is done, the Senator from South Dakota is absolutely \nright; we will be working off the Democrats' agenda. We will let things \ngo forward. Of course, we will let things go forward to take care of \nthe troops and let us make sure the Government is funded. We are not \ngoing to do the Gingrich plan.\n  But things around here work by unanimous consent. Maybe the majority \nwants an excuse not to complete business because most of their business \nis a little faulty anyway. But we have worked very hard and showed our \ngood faith in the first quarter of this Congress. We have passed, for \nexample, the class action bill; we passed the bankruptcy bill--both of \nwhich were 15 years in the making. These are bills the majority of the \nSenators on this side of the aisle opposed. But I thought it was \nappropriate that we do business the way we should be doing business: \nhave people speak, debate the issue, and take your wins and losses as \nthey come. We had a couple of losses. But the fact is, we believe the \nbusiness of the Senate should be conducted in this manner.\n  I do not know what is going to happen in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee as it relates to Bolton, but the fact is, that is how things \nshould be decided. They should debate publicly and openly and then make \na decision as to whether he is good or bad for the United Nations. They \nare going to have some more hearings in that regard. I think that is \nappropriate. But to think that just because you do not get your way \nthat you are going to change the rules is wrong.\n  I have said once or twice on the Senate floor, when I was a little \nboy I took a big trip. My brother was 10 or 12 years older than I. He \nwas working for Standard Stations in a place in Arizona. It was a \nlittle town. It seemed like a big town coming from Searchlight. It took \nquite a few hours to drive over there. I spent a week with my brother. \nI thought it was going to be a week, but he had a girlfriend and I \ndidn't spend much time with him at all. I spent time with his \ngirlfriend's brother. I could beat her brother in anything--all card \ngames, board games, running, jumping, throwing. But I could never win \nbecause he kept changing the rules in the middle of the game. That is \nwhat is happening in the Senate. The majority can't get what they want \nso they break the rules to change the rules.\n\n  We believe the traditions of the Senate should be maintained. We \nbelieve if you are going to change the rules in the Senate, change them \nlegally, not illegally.\n  I hope my friends, people of goodwill on the other side of the aisle, \nwill take a very close look at this and see if it is the right thing to \ndo. I think we do have people of goodwill on the other side of the \naisle who understand the importance of maintaining the integrity of \nthis body.\n  As Senator Dole said when asked on Public Radio last week what he \nthought about the so-called nuclear option, He said: Watch it because \nwe are not going to be in the majority all the time. It will come \nback--these are my words, not his but the same meaning--it will come \nback to haunt us because the majority changes all the time.\n  I think it would be wrong for the Democrats to be able to do what the \nRepublicans are talking about doing. I think it would be wrong for the \nRepublicans to do what they are talking about doing. That is why we, \nSenator Frist and I, working with our caucus, have to try to tamp down \nthe emotions on this issue and do what we can to bring the Senate \nfamily together and do things the right way so we can continue to do \nlegislation.\n  I spoke to the distinguished majority leader a few minutes ago. We \nwant to do the highway bill. We have the Energy bill. Senator Domenici \nand Senator Bingaman are working hand in hand, more than they have in \nmany years. They are going to come up with the Energy bill. The \nSenators are going to bring it to the floor and we will debate it.\n  As the President was told several days ago by Senator Baucus when \nthey were called to the White House, Senator Baucus said: You do the \nnuclear option, there will be no Energy bill. That is the way things \nare and that is wrong.\n  (Ms. MURKOWSKI assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I hope we will be able to work our way \nthrough this issue and come up with something appropriate and move on. \nWe have a number of judges who are pending now. They should not have to \nwait around.\n  In the situation we now have there is no question the committees are \nworking so well together. Senator Specter and Senator Leahy are working \nwell together. I do not like the asbestos bill. I am not sure there is \nanything that can be done to make me happy about the asbestos bill \nbecause I have such strong feelings about the people who died of \nmesothelioma and asbestosis. But one of the things I did when I became \nleader, I told my ranking members that they were their committees. They \ncould do whatever was appropriate in the confines of that committee.\n  Senator Leahy did what he thought was appropriate. I may disagree \nwith that asbestos bill, but he had every right to work with Senator \nSpecter and come up with a bill. That bill is here at the desk right \nnow. That is the way things should work.\n  Senators Specter and Leahy have gotten so much done during the first \nfew months they have been working together. There is a lot more we can \ndo. That Judiciary Committee has some of the most interesting but \ncontroversial issues that we have. When you have two people working \ntogether as closely as Leahy and Specter have been, we can expect some \nthings on the floor of the Senate that will be interesting and \ncontroversial, but that is our job.\n  I repeat for the third time, I hope we can move forward and get the \nwork of the American people done. That is what this is all about. We do \nnot come here to please any particular constituency. We come here to \nplease the people of our States and the people of this country. That is \nour job.\n  We need to recognize we have equal power to the judicial and \nexecutive branches of Government. A number of years ago, when President \nKennedy was President, there was a chairman of the Rules Committee in \nthe House by the name of Smith. He was a Democrat. President Kennedy \nwas a Democrat. He called Mr. Smith because he\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nwanted an appropriate ruling from the Rules Committee of which Mr. \nSmith was the chairman. And Smith wouldn't even return the President's \ncall. He knew he did not have to. He stood for the legislative branch \nof Government. He didn't have to take orders or suggestions or even \ntalk to the President.\n  He may have carried things a little too far, but that shows the \nstrength of the legislative branch. We are as powerful as the judicial \nbranch of Government and the executive branch of Government. When we \ncome to the realization that we are not, it is not good for this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I respect the Senator and I appreciate \nwhat he has to say about wanting to move the agenda. That is something \nI am very concerned about because of the Highway Bill, as well as the \nEnergy Bill. Those are things that are lined up and need to be done. \nThey are unfinished business from the last Congress. My concern from \nall this, and the Senator from Nevada has been here long enough, \nobviously, to know this, the Senate does set its rules and procedures. \nThat is part of the Constitution. Back in 1980, of course, the Senate \ndid the same things we are talking about doing here when the Democrats \nhad control under Senator Byrd.\n  But more important, this needs to be based on facts. The facts are on \nour side in this debate. If you look back--the Senator from Nevada \ntalked about historical precedents. The reality is what I said earlier \nis absolutely accurate, and that is there has not been a judicial \nnominee with majority support in the history of this Nation, up until \nthe last Congress, who was denied an up-or-down vote in the Senate by a \nfilibuster or by using the Standing Rules of the Senate to prevent that \nfrom happening. That simply is a fact.\n  It is also a fact that in the instance he referred to back in 1968, \nthe Fortas nomination to the High Court, it was President Johnson's \nselection for Chief Justice. That was, I should say, a bipartisan \nattempt. It was a judge who did not have majority support in the \nSenate, and furthermore it was a judge about whom they were raising \nethical issues.\n  The nominees we are referring to here are people of high quality. \nThey are people who have been rated by the American Bar Association as \nbeing highly qualified to serve on the bench. They are not extreme, as \nthe Democrats have suggested. They are judges who have been voted on in \ntheir States and won overwhelming majorities. These are people who \ndeserve to be voted on in the Senate. This is about the tradition, it \nis about the precedent, it is about the history of the Senate, and it \nis about the Constitution. And it is about the responsibility, as \nSenators, that we have to see that these judicial nominees who are \npresented by the President for confirmation, for the Senate to perform \nits advise and consent role, are dealt with in an appropriate way.\n  I hope the Senator from Nevada will work with our leadership to try \nto fashion a way in which these judges can be voted on in the Senate. \nIf they are not, we are setting an entirely new precedent for the \nfuture of how these judicial nominees are going to be considered in the \nSenate because this is unprecedented in the history of this Nation, \nwhat has happened in the last session of Congress, and what is being \nsuggested by the Democrats in the Senate at this time. And that is that \nthey will shut this institution down and keep other legislation from \nmoving forward simply because they want to dictate to the majority and \nto the President of the United States about the kind of judges he ought \nto be submitting to the Senate for confirmation.\n  I have a couple of other colleagues here who want to speak to this \nissue, but it is important that this debate be about the facts. I hope \nwe can have an opportunity to debate these judges. Then I hope we have \nthe opportunity to vote on them.\n  I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I, too, rise this morning to speak about \nan issue of great importance to me as a freshman of this body; more \nimportant, to the Senate as an institution; and most important, to \nAmerica as a Nation: that is, what is clearly our horribly broken and \npartisan judicial confirmation process.\n  Two years ago, the Members of the Senate freshman class of the 108th \nCongress called on all of their Senate colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to take a careful look at the Senate's process of \nconfirming judicial nominees. They were fresh from the campaign trail \nin their respective States, fresh from talking to citizens every day in \ntheir campaigns. They heard over and over how dissatisfied people were \nwith the partisanship, the bitter partisanship and obstructionism that \nthey found in Washington, particularly in the Senate. They heard over \nand over that the clearest example of that was the horribly broken, \nbitterly partisan judicial confirmation process.\n  Unfortunately, their valiant efforts did not succeed in fundamentally \nchanging and improving the process. Because of that, as I was on the \ncampaign trail to run for the Senate last year, I heard those same \nthemes, those same concerns from voters all across Louisiana. I know my \nother freshman colleagues heard the same things from voters in their \nStates. They heard over and over how tired and upset people were at the \nbitter partisanship in Washington, particularly in the Senate; the \nendless obstructionism, the endless filibusters. Again, the clearest \nexample of that in citizens' minds was the horribly broken, bitterly \npartisan judicial confirmation process.\n\n  I heard over and over in every part of the State, folks from all \nwalks of life, folks from both parties: Do the people's business. Get \nbeyond all of that game playing. Get beyond that bitter partisanship. \nThe obstructionism, the filibusters, that is not doing the people's \nbusiness.\n  Yesterday, I joined with many other Members of my freshman class, the \ncurrent Senate freshman class, in again calling for the Senate \nleadership to work together to address the judicial crisis--I use that \nword for good reason--the judicial crisis we are facing.\n  As we stated in our freshman letter to our colleagues from Tennessee \nand Nevada, progress often requires us to make difficult but fairminded \ndecisions. The time has come to prepare our damaged, broken judicial \nconfirmation process. We need a genuine commitment to upholding the \nequitable principles of our judicial system, a sense of respect for our \ndeeply rooted traditions, and the willingness to compromise.\n  Several judicial vacancies have been lingering not for months but for \nyears, as my colleague from South Dakota has said, causing more than \none jurisdiction to formally declare a ``judicial emergency.'' Because \nof long-term vacancies, it is imperative we, as Senators, respond \npromptly to these emergencies. It is unacceptable we should have \njudicial vacancies in our courts for up to 6 or more years in some \ncases. It is time to put aside the grievances, the obstructionism, the \npartisanship that has been built up.\n  A recent case in point is the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Judge Brown, whose \nnomination has been pending since July 2003, as my colleague from South \nDakota noted, is a highly qualified judicial candidate, as evidenced by \nher background and her training. Justice Brown has 8 years of \nexperience on the California appellate bench, and she has dedicated all \nbut 2 years of her 26-year legal career to public service. Right now, \nshe serves as associate judge of the California Supreme Court, a \nposition she has held since May 1997.\n  Justice Brown is the first African-American to serve on that State's \nhighest court and was retained with 76 percent of the vote in her last \nelection. California is not exactly a rightwing State. In 2002, Justice \nBrown's colleagues relied on her to write the majority opinion for the \nCalifornia Supreme Court more times than any other justice.\n  The daughter of sharecroppers, Justice Brown was born in Greenville, \nAL, in 1949. She came of age in the South, tragically in the midst of \nJim Crow policies, having attended segregated schools in her youth. She \ngrew up listening to her grandmother's stories about the NAACP lawyer \nwho defended Martin Luther King, Jr., and Rosa Parks. Her experiences \nas a child and\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\nthose stories from her grandmother moved her to become a lawyer. In her \nteens, she moved to California with her family. She earned a B.A. in \neconomics from California State in 1974. She earned her law degree from \nUCLA Law School in 1977.\n  In 2003, a bipartisan group of 12 of Justice Brown's current and \nformer judicial colleagues wrote then-Judiciary Committee Chairman \nOrrin Hatch in support of her nomination--again, a fully bipartisan \ngroup. Another fully bipartisan group of 15 California law professors \ndid the same, as did a dean of the appellate bar in California, and the \nCalifornia director of Minorities in Law Enforcement. What those who \nknow her best say is Justice Brown is a superb judge, conscientious, \nhardworking, intelligent, sensible, openminded.\n  Yet Justice Brown, like multiple other judicial nominees, has been \nwaiting and waiting and waiting for an up-or-down vote in the Senate. \nIt is unfair to her. More importantly, it is unfair to the citizens of \nthis country.\n  Some, like the distinguished minority leader, argue that this is some \nlongstanding venerable practice. That is simply not true. A few minutes \nago, the minority leader said in the early days of the Republic, \nfilibusters were common. I hope, in the midst of this very important \ndebate, he will read the history carefully because in the early days of \nthe Republic, the Senate rules had no such thing as a filibuster. The \nSenate rules were pure majority rule because there was a motion that no \nlonger exists to call the question, to end debate by a majority vote. \nSo in the early days of the Republic--and this is crystal clear in \nhistory--there was no opportunity for filibuster because the Senate, \njust like the House, then and now, operated by pure majority vote.\n  Certainly it is clear this practice of judicial filibusters for \nappellate court nominees is brand new. It has never, ever happened for \na nominee with majority support before the last Congress. They are very \nclear, very well-known examples that prove the point. What about Robert \nBork and Clarence Thomas--very controversial nominations opposed by \nmany on the Democratic side but neither was filibustered. Both got up-\nor-down votes in the relatively recent past. One was confirmed. One was \nnot. That is how the process is supposed to work. That is how it did \nwork until the last Congress.\n\n  Others say, yes, these floor filibusters are new but nominees have \nbeen held up in the committee before. That has been the functional \nequivalent of these filibusters we now see when the majority party in \nthe past held up certain nominees in committee.\n  My response is very simple and very direct. We should change the \ncommittee rules as part of this process to ensure every appellate court \nnominee, every Supreme Court nominee gets to the Senate floor for an \nup-or-down vote within a certain amount of time. That will fully \nrespond to any legitimate concerns in that regard. That will fully \nrespond to any of those grievances from the past. They can come to the \nSenate, within a certain amount of time, under a mandate which we can \nput in the committee or the full Senate rules, and the committee can \nsend them to the Senate with a recommendation we confirm that judge, or \nthat confirmation can come to the Senate with a negative report by a \nmajority of the committee.\n  We face an impasse. We must do whatever is necessary to end it. \nInaction is no longer accessible. Now is the time to resolve it.\n  Like the complicated policy issues we tackle every day, we cannot \navoid the judicial crisis and its surrounding confirmation issues \nwithout expecting our inaction to have a major impact on our country. \nThe integrity of our entire judicial system is at stake. Indeed, the \nintegrity of the Federal Government and Congress is at stake as \ncitizens again and again say: Put the people's business first. Take up \nthe people's business. Get beyond this horrible partisanship, \nobstructionism, and these filibusters.\n  In closing, I encourage all of my colleagues to take a careful look \nat the Senate confirmation process. I ask we work together to refine \nour judicial confirmation process and to break down those partisan \nwalls that have stood in the way of advancing judicial nominations.\n  There is one compelling reason we need to do this. That is doing the \npeople's business. That is serving the people--not partisan political \ninterests--and the people, across the Nation, all of our citizens, are \ndemanding it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I was one of those new Members of the \nSenate elected in the class of 2002 my friend and colleague from \nLouisiana talked about. We did lament the partisan divide that \ncertainly has been growing in this body for a while but has been \nclearly reflected in the battle over judicial appointments.\n  The President has the constitutional authority to appoint judges. \nThat is very clear. It is an authority that has never, in the history \nof this country, up until last year, when my colleague across the aisle \ndecided to filibuster those appointees, it has never in the history of \nthis country required anything more than a majority vote. We are \ntalking about judicial appointments.\n  The President must appoint folks who are qualified. There are \nstandards by which one can review that. The American Bar Association is \ninvolved in that process and they, in fact, grade nominees. In the case \nof the President's appointees, each of those nominees received the \nendorsement--in effect, the label, the standard--of ``qualified'' or \n``highly qualified.'' They met the basic test that has to be met.\n  What has happened in the last year is now a new political test put in \nplace, a political test that has then required a new standard, an \nunprecedented standard in the history of this country. I repeat, in the \nhistory of this country, nominees who could get a majority vote have \nnot been filibustered until last year.\n  The other side has said: We have confirmed so many judges, hundreds \nof judges, but when it comes to appellate court judges, the level below \nthe Supreme Court, last year I believe it was 30 percent of those were \nfilibustered, were stopped, and a higher percentage then face that this \nyear. Our obligation in the Constitution is to advise and consent. It \nis not to advise and construct. Nominees deserve simply an up-or-down \nvote. That has been the process that has served this country so well \nfor nearly 250 years.\n  I support the right of filibuster. I love that movie ``Mr. Smith Goes \nto Washington.'' I thought Jimmy Stewart was fabulous. I watched that \nas a kid, and I thought being on the floor of the Senate, standing and \nnot stepping down, fighting for what you believe, is part of the \nhistory of the Senate.\n  It is not, by the way, the history of the United States for its \nentire existence. It was not the history of the United States, contrary \nto the words of the distinguished and learned minority leader from \nNevada, it is not the history when this country began. But it has been \npart of our history. I recognize that.\n  By the way, it has not always been as glorious as when Jimmy Stewart \nwas in that movie, standing on the floor of the Senate. The history of \nthe filibuster, which now is being paraded as this icon of protection \nof rights, this history, unfortunately, has a history of being used to \nblock anti-lynching legislation. It was used to block civil rights \nlegislation. That has been the history of the filibuster. But I respect \nthat history. I respect that tradition of filibustering legislation \neven if I disagree with it.\n  But never before has there been a tradition of using that filibuster, \nthat tool, to block judicial nominees. That is what is different today.\n  I do believe the last effort to limit the filibuster occurred when \nRepublicans took control of the Senate about 1994 and 1995; there were \nefforts to limit the filibuster. There were 19 votes for that effort. \nEvery one of them were Democrats. Every one of them were my colleagues \nacross the aisle, some of whom still serve in this institution \ntoday. That has been the history of limiting the filibuster. But the \nhistory is clear that, up until last year, the filibuster has not been \nused to block a nominee who has majority support.\n\n  I am also deeply concerned about what we are doing to civics with \nthis discussion. I think we are confusing young people. When I grew up \nand studied civics, I understood what checks\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\nand balances were. I am watching commercials today that talk about the \neffort of the Democrats to block judicial appointees is somehow \napplying the concept of checks and balances. I have to gather my 15-\nyear-old daughter Sarah and tell her that is not what checks and \nbalances are about. The concept of checks and balances has to do with \nthe wisdom of our Founders to balance the power of the executive branch \nagainst the power of the legislative branch and the power of the \njudicial branch. That is checks and balances--a magnificent concept.\n  But checks and balances does not mean, and has never meant, that \nsomehow the minority can block the majority from governing in an \nExecutive Calendar, where the President has the authority to appoint \nindividuals who he thinks are qualified, and then we measure that \nqualification--not politics, not their views on certain political \nissues, but their competence, their integrity, their capacity to do the \njob--and we then advise and consent, we give the up-or-down vote.\n  But checks and balances have nothing to do with the attempt of the \nminority, right here, to block the majority from simply confirming \nPresidential appointees. We are not talking about changing the \nlegislative calendar. We are not talking about interfering with the \nright to filibuster on legislative issues. We are talking about \nupholding the Constitution.\n  It is interesting, if you go back--and like the Presiding Officer, I \nhave been here only a few years--we have learned from some of our \ncolleagues about the history of what went on before. In the past, the \nSenate did not filibuster judicial nominees. There were times when you \nhad very liberal judges coming up for confirmation by Democratic \nPresidents, and you had Republicans controlling the process, and you \nhad majority leaders such as Trent Lott supporting cloture for liberal \nnominees who, on the basis of ideology, they would not support.\n  Judge Paez, in the Ninth Circuit, I believe was one of the judges \ninvolved in the decision that you cannot say ``one Nation under God.'' \nI know many of my colleagues felt Judge Paez's views were extreme. But \nthey respected the power of the President to make an appointee, and \nthey respected the history and tradition of this institution that says: \nGive nominees an up-or-down vote. Paez got that up or down vote and was \nconfirmed.\n  So my deep concern is somehow we are involved in almost this \nOrwellian doublespeak today that we are talking about checks and \nbalances in a process that has no relationship to what checks and \nbalances have always meant. Again, our young people should understand \nthat.\n  We have bent over backward to protect minority views in this Senate. \nWhen it comes to appointments, the majority has a right and a \nresponsibility to act. Then all of us have the right to vote yes or no. \nLet's do the right thing. Let's uphold the tradition of this \ninstitution. Give people the right to get an up-or-down vote when they \nare nominated for a judicial office.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4046-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I come to this Chamber this morning to \nmake a few comments in response to my colleagues from Minnesota, South \nDakota, and Louisiana, concerning the judicial nomination process.\n  Let me say at the outset, I believe the work of this body and this \nCongress should be getting about the people's business. I believe this \nissue concerning the filibuster rule is something that is distracting \nthis country and this Congress from doing what we should be working on.\n  In the Washington Post this morning, the headline story talks about \nthe economic worries of America. The first two paragraphs of the \narticle in the Washington Post read as follows:\n\n       Inflation and interest rates are rising, stock values have \n     plunged, a tank of gas induces sticker shock, and for nearly \n     a year, wages have failed to keep up with the cost of living.\n       Yet in Washington, the political class has been consumed \n     with the death of a brain-damaged woman in Florida, the \n     ethics of the House majority leader, and the fate of the \n     Senate filibuster.\n\n  I would submit that we as a body have a responsibility to address the \nissues the people of this country care about. Those issues are about \npassing a transportation bill for America. Those issues are about \ngetting an energy bill passed for the people of America that helps us \nget rid of our overdependence on foreign oil. Those issues are about \nmaking sure we address the most crippling issue affecting America \ntoday--and that is business and people alike-- the issue of health \ncare, which is bankrupting this country and many families throughout \nour States.\n\n  We get into this discussion here about what is happening with respect \nto judges. The fact is, what the majority is attempting to do is to \nsimply break the rules. They are simply attempting to break the rules \nbecause they have the power.\n  Now, I live in an America that strongly supports the fact we have a \npower that was created by our Founding Fathers, distributed between the \nexecutive, with checks and balances, and the Congress, and different \nrules for the Senate. Part of that is assuring a guarantee when we make \ndecisions for the American people, especially with respect to judges \nwho have lifetime appointments, that we are appointing the very best \npeople to those positions. The debate that is underway today concerning \nthe so-called filibuster rule, from my point of view, is an effort to \ntry to change the rules in midstream. It also is reflective of the \nabuse of power we see in Washington today. To be sure, when you look at \nthe history of what has happened with judicial appointments in the last \ndecade and a half or so, there have been 60 Democratic nominees from \nPresident Clinton who were rejected by this Senate. On the other hand, \nif you look at what has happened with President Bush's nominees, we \nhave had over 96 percent of all of his appointees confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Now, under anybody's scorecard, if you get a 96-percent success rate, \nI think you have done pretty well. You can ask my daughters, who are \nstellar students in their school; getting a 96-percent grade is pretty \ngood. That is a much higher rating for President Bush's appointees than \nwe had for prior Presidents.\n  So I would say this is not about these particular nominees. I have \nnot yet taken my own position with respect to what I will do with these \nseven nominees. I will study their records, and I will make my decision \nbased on those records. But, at the end of the day, this is whether we \nwill uphold the cherished traditions of this Senate that have provided \nthe kinds of checks and balances that have been important for this \nSenate to be able to function.\n  In my view, those rules force us, as Republicans and Democrats, to \ncome together to work through the issues that are most important for \nour country. I believe the way this issue has been presented to this \nbody and to the American people has been destructive not only to this \nbody but also destructive to the real agenda on which we as the elected \nrepresentatives of the people should be working.\n  That real agenda is about roads. It is about transportation. It is \nabout energy. It is about health care. It is about the issues that \naffect every person every day. They are the kinds of issues that affect \npeople when they get out of bed in the morning and wonder what is going \nto happen to their families, their children, and their parents. Those \nare the kinds of issues we should be working on as opposed to working \non these kinds of very divisive issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4046-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4046-S4047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AFGHAN SECURITY FORCES STANDARDS AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I would 1ike to speak a little bit \nabout amendment No. 454, which was adopted unanimously by the Senate \nlast night. I appreciate and thank Senators Cochran and Byrd for the \ntime they have spent working with me on this amendment. I also note and \nappreciate the work of Senators McConnell and Leahy on this matter. \nTheir staff members, Paul Grove and Tim Rieser, were very helpful.\n  It is clear that success in Iraq and Afghanistan is dependent on how \nwell\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\nand how fast we train security forces and police there. It is also \nclear that the faster and better we train these forces, the sooner our \ntroops can come home.\n  This amendment is designed to ensure that the training in \nAfghanistan--for which this bill dedicates more than $600 million, \nincluding $44.5 million which is to be available only for the \nestablishment of a pilot program to train local Afghan police forces--\nis handled well and is handled in an accountable fashion.\n  We have seen what happens when training is rushed or when \naccountability is ignored. The Haitian National Police, for which we \nspent hundreds of millions of dollars training in the 1990s, is all but \ndisbanded. We are all familiar with the stories of mismanagement of \npolice training in the Balkans. And just last week, Secretary Rumsfeld \ntook an emergency trip to Baghdad to try to salvage some of the \ntraining we have done there as Shiite political leaders threaten to \npurge Sunni officials from the forces.\n  This amendment is meant to ensure that training in Afghanistan \nbenefits from lessons learned and the mistakes of the past. It adds \ncommonsense provisions to the $660 million appropriated for police and \ncounternarcotics programs in Afghanistan. We need to take this step \nbecause the challenges we face in training a capable security and \npolice force in Afghanistan are perhaps even more daunting than in \nIraq.\n  First, Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of poppy, the raw \nmaterial for heroine. It produces 80 percent of the world's heroine \nand, according to the United Nations, is currently producing \ndramatically more than it did under the control of the Taliban. Keep in \nmind that heroine use not only fuels crime throughout Europe and in the \nUnited States, but it funds terrorist organizations and is responsible \nfor the looming AIDS crisis throughout eastern Europe.\n  Second, there are already several countries and organizations \ntraining forces in Afghanistan, including for the vitally important \neffort of counternarcotics. In fact, this difficult task of building a \ncapable law enforcement system in that formerly ruler-less country is \ndivided among the United States, Italy, Great Britain and several \ndifferent international organizations.\n  And third, the way the administration has structured this program \nlends itself to confusion and competition among American agencies. The \nfunding in the bill goes to the Department of Defense, but much of the \npolice training will be handled by the State Department.\n  This amendment is an effort to make sure we can get the \naccountability our taxpayers deserve as well as the success that our \nnational security demands.\n  I recognize good training will not be easy. I also understand that in \npost-conflict societies, it is often difficult to find good personnel. \nBut I also recognize that we simply have to get better at how we train \nother people to take over security in their own countries.\n  The stress on our Armed Forces demands no less. The challenges facing \nU.S. taxpayers demand no less. And success in post-conflict societies \ndemands no less.\n  Before coming to the U.S. Senate, I had the honor of serving our \ngreat State of Colorado as attorney general. In that job, I made \nhomeland security my highest priority.\n  One of the responsibilities I had as attorney general was being \nchairman of the Peace Officers Standards and Training Board, POST. \nGiven all that our police officers and their families give for us and \nfor our State, the least I could do was to fight for additional \ntraining and support resources.\n  In 2003, we did that, and in exchange we asked for greater \naccountability. We did that, too, and the result has been a better \ntrained and more accountable police force, not to mention a safer \nColorado.\n  It has worked in Colorado and across this country. I believe with the \nadoption of this amendment we can start to make it happen in our police \ntraining overseas as well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I pray for him \nas he assumes this awesome responsibility for our church and for our \nworld.\n  I have also been comforted by the comments we have heard from Pope \nBenedict XVI. We know we face some difficult challenges in the Catholic \nChurch in the days and years ahead. We also know we as Catholics are \nnot united on every issue. As I said on this floor after the passing of \nPope John Paul the Great, we as Catholics are both comforted by our \nchurch's teachings and challenged by its demands. That will continue to \nbe the case. And that is as it should be.\n  What is also true is what Pope Benedict XVI said yesterday. He said: \nCatholics ``look serenely at the past and do not fear the future.''\n  I was also touched by another thing the Pope said yesterday. In \nrelation to John Paul the Great's efforts to reach out to other \nChristian faiths, Pope Benedict XVI said:\n\n       I am fully determined to accept every initiative that seems \n     opportune to promote contact and understanding.\n\n  ``I am fully determined to accept every initiative that seems \nopportune to promote contact and understanding.''\n  I am praying for those kinds of efforts. I hope each of us will take \na moment this Sunday, the very day of the Pope's inaugural mass, to \npause and reflect on how we can best live up to this challenge from \nPope Benedict XVI.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as a Senator who has served in both the \nHouse of Representatives and the Senate, in both the majority and the \nminority in the House and both in the majority and the minority in the \nSenate, I am distressed at some of the rhetoric and debate that has \ngone forward relative to the role of the so-called filibuster rule or \nthe nuclear option, as some people refer to it. It is my hope the \ndebate can go forward in a more civil and thoughtful manner than has \nsometimes been the case up until now.\n  I have served--and it has been an honor to serve--in both bodies. \nEach of the bodies, the House and the Senate, has a respective and \nimportant role to play. One of the factors, however, that most \ndistinguishes the Senate from the other body is the existence of the \n60-vote rule, the so-called filibuster rule, which has the consequence \nof requiring both political parties to come to the center, to have some \nat least modicum of bipartisanship in the proposals they pursue, the \nnominees who are considered.\n  That is one of the great strengths of the Senate. I know it \nfrustrates some who would like to see the Senate operate more as the \nother body does, where a one-vote margin is all that is essentially \never necessary. A rules committee further streamlines things. As a \nconsequence, the other body tends to be and has been over the years \nmost often a far more partisan body than the Senate.\n  The Founders designed the Senate with 6-year terms and a differing \nbasis for selection as a body that would be the more thoughtful, more \ndeliberative, would take the longer view of initiatives that are before \nthe Congress. The Senate plays a very important role.\n  There is too much partisanship in Congress. I have the honor of \nrepresenting South Dakota, a State some would describe as a dark red \nState that President Bush won by a large margin this last time. I am \nvery proud of the\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\nRepublican support that has been extended to me over the years I have \nhad the honor of serving in the House and the Senate. The people of \nSouth Dakota are tired and grow weary of the intensity of the \npartisanship that too often exists in Washington, DC. The people of \nSouth Dakota want to see both sides brought together to govern as \nAmericans rather than as Republicans or Democrats. That is not asking \ntoo much, for the traditions and the historic rules that have existed \nin this body that encourage bipartisanship should remain.\n  This notion that somehow in the midst of Congress rules that have \nbeen in place for generations should be eliminated and the bipartisan \nmandate they allow for should be eliminated is a step in the wrong \ndirection.\n  One of the consequences of the 60-vote rule is it takes both parties \nby the scruff of the neck, brings them together and says: You will have \nto reach across the aisle and cooperate, coordinate with your \ncolleagues from the other political party, whether or not you like it. \nThat has been a very valuable asset to the Senate and, again, one of \nthe things that distinguishes the debate and deliberation and progress \nof legislation in the Senate from what transpires with our colleagues \nin the other body.\n  There is too much division in America today. There is too much \npartisanship. The rhetoric has grown far too bitter. It has grown far \ntoo extreme. What America wants, and what I believe my constituents \nwant, is more governing from the center. Most South Dakotans and most \nAmericans recognize neither party has all the answers, neither party \nhas all the good or bad ideas, and we are governing best when we come \ntogether in the political center. That will leave the far left and the \nfar right unhappy. They are unhappy most of the time, anyway. But I do \nthink governing from the center, which the 60-vote rule requires, is \none of the great strengths of the Senate.\n\n  It would be a horrible mistake for this body to discard that \nbipartisan mandate that rule imposes on this body. A loss of \nbipartisanship would not only affect the consideration of judges, but \nthe precedent would certainly be in place to affect consideration of \nall other legislation as well.\n  Keeping in mind that this body, even with that rule in place, has \napproved some 205 Federal judges nominated by President Bush, has \nrejected roughly 10, and that we have one of the lowest judicial \nvacancy rates in American history right now--in fact, about 60 percent \nof all Federal appellate judges are appointees of Republican \nadministrations over the last number of years--to suggest somehow there \nis a crisis with judges is a fabrication, frankly. It is simply untrue.\n  Judges are being considered, voted on, approved at a record rate. In \nfact, all of these judges have had up-or-down votes as opposed, sadly, \nto the experience during the Clinton administration where some 60 of \nhis nominees never received a hearing or a vote. In this case every \nnominee has received a vote in committee and on the floor, albeit that \nvote on the floor is consistent with the 60-vote parliamentary rule of \nthe Senate which does require both sides to come together in the \ncenter.\n  Clearly, President Bush can have the approval of 100 percent of his \njudges. All he has to do is to nominate conservative Republican judges \nwho are part of the conservative mainstream of America, a very broad \nrange of discretion that he has. Those judges will be confirmed, as \nhave the 200 plus who have routinely been confirmed by this body.\n  The Senate does have a constitutional obligation of advice and \nconsent on these lifetime appointments. That is one of the reasons why \nthis issue is so profoundly important, because this is not simply a \nlegislative matter that will come and go and be reconsidered at another \ntime. We are considering the appointments of people to high office for \na lifetime. It is imperative the Senate insist that each of these \nindividuals, men and women, be part of the political and judicial \nmainstream of America, albeit we have a Republican President, and \ncertainly he will nominate conservative Republican judges, as well he \nought, and they will be approved in a routine manner as over 200 have \nalready.\n  But there is an importance that the nominees do fall within the \npolitical mainstream, and the one test to see to it that is the case is \nthe 60-vote margin rule where no judge, regardless of what their \npolitical background or judicial background might be, can be approved \nunless, in fact, there is some modest bipartisan support, not an \noverwhelming consensus.\n  Nobody is suggesting a 90-percent rule or 75-percent rule or even the \n66-percent rule which used to be the case for filibusters some years \nago but that there be a 60-vote margin. I don't think that is asking \ntoo much in the name of bipartisanship, in the name of requiring both \nparties to come together, and in the name of diminishing the level of \npartisan hardball that characterizes the other body and to some degree \nhas infected the debate and the rhetoric even here in the Senate.\n  Having witnessed the political dynamic in both bodies, having had the \nhonor to serve in both bodies, having been in both the majority and \nminority, because the rule we are talking about of bipartisanship \nshould prevail regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats are in \nthe majority or the minority, having witnessed all of that and knowing \nwhere my constituents come from in terms of growing weary of the \npartisanship and the political efforts in Washington, DC, to jam one \nidea past another without the need for deliberation, without the need \nfor give and take between the two parties, I have to believe we ought \nto reject the strategies that will play into the hands of the far left \nor the far right and continue the historic rules that have been in \nplace for the Senate which, in fact, not only encourage but require at \nleast a modest level of bipartisanship and deliberative thinking when \nwe consider legislation or lifetime appointments to the U.S. courts.\n  It is my hope cooler heads will prevail, that the historic rules of \nthis body will prevail, and that the Senate will continue to play the \nincredibly important and unique role it has throughout 200 years of \nAmerican history. That is a body where the hot rhetoric of the day is \nset aside and the two political parties are required to come together, \nto approach issues in a more thoughtful, more deliberative and \nbipartisan fashion. We would be a poorer nation, indeed, were it not \nfor that kind of bipartisan mandate that the current rules of the \nSenate insist upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 6 minutes--I believe the majority party had about that added \nto their morning business--if there is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota \nwho just spoke. I just left the Senate Judiciary Committee of which I \nhave been a member for a number of years. It is not just an ordinary \nmeeting of the committee today; it is a historic meeting. It is a \nmeeting I am sure, when they chronicle this episode in the history of \nthe Senate, they will point to as a catalyst for a constitutional \nconfrontation, the likes of which the Senate has never seen in its \nhistory. Let me tell you what is going on.\n  Many times in the history of this country, a President with a popular \nmandate comes to Washington in their second term unhappy with the \njudiciary, unhappy with judges who do not see the world as they do. \nThese Presidents come to the conclusion that with their popular \nmandate, with their majorities in Congress, they can change the \nConstitution, they can change the courts.\n  It is happening with President Bush, but he is not the first \nPresident who has been through this experience. President Thomas \nJefferson, in the beginning of his second term, so angry over the \nopposition party that controlled judgeships, tried to impeach a member \nof the U.S. Supreme Court. He brought the issue to the floor of the \nSenate, to a floor that was dominated by his own political party, and \nsaid: Give me the power to get rid of these outrageous judges. His \nparty turned on him and said: No, the Constitution, Mr. President, is \nmore important than your\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\npower. We reject your notion that you can pack the Supreme Court with \nfriendly judges.\n  Thomas Jefferson was not the last. A President whom I honor and \nvenerate, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in the beginning of his second \nterm came to the White House with this large popular mandate and, in \nfrustration, said: I am sick and tired of the ideas of the New Deal \nbeing killed in that Supreme Court. Give me the power as President, \nFranklin Roosevelt said, and I will replace and add to the membership \nof that Supreme Court until we get Justices who think like I do.\n  He came to this Senate, this Chamber, dominated by Members of his own \npolitical party, and said: Stand with me. You voted for the New Deal, \nnow stand with me. We are going to make sure the Supreme Court goes \nalong. And his party said no. They said: Franklin Roosevelt, the \nConstitution is more important than your power as President. We will \nstand by the Constitution. You are wrong, Mr. President.\n  But look what is happening today. President Bush, not content to have \n95 percent of his judicial nominees approved by this Senate, has now \nsaid: This Republican Party is going to change the rules of the Senate, \nchange the constitutional principles that have guided us so that \nPresident Bush can have every single judicial nominee approved by the \nSenate, bar none.\n  So what will happen in a Senate dominated by the President's party? \nWill they rise in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson's Senate? Will they \nrise in the tradition of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Senate? Will they, \nas the President's party, stand up and say: The Constitution is more \nimportant than the power of any President? Sadly, it appears they will \nnot. They are lapdogs as the President is demanding this power. They \nwill come to the Senate with the so-called nuclear option. It is a good \nname. It is a good name because it signifies the importance and gravity \nof what they will do.\n  The first thing they have to do is break the rules of the Senate. If \nyou want to change a Senate rule, you need 67 votes. They do not have \n67 votes to give President Bush this unbridled power, so they will \nbreak the rules of the Senate with a so-called point of order to change \nthe rules of the Senate and to say that this President, unlike any \nother President in history, will not have his judicial nominees subject \nto the rules of the Senate as we know them.\n  Oh, they argue, this opposition to President Bush's nominees is \nunprecedented. Nobody has ever used the filibuster on a judicial \nnominee. That is what they say. But they are wrong. It has happened 11 \ntimes. Most recently the Republicans used the filibuster against \nPresident Clinton's nominees. They have done it. They have done it \nbecause the rules allowed them to do it. And now, in the middle of the \ngame, they want to change the rules and diminish the power of the \nSenate and attack the principle of checks and balances.\n  The reason this great democracy has survived longer than any in \nhistory is that we have this tension between the branches of \nGovernment--the power of the Presidency checked by the power of \nCongress checked by the power of the judiciary--and this tension among \nthe three branches of Government has given us this democracy that has \nsurvived while others have failed. Yet the majority party, the \nRepublican Party in the Senate, would walk away from that fundamental \nprinciple, for what? For what? So that this President can have every \nsingle judicial nominee without fail? Madam President, 95 percent is \nnot enough? And 205 out of 215 is not enough?\n\n  I have stood with my colleagues and voted against some of these \nnominees. I will do it again. These are men and women far outside the \nmainstream of American political thought. They have been pushed to the \nforefront by special interest groups demanding they get lifetime \nappointment on a court in America to make decisions that will affect \neveryone--every family, every worker, the air we breathe, and the \nprivacy we revere.\n  What is the agenda? We hear this agenda. It is spelled out in detail \nby Congressman Tom DeLay of Texas. He threatens the judiciary: We are \ngoing to dismantle them if they don't agree with me, he says. Tom DeLay \nis going to set the standard for judges in America? This man who was \npushing through the Terry Schiavo case, defying 15 years of court \ndecisions, defying the wishes of that poor woman's family? He was so \nangry when the Federal judges did not agree with him, he said: We will \nget even with you. That is what this is about.\n  So judicial nominees will come to the floor who will be approved who \nwill follow the Tom DeLay school of thinking, who will follow something \nfar outside the mainstream of America.\n  We need to have bipartisanship. We need balance. We need fairness. We \nneed to say to a President of any political party: As powerful as you \nmay be, you are never more powerful than our Constitution. The \nConstitution, which is the one commonality in the Senate, of all the \nthings we argue about and all the things on which we disagree, we--each \nand every one of us--stand proudly next to that well, raise our hands, \nand swear to uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.\n  To my colleagues and friends who are following this debate, the \nconstitutional crisis we are facing is unnecessary. If the President's \nown party has the courage that Thomas Jefferson's party had, that \nFranklin Roosevelt's party had, they would say to the President: You \nhave gone too far. The Constitution is more important than any \nPresident. But, sadly, we are on a path to this crisis.\n  If it occurs--and I hope it does not--it is going to change this \nbody. It is going to change it dramatically. The Senate is so much \ndifferent from the House. The Senate is successful because each and \nevery day you will hear said over and over, ``I ask unanimous \nconsent.'' Unanimous consent is just as the phrase suggests--any \nSenator can object. But it seldom occurs because we agree to move \nforward together--Democrats on this side, Republicans on the other \nside--move forward with the people's business. But if the Republican \nmajority pushes through this constitutional confrontation, destroys \nthis tradition of the Senate, assaults the principle of checks and \nbalances, then the courtesy, the comity, and the cooperation which \nmakes this such a unique institution is in danger.\n  I hope that cooler minds will prevail. I am heartened by the fact \nthat Senator John McCain, a leading Republican, has stood up and begged \nhis fellow Republican colleagues: Don't do this. The Senate and its \ntraditions and the Constitution, Senator McCain says, are more \nimportant than any President or any party.\n  I am confident the Judiciary Committee will send this nomination of \nPriscilla Owen of Texas to the floor. I hope that once it reaches the \ncalendar, cooler minds will prevail and all of us who have sworn to \nuphold this Constitution will honor it by our actions on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4049-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4049-S4052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I thank the floor schedulers for \nreserving time for me this morning. I had hoped to be here at 11:15, \nbut I have been chairing an executive business meeting of the Judiciary \nCommittee where we voted on the nominations of Justice Owen and Justice \nBrown. Not unexpectedly, it went over the planned 11:15 conclusion, but \nI do appreciate the allocation of time. I asked for 45 minutes for a \npresentation, which I am about to make.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition today to address the \nsubject of Senators' independence and dissent. As members of political \nparties,\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\nwe owe loyalty to the party that helped get us elected and which \nenables us to join together to achieve broad policy objectives. \nHistorically, we have found our system of Government functions best \nwith a two-party system. But as part of that historical perspective, we \nhave simultaneously seen loyalty to our Nation take precedence to \nloyalty to party. At certain junctures of American history, the fate of \nour system of Government has rested on the ability of Members of this \nbody to transcend party loyalty for the national interest. I believe \nthe Senate currently faces such a challenge between party line voting \non filibusters and potential voting on the constitutional, or so-called \nnuclear option.\n  I have watched the issue on confirmation of Federal judges fester and \nbecome exacerbated as each party has racheted up the ante beginning \nwith the last 2 years of President Reagan's administration when \nDemocrats took control of the Senate and continuing to the present day.\n  In 1987, upon gaining control of the Senate and the Judiciary \nCommittee, on which I have served since being elected in 1980, the \nDemocrats denied hearings to seven of President Reagan's circuit court \nnominees and denied floor votes to two additional circuit court \nnominees. As a result, the confirmation rate for Reagan's circuit \nnominees fell from 89 percent prior to the Democratic takeover to 65 \npercent afterwards. While the confirmation rate decreased, the length \nof time it took to confirm judges increased. From the Carter \nadministration through the first 6 years of the Reagan administration, \nthe length of the confirmation process for both district and circuit \ncourt seats consistently hovered at approximately 50 days. For \nPresident Reagan's final Congress, after the Democrats took control, \nthe number doubled to an average of 120 days for these nominees to be \nconfirmed.\n  The pattern of delay and denial continued through 4 years of \nPresident George H.W. Bush's administration. President Bush's lower \ncourt nominees waited, on average, 100 days to be confirmed, which was \nabout twice as long as had historically been the case. The Democrats \nalso denied committee hearings for more nominees. President Carter had \n10 nominees who did not receive hearings. For President Reagan, the \nnumber was 30. In the Bush Sr. administration, the number jumped to 58.\n  When we Republicans won the 1994 election and gained the Senate \nmajority, we exacerbated the pattern of delaying and blocking nominees. \nOver the course of President Clinton's presidency, the average number \nof days for the Senate to confirm judicial nominees increased even \nfurther to 192 days for district court nominees and 262 days for \ncircuit court nominees. Through blue slips and holds, 70 of President \nClinton's nominees were blocked. When it became clear that the \nRepublican-controlled Senate would not allow the nominations to move \nforward, President Clinton withdrew 12 of those nominations and chose \nnot to renominate 16.\n  During that time I urged my Republican colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee to confirm well-qualified Democratic nominees. For example, I \nbroke ranks with many of my colleagues on the Republican side to speak \nand vote in favor of the confirmation of Marsha Berzon and Richard \nPaez, both to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. While many of my \nRepublican colleagues criticized me for voting for Berzon and Paez, I \nthoroughly reviewed their records and determined that both were \nqualified for the positions to which they had been nominated. While I \ndid not agree with Ms. Berzon and Mr. Paez on every issue, I realized \nthe importance of working toward solutions when the Senate is at an \nimpasse on a nomination.\n\n  After the 2002 elections with control of the Senate returning to \nRepublicans, the Democrats resorted to the filibuster on ten circuit \ncourt nominations, which was the most extensive use of the tactic in \nthe Nation's history. The filibusters started with Miguel Estrada, one \nof the most talented and competent appellate lawyers in the country. \nThe Democrats followed with filibusters against nine other circuit \ncourt nominees. During the 108th Congress, there were 20 cloture \nmotions on ten nominations. All 20 failed.\n  To this unprecedented move, President Bush responded by making for \nthe first time in the Nation's history two recess appointments of \nnominees who had been successfully filibustered by the Democrats. That \nimpasse was broken when President Bush agreed to refrain from further \nrecess appointments.\n  Against this background of bitter and angry recriminations with each \nparty serially trumping the other party to ``get even'' or, really, to \ndominate, the Senate now faces dual threats, one called the filibuster \nand the other the ``constitutional'' or ``nuclear'' option, which rival \nthe US/USSR confrontation of mutual assured destruction. Both \nsituations are accurately described by the acronym ``MAD'', which was \nused for the confrontation between our Nation and the Soviet Union.\n  We Republicans are threatening to employ the ``constitutional'' or \n``nuclear'' option to require only a majority vote to end filibusters. \nThe Democrats are threatening to retaliate by stopping the Senate \nagenda on all matters except national security and homeland defense. \nEach ascribes to the other the responsibility for ``blowing the place \nup.''\n  The gridlock occurs at a time when we expect a U.S. Supreme Court \nvacancy within the next few months. If a filibuster would leave an 8-\nperson court, we could expect many 4-to-4 votes since the Court now \noften decides cases with 5-to-4 votes. A Supreme Court tie vote would \nrender the Court dysfunctional, leaving in effect the circuit court \ndecision with many splits among the circuits, so the rule of law would \nbe suspended on many major issues.\n  On these critical issues with these cataclysmic consequences, I urge \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle to study the issues and to \nvote their consciences independent of party dictation. I have not \nrendered a decision on how I would vote on the constitutional/nuclear \noption, but instead have been working to break the impasse by \nconfirming or rejecting the previously filibustered nominees by up or \ndown votes.\n  As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I selected William Myers as \nthe first of the filibustered judges to be reported out of Committee \nfor Senate floor action. Two Democrats, Senator Joe Biden and Senator \nBen Nelson, had voted in the 108th Congress to end the filibuster on \nMr. Myers, and Senator Ken Salazar made a campaign promise to support \nan end to the Myers filibuster, although he has since equivocated on \nthat commitment. Being only 2 or 3 votes shy of 60, 55 Republicans plus \npresumably two or three Democrats, I thought Myers had a realistic \nchance for confirmation.\n  With any judicial nominee, or any Senators for that matter, opponents \ncan pick at their record. On the totality of his record, as \ndemonstrated at two hearings and the Judiciary Committee Executive \nsession, Myers is qualified for confirmation. Beyond the issue of his \nown qualifications, his conservative credentials would lend some \nbalance to the Ninth Circuit.\n  The Democrats have signaled their intent not to filibuster Thomas \nGriffith or Judge Terrence Boyle which may help to diffuse the \nsituation. In addition, intensive efforts are being made to clear three \nof President Bush's nominees for the 6th Circuit. If enough of the \nPresident's nominees can be confirmed, we may be able to deflate the \ncontroversy without a vote on the constitutional/nuclear option. That \nis what I am trying to do in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  In due course, I will have more to say about the other pending Bush \nnominees; but for now, I only urge my colleagues to be independent and \nto examine the nominees' records on the merits without having their \nvotes determined by party loyalty.\n  The fact is that all, or almost all, Senators want to avoid the \ncrisis. I have had many conversations with my Democrat colleagues about \nthe filibuster of judicial nominees. Many of them have told me that \nthey do not personally believe it is a good idea to filibuster \nPresident Bush's judicial nominees. They believe that this \nunprecedented use of the filibuster does damage to this institution and \nto the prerogatives of the President. Yet despite their concerns, they \ngave in to\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\nparty loyalty and voted repeatedly to filibuster Federal judges in the \nlast Congress.\n  Likewise, there are many Republicans in this body who question the \nwisdom of the constitutional or nuclear option. They recognize that \nsuch a step would be a serious blow to the rights of the minority that \nhave always distinguished this body from the House of Representatives. \nKnowing that the Senate is a body that depends upon collegiality and \ncompromise to pass even the smallest resolution, they worry that the \nrule change will impair the ability of this institution to function.\n  The importance of independence was noted on November 3, 1774 in a \nspeech of historical importance to the Electors of Bristol by Edmund \nBurke, a Member of the British Parliament:\n\n       ``. . . his (the legislators) unbiased opinion, his mature \n     judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to \n     sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. \n     Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his \n     judgment; and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he \n     sacrifices it to your opinion.''\n\n  President John F. Kennedy, while a member of this body, wrote \nProfiles in Courage which cities the roles of courageous Senators who \nchose the national good over party loyalty. He summed it up on one of \nhis famous quotations: ``Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.''\n  As President Kennedy wrote in the introduction to his book:\n\n       Of course, both major parties today seek to serve the \n     national interest. They would do so in order to obtain the \n     broadest base of support, if for no nobler reason. But when \n     party and officeholder differ as to how the national interest \n     is to be served, we must place first the responsibility we \n     owe not to our party or even to our constituents but to our \n     individual consciences.\n\n  Kennedy further noted, in words which ring as true today as they did \ndecades ago:\n\n       Today the challenge of political courage looms larger than \n     ever before. For our everyday life is becoming so saturated \n     with the tremendous power of mass communications that any \n     unpopular or unorthodox course arouses a storm of protests \n     such as John Quincy Adams--under attack in 1807--could never \n     have envisioned. Our political life is becoming so expensive, \n     so mechanized and so dominated by professional politicians \n     and public relations men that the idealist who dreams of \n     independent statesmanship is rudely awakened by the \n     necessities of election and accomplishment.\n\n  Continuing, Kennedy wrote:\n\n       Of course, it would be much easier if we could all continue \n     to think in traditional political patters--of liberalism and \n     conservatism, as Republicans and Democrats, from the \n     viewpoint of North and South, management and labor, business \n     and consumer or some equally narrow framework. It would be \n     more comfortable to continue to move and vote in platoons, \n     joining whomever of our colleagues are equally enslaved by \n     some current fashion, raging prejudice or popular \n     movement. But today this nation cannot tolerate the luxury \n     of such lazy political habits. Only the strength and \n     progress and peaceful change that come from independent \n     judgment and individual ideas--and even from the \n     unorthodox, and the eccentric--can enable us to surpass \n     that foreign ideology that fears free thought more than it \n     fears hydrogen bombs.\n\n  Beyond his stirring words, Kennedy provides us examples. John Quincy \nAdams' faced such a controversy when English ships seized American \nships and conscripted American sailors who could not ``prove'' that \nthey were not British subjects. Adams, a Federalist, was incensed. \nUltimately, he voted with President Jefferson and the Republicans to \nenact an embargo against Great Britain. Yet most other Federalists, \nincluding those in Adams' home state of Massachusetts, preferred to \nmake excuses for the British behavior and urge caution. Realizing the \npolitical suicide he was committing, Adams remarked to a friend, ``This \nmeasure will cost you and me our seats but private interest must not be \nput in opposition to public good.'' His prediction was right. He lost \nhis seat.\n  Kennedy recounts further in ``Profiles in Courage,'' how Senator \nThomas Hart Benton, a Democrat from the slave-holding state of \nMissouri, elevated his love of the Union and his belief in manifest \ndestiny over populist notions of secessionist Southern states. Though \nBenton owned slaves and was one of the few Senators to bring them with \nhim to his Washington home, he refused to speak in favor of or against \nslavery in emergent states such as California and New Mexico, as they \nwere added to the Union. Benton was known for his fiery rhetoric and \nindependent streak throughout his thirty years in the Senate. In a \nprescient, foreboding statement, one of Benton's Missouri \ncontemporaries remarked, ``[a]t an early period of [Benton's] \nexistence, while reading Plutarch, he determined that if it should ever \nbecome necessary for the good of his country, he would sacrifice his \nown political existence.'' Senator Benton did exactly that.\n  Courageous Senators and this institution as a whole resisted great \npolitical pressure to reject steps that would have threatened the \nseparation of judicial powers and the independence of the President. \nThese instances were the 1804-1805 impeachment and trial of Associate \nJustice Samuel Chase and the 1868 impeachment of President Andrew \nJohnson.\n  Republicans under Thomas Jefferson sought to have Associate Justice \nSamuel Chase of the United States Supreme Court impeached in 1804. The \noutcome of Justice Chase's trial would largely determine whether the \njudiciary could remain independent or become a subordinate branch of \ngovernment where justices looked to the legislature for patronage and \njob security.\n  It was Justice Chase's penchant for politicking and expressing \nFederalist views from the bench that got him in trouble.\n  Justice Chase was tried before the Senate. Aaron Burr, the \ncontroversial Vice President who was wanted in two states for his \ndueling homicide of Alexander Hamilton, presided at the hearing. During \nclosing arguments, Justice Chase's counsel, Luther Martin, a Maryland \ndelegate to the Constitutional Convention, predicted the outcome and \nnoted the wisdom of the Founding Fathers in the constitutional \nprovision giving the Senate the power to try and decide cases of \nimpeachment. There were Senators in the Chase impeachment proceeding \nwho transcended the pressures of their party, and bravely cast votes of \n``not guilty'' for Justice Chase, thereby protecting the independence \nof the U.S. Judiciary.\n\n  A similar great example of Senate independence occurred in the \nimpeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson. President Johnson \nachieved the ire of the Congress, and the public generally, when he \nsuspended the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, in violation of the 10-\nyear Oath-of-Office Act which passed over the President's veto. That \nlegislation prevented the President from removing, without the consent \nof the Senate, all new officeholders whose appointments require \nconfirmation of that body. Public opinion ran very high against \nPresident Johnson.\n  In ``Profiles in Courage,'' Senator Kennedy again described the \nunfolding drama:\n\n       To their dismay, at a preliminary Republican caucus, six \n     courageous Republicans indicated that the evidence produced \n     so far was not in their opinion sufficient to convict Johnson \n     . . .\n\n  There were public outcries and party outcries against the deviation \nfrom their party loyalty. The party said: ``All must stand together!'' \nAll but one Republican Senator announced their opinions. One who would \nnot was Edmond G. Ross of Kansas.\n\n       The Radicals were outraged that a Senator from such an \n     anti-Johnson stronghold as Kansas could be doubtful. Indeed, \n     despite public clamor and partisan outcry against him, \n     Senator Ross was resolute in his unwillingness to signal his \n     thoughts in advance of the ultimate vote on the Articles of \n     Impeachment. As the impeachment trial droned on, he remained \n     the only unknown voter among Republican Senators.\n\n  Ross ultimately voted not guilty, in defiance of party loyalty. \nReflecting on what colored his odd voting pattern, given his disdain \nfor President Johnson, and his near mechanical party loyalty until that \nsingle moment, Ross said, in historic words:\n\n       In a large sense, the independence of the executive office \n     as a coordinate branch of government was on trial. . . . If . \n     . . the President must step down . . . a disgraced man and a \n     political outcast . . . upon insufficient proofs and from \n     partisan considerations, the office of President would be \n     degraded, cease to be a coordinate branch of the government, \n     and ever after subordinated to the legislative will. It would \n     practically have revolutionized our splendid political fabric \n     into a partisan Congressional autocracy. . . . This \n     government had never faced so insidious a danger . . . \n     control by the worst element of American politics.\n\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\n\n  Ross went on to say:\n\n       If Andrew Johnson were acquitted by a nonpartisan vote . . \n     . America would pass the danger point of partisan rule and \n     that intolerance which so often characterizes the sway of \n     great majorities and makes them dangerous.\n\n  Mr. President, I know morning business has expired. But in the \nabsence of any other Senator seeking recognition, I ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed for an additional 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, independence and dissent from the \nmajority view has a great tradition in our country, further exemplified \nby independent, thoughtful U.S. Supreme Court Justices who formulated \nimportant legal principles which were later embraced as the law of the \nland.\n  In a series of powerful and famous dissents, Justice Oliver Wendell \nHolmes and Justice Louis Brandeis, articulated a logic so compelling \nthat it became the majority view within a generation. Their examples \nserve as a reminder of the importance of dissent and independence.\n  As a law student, I was inspired by Justice Holmes's dissent in \nAbrams v. United States, when he wrote:\n\n       But when men have realized that time has upset many \n     fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they \n     believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the \n     ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in \n     ideas--that the best test of truth is the power of the \n     thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the \n     market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their \n     wishes can be successfully carried out. That, at any rate, is \n     the theory of our constitution.\n\n  The theme of free-thought and independence, so artfully articulated \nby Justice Holmes, is also the foundation of ``Profiles in Courage.'' I \nthink the essence of that theme was best summarized by then-Senator \nJohn Kennedy, when he said:\n\n       Foreign ideology . . . fears free thought more than it \n     fears hydrogen bombs.\n  Free thought is the ultimate road to truth. Free thought is the \nenergy that drives the political machine that leads to good public \npolicy in our society. Free thought, and its companion, freedom of \nspeech and assembly and press, are the core attributes of democracy \nthat are today taking root around the world.\n  ``Free trade in ideas'' cannot flourish when Senators are constrained \nto follow a political party's edict. When the merits of individual \njudicial nominees are debated and considered, without the counter-\nmarjoritarian filibuster preventing resolution, only then do we achieve \nHolmes's ``best test of truth.'' Similarly, if the constitutional/\nnuclear option is debated and considered without adherence to the party \nline, we will pursue the tested process to find the truth that is ``the \nonly ground upon which [our] wishes can be successfully carried out.''\n  The value of independence, expressed in the dissenting opinions of \nHolmes and Brandeis, called public attention to values which later \nbecame the pillars of our democracy. Dissenting in Olmstead v. United \nStates, Justice Brandeis said:\n\n       The makers of our Constitution conferred, as against the \n     Government, the right to be let alone--the most comprehensive \n     of rights and the right most valued by civilized men. To \n     protect that right, every unjustifiable intrusion by the \n     Government upon the privacy of the individual, whatever the \n     means employed, must be deemed a violation of the \n     [Constitution].\n\n  That view of the most basic ``right to be let alone'' later became \nthe pillar of civil rights in our society in many contexts. It is the \nfoundation of today's debate on the Patriot Act where representatives \nof the political right and the political left reference that value as \nthe barometer of the balance of governmental power to provide for our \nNation's security.\n  The Holmes/Brandeis independent views, expressed in Supreme Court \ndissents, later became the law of the land on such important issues as \nfreedom of speech, prohibiting child labor, limiting working hours, and \nperemptory challenges in criminal cases.\n  These illustrations of Senatorial and judicial independence \ndemonstrate the value of free thinking in deciding what is best for our \nNation's long-range interests. Central to the definition of \ndeliberation is thought. And we pride ourselves on being the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. And thought requires independence--not \nresponse to party loyalty or any other form of dictation. The lessons \nof our best days as a nation should serve as a model today for Senators \nto vote their consciences on the confirmation of judges and on the \nconstitutional/nuclear option.\n  If we fail, then I fear this Senate will descend the staircase of \npolitical gamesmanship and division. But if we succeed, our Senate will \nregain its place as the world's preeminent deliberative body.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4052-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session for the consideration of calendar No. 69, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of John D. Negroponte, of \nNew York, to be Director of National Intelligence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 4 \nhours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, and the Democratic time will be equally divided between the \nSenator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, and the Senator from \nOregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I rise today in strong support of the nomination of \nAmbassador John D. Negroponte to serve as our Nation's first Director \nof National Intelligence.\n  The committee held Ambassador Negroponte's confirmation hearing on \nTuesday, April 12, and voted favorably to report his nomination to the \nfull Senate on Thursday, April 14.\n  Now, the speed with which the committee acted upon this nomination \nand the nomination of LTG, soon to be four-star general, Michael \nHayden, to be the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence, \nreally underscores the importance the committee, and I believe the \nSenate, places on continuing and ensuring reform of our Nation's \nintelligence community and, as a result, our national security.\n  While our intelligence community has a great number of successes--let \nme emphasize that--of which intelligence professionals should be \njustifiably proud--and the problem here is that when we have successes \nin the intelligence community, many times either the community or those \nof us who serve on the committee or those who are familiar with those \nsuccesses cannot say anything about them because it is classified--but \nthe intelligence failures associated with the attacks of 9/11 and the \nintelligence community's flawed assessments of Iraq's WMD programs \nunderscored the need for fundamental change across the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  In my years on the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have met many of \nthese hard-working men and women of the intelligence community who work \nday in and day out with one goal in mind; that is, to keep this Nation \nsecure and our people safe.\n  They are held back, however, by a flawed system that does not permit \nthem to work as a community to do their best work. So we need to honor \ntheir commitment and their sacrifices by giving them an intelligence \ncommunity worthy of their efforts and capable of meeting their \naspirations and our expectations of them.\n  So responding to that demonstrated need for reform, Congress really \ncreated the position of Director of National Intelligence with the \nintent of giving one person the responsibility and authority to provide \nthe leadership that the Nation's intelligence apparatus has desperately \nneeded and to exercise command and control across all the elements of \nthe intelligence community.\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\n  In short, through legislation, we created the DNI, the Director of \nNational Intelligence, to provide the intelligence community with a \nclear chain of command and the accountability that comes with that.\n\n  To facilitate that chain of command, and to foster accountability, \nthe National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 gave the DNI \nsignificant management authorities and tools, including expanded budget \nauthority, acquisition, personnel, and tasking authorities.\n  These authorities, however, are limited in significant ways, and the \nlegislation leaves certain ambiguities about the DNI's authorities.\n  As a result, there are questions about the DNI's ability to bring \nabout the kind of change and true reform necessary to address the \nfailures highlighted by the 9/11 attacks and the assessments of Iraq's \nWMD programs.\n  So the task of resolving these ambiguities and questions will fall to \nthe first Director of National Intelligence. As the WMD Commission \npointed out in its recent report, the DNI will have to be adept at \nmanaging more through resource allocation than through command.\n  Moreover, the first DNI will define the power and scope of future \nDirectors of National Intelligence and will determine, in large \nmeasure, the success of our efforts to truly reform the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Bringing about that reform is not going to be easy. Numerous \ncommissions--many commissions--have identified the same failings as \nthose that resulted in the legislation that created the DNI. Yet \nprevious reform efforts have proven largely fruitless.\n  So immune to reform is the intelligence community that the WMD \nCommission described it as a ``closed world'' with ``an almost perfect \nrecord of resisting external recommendations.''\n  Allow me to relay one example to demonstrate this point.\n  Over 3 years have passed since the September 11 attacks, and the \nelements of the community have not made the progress that we want in \nsharing intelligence data amongst the community. The distinguished vice \nchairman and I call that ``information access.''\n  Elements within the intelligence community, unfortunately, continue \nto act--some elements--as though they own the intelligence data they \ncollect rather than treating that data as belonging to the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  As a result of the community's failure to repudiate outdated \nrestrictions on information access, and its refusal to revisit legal \ninterpretations and policy decisions that predate the threats now \nconfronting the United States, impediments to information access are \nreemerging--reemerging, even today--in the very programs designed to \naddress the problem.\n  Clearly, then, the Nation's first Director of National Intelligence \nwill face tremendous challenges and will require unwavering support \nfrom both Congress and the White House.\n  I am pleased President Bush has made it very clear that the DNI will \nhave strong authority in his administration. We in Congress must do our \npart, and we begin with the nomination of Ambassador Negroponte.\n  The President has made an excellent choice in choosing the Ambassador \nto serve as the first DNI. He has dedicated more than 40 years of \nservice to our country. Over the course of his public service career, \nthe Senate has confirmed him seven times, including five times for \nambassadorial positions in Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines, the \nUnited Nations and, of course, most recently in Iraq. Ambassador \nNegroponte has also held a number of key positions within the executive \nbranch, including serving as Deputy National Security Advisor.\n  In short, his career has been dedicated to intelligence and national \nsecurity matters, and he has a great deal of experience to offer as the \nnew Director of National Intelligence. He is well suited for this \nposition. I look forward to working with him.\n  In my discussions with Ambassador Negroponte, I have made it clear \nthat Congress and the American people expect him to make a difference \nin the intelligence community. I must say, on behalf of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence and on behalf of my vice chairman and \nmyself, we have promised to conduct aggressive, preemptive oversight in \nregard to helping the DNI answer the challenges he will face with \nregard to the capabilities we have or do not have with regard to the \nintelligence community.\n  We expect him to break down those barriers to information access I \nalluded to earlier. We expect him to improve the human intelligence \ncapabilities we need. And ultimately, we expect him to provide \nleadership and accountability. In response to these questions, during \nhis confirmation hearing, the Ambassador simply responded ``I will'' \nwith conviction.\n  Clearly Ambassador Negroponte will face significant challenges. He is \ngoing to carry heavy burdens. I am convinced, however, he has the \ncharacter, the expertise, and the leadership skills required to \nsuccessfully meet these challenges and to shoulder these \nresponsibilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this nomination, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I join with the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee in what he has said. Today the Senate is \nconsidering the nomination of Ambassador John Negroponte to become the \nNation's first Director of National Intelligence. Personally, I \nstrongly support this nomination, and I will discuss the reasons why in \na moment.\n  First, however, as the chairman did, I am going to take a few minutes \nto describe how critical this new position is to our country and its \nfuture, the magnitude of the challenges Ambassador Negroponte will \nface.\n  In 1947, Congress created the Central Intelligence Agency and the \nDirector of Central Intelligence. The Cold War was upon us and the \nNation needed intelligence about our new adversary. The structure we \nput in place at that time to keep tabs on the Soviet Union grew and \ntook on additional missions over the next 40 years. But the \nintelligence community stayed primarily focused on that one target of \nthe Soviet Union.\n  Then in 1990, the Soviet Union dissolved. The world changed \ndramatically, but our intelligence organizations for the most part did \nnot. As a consequence, we have for the past 15 years made do with an \nintelligence system designed to penetrate and collect information about \na single static adversary. There was no one in charge to force change \nfrom within, and before September 11 of 2001, there was little impetus \nfor change from without.\n  The National Security Act of 1947, the genesis of all of this, \ndesignated the DCI to serve as the head of the Central Intelligence \nAgency, also the principal adviser to the President on intelligence \nmatters, and the head of the U.S. intelligence community--all three of \nthose assignments.\n\n  The Director of Central Intelligence ran the CIA, advised the \nPresident, but, frankly, never exercised the third responsibility, \nwhich is probably the most important other than advising the President, \nand that is managing the intelligence community itself.\n  Even after the events, tragic though they might have been, of 9/11, \nit took 3 years, two major investigations of those events, and the \nstunning intelligence failures prior to the Iraq war to break through \nthe entrenched interests and to achieve reform that created the \nposition of director of something called national intelligence, all of \nit.\n  The difficulty involved in the birth of this new office serves as a \nwarning for the challenges that the Ambassador, if confirmed, as I hope \nhe will be, will face. Bureaucracies are amazingly slow to change. That \ndoesn't say anything bad about the people. That is the way the world \nworks, whether it is corporate, private, or whatever. The bureaucracies \nare tenacious in defending their turf. Some of the stories are \nremarkable within the 15 intelligence agencies the Ambassador will have \nto oversee. Reform of the intelligence community will involve stepping \non the turf of some of the most powerful bureaucracies in Washington. \nAnd first and foremost among those is the Department of Defense.\n  Eighty percent of our intelligence spending is in the DOD budget. The \nincoming Director of National Intelligence will have to quickly \nestablish a close working relationship with the Secretary of Defense, \nbut it must be a\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\nrelationship of equals, and Ambassador Negroponte must be willing to \nexercise the authority given him by the legislation and the President \nwhen he and the Secretary differ. In effect, the Director of National \nIntelligence supersedes the head of the Department of Defense.\n  Ambassador Negroponte also will encounter and need to manage the CIA, \nan organization accustomed to operating with tremendous autonomy, a \nworld unto itself. Some of these agencies, such as the National \nSecurity Agency--they are called NSA--get acronyms, ``no such \nagency''--that is part of the way their world operates. That is not to \ndenigrate them, their public service, their public commitment, their \nwillingness to offer up their lives for their country. But bureaucracy \nof a huge magnitude it surely is.\n  Then there is the FBI, an agency which is dominated by its law \nenforcement history and struggling to make itself into a full partner \nin the intelligence community. Some question whether that can be done; \nmy mind is still open to it. They are trying. Most people say it is \nworking at the top but not in the middle, because if you are a lawyer, \nyou have a yellow pad, you go arrest somebody for breaking the law. If \nyou are an intelligence officer, you find somebody you are suspicious \nof, and you don't arrest that person. You surveil that person, you \ntrail that person, maybe for weeks, months, to find out where that \nperson takes you and what intelligence we can learn from that.\n  But these are powerful organizations with very proud histories. They \nare populated by dedicated and talented public servants who have \ncontributed to our security for decades. But our needs are now \ndifferent. All of these agencies now must change the way they do \nbusiness.\n  Ambassador Negroponte takes charge at a time when the intelligence \ncommunity is reeling from criticism for the lapses prior to 9/11 and \nthe significant failures related to prewar intelligence on Iraq.\n\n  The chairman and I worry about that because it affects morale. One \ndoesn't want to affect morale. But on the other hand, intelligence \nagencies have to reflect the current needs of this country and act \naccordingly.\n  The loose amalgam of 15 intelligence agencies needs a leader who can \nchange not simply the boxes on an organizational chart but the way we \ndo intelligence. The different agencies traditionally have collected \nintelligence from their sources, analyzed it, put it into their \ndatabases, and then shared it as they deemed appropriate. The chairman \nand I are very fond--both of us--of saying the word ``share'' is now \noutmoded. There is a need-to-know basis from time to time. But if you \nshare something, that means you own it and that you make the decision \nyou will share it with somebody. We prefer the modern word for \nintelligence which is going to have to be ``access,'' that anybody in \nthat business has access to that intelligence automatically by \ndefinition unless there is a particular need-to-know restriction.\n  The Director of National Intelligence has to create a new culture \nwhere the process of producing intelligence is coordinated across \nagencies from the beginning. The collection strategies for various \ntargets need to be unified, and the intelligence collected needs to be \navailable to everyone with the proper clearance and the need to know \nthat information.\n  That is the concept of jointness in operation that the Presiding \nOfficer knows well because he is on the Armed Services Committee, as is \nmy colleague, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Jointness is \na concept the military has used and made work very effectively. It goes \nback to the Goldwater-Nichols Act almost 20 years ago, and it is \nsomething the Intelligence Committee is going to have to learn how to \ndo. Making fundamental changes is absolutely essential in order to make \nsure our intelligence is timely, objective, and independent of \npolitical consideration.\n  The credibility of the intelligence community--and, by extension, the \ncredibility of the United States--has suffered when key intelligence \nreports such as the prewar intelligence report on Iraq failed the test \nof being timely, objective, and independent as required by law. It is \nnot something they just ought to be doing; it is required by the 1947 \nNational Security Act.\n  Making major changes in the way the community operates and produces \nintelligence will be the first step for Ambassador Negroponte. He also \nmust instill a sense of accountability. On this many of us feel \nstrongly. The joint inquiry conducted by the Senate and the House \nIntelligence Committees into the events of 9/11 called for \naccountability for the mistakes made prior to the attack where \nthousands lost their lives. The WMD commission, which finished its \nwork, also highlighted this issue.\n  But despite these findings and despite what one would think the \ncountry would assume and expect, no one has been held accountable for \nthe numerous failures to share critical intelligence and act on \nintelligence warnings in the year and a half prior to the 9/11 attacks. \nLikewise there has been a lack of accountability over the failings in \nthe collection, analysis, and use of intelligence prior to the Iraq war \nitself.\n  Accountability means people get fired or people get demoted or people \nget scolded or, concurrently, people are patted on the back, rewarded, \nencouraged, motivated further, held up before their colleagues as \nexemplary because they have done something particularly well.\n  So the Ambassador is not only going to have to deal with problems \nfrom the past, but he will have to face immediately the growing scandal \nsurrounding the collection of intelligence through the detention, \ninterrogation, and rendition of suspected terrorists and insurgents. We \nhave been subjected to an almost daily deluge of accusations of abuse \nstemming from these operations.\n  The intelligence we gain through these interrogations is, frankly, \ntoo important to allow shortcomings in this program to continue, and \nthe Director of National Intelligence will be the official responsible \nfor ensuring we have a comprehensive, consistent, legal, and \noperational policy on the detention and interrogation of prisoners \nbecause there is enormous flux in that whole area right now. The lack \nof clarity in these areas has led to confusion and likely contributed \nto the abuse we have witnessed.\n  Dealing with the many challenges is a tall order. But if anybody can \nsucceed in the position of DNI, Director of National Intelligence, an \nentirely new position in the U.S. Government, one of the three or four \ntoughest jobs in Washington, that person is Ambassador Negroponte. He \nhas a 40-year career of public service, as has been indicated, in some \nof most difficult and critical posts in the Foreign Service: Vietnam, \nthe Paris peace talks, South and Central America, the U.N., and most \nrecently in Baghdad.\n\n  He has been doing this for 40 years. One of the things I have \nappreciated particularly about him is that he is not a military person, \nnot a political person, not an intelligence person. He is a diplomat. \nHe is somebody who, through his entire career, has engaged in \nunderstanding the nuances of the cultures we have to deal with in the \nintelligence world and what follows intelligence across the world. But \nhe also knows a great deal about intelligence and the military \noperations and the political aspects of life simply because you cannot \nbe an ambassador and avoid those things.\n  He is a diplomat, a manager, a negotiator, which is crucial to \nbringing these agencies together and to go back and forth with the \nPresident and the Congress. He has extensive knowledge of the workings \nof the Government. That is a very prosaic statement, until one takes it \nat face value. Most people don't. They have extensive knowledge about \ncertain parts of Government. He covers the ballfield. He has the \ntemperament, standing, and self-confidence, frankly, to deal with the \nWashington bureaucracy. He has a great deal of confidence in himself, \nand he ought to--he has the backing of somebody called the President of \nthe United States of America.\n  The Intelligence Reform Act provides the Director of National \nIntelligence with considerable authority. But in Washington, DC, the \nsupport of the President is invaluable in exercising authority. To put \nit another way, a person loses their stature pretty quickly if the \nPresident is not backing that\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\nperson in high-profile decisions, particularly in those instances when \ndecisions meet resistance from the heads of other departments and other \nagencies which have full call on the President and his attention. The \nPresident's support will be absolutely critical to Ambassador \nNegroponte's success--and succeed he must, Mr. President.\n  The United States faces a period of enormous uncertainty and threat. \nThe problems of international terrorism will be with us for many \ndecades, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses a \ndanger at this minute for the entire world and will for decades to \ncome.\n  These are difficult targets for the intelligence community, but these \nare the things that threaten our security every moment. These are the \nissues the intelligence community must master. They are our front line \nof defense. The warfighter has not yet engaged properly until the \nintelligence has been collected and disseminated and policy is made \nfrom that. Ambassador Negroponte must lead all of us into a new era on \nintelligence. I think he is very well suited for the task, and I look \nforward to his swift confirmation.\n  In closing, I also hope the Senate moves very quickly to confirm the \nPresident's nominee to be Principal Deputy Director of National \nIntelligence, and that is LTG Michael Hayden. This is a tandem made in \nHeaven. General Hayden understands the military, the lifelong service \nof it. He understands intelligence. He is Director of the National \nSecurity Agency. He has a profound, intuitive, knowledge-based \nunderstanding of what is under the rocks and what is plainly in sight, \nwhat is plainly good or wrong about the intelligence profession. He has \nled the National Security Agency for the last 6 years. It is an \ninteresting fact that in the National Security Agency, under their \nroof, is the largest collection of mathematicians in this world. That \nmay be known or not; I suspect it is. But these people do incredibly \nimportant things. He has led them now, having been reappointed three \ntimes. Together, Ambassador Negroponte and General Hayden make a \npowerful team. I am very pleased to support them both.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the vice chairman yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for a very \ncomprehensive statement. I thank him for what I think is a very \naccurate statement, more especially with the history he has outlined of \nthe intelligence community; more especially with the contributions of \nthe men and women within the intelligence community who have successes \nthat obviously you cannot talk about, but the obvious need for reform \nbecause of what we have gone through; especially for the Senator's \ncomment in relationship to the new DNI in relation to the Department of \nDefense. That was right on target.\n  There has been a great deal of comment, as the vice chairman knows, \nthat 80 percent of the funding of the intelligence budget goes to the \nmilitary, and in terms of being the majority user of intelligence \nnobody would quarrel with that. I don't know of any Member of Congress \nwho would say otherwise. I think we have made great progress between \nthe intelligence and the military and the real-time analysis or real-\ntime intelligence to the warfighter, even though our challenges in \nparts of the world are very great. But I point out--and I think the \nvice chairman agrees--that the principal user of intelligence--not \nmajority but principal user of intelligence--is not the military, as \nimportant as they are; it is the President of the United States and the \nNational Security Council and the Congress of the United States to \ndetermine policy.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing that out and I thank him for a very \nfine statement and also for being a fine vice chairman. We aggressively \ntried to provide insight and advice to the new DNI.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If my friend will yield, I further say that the \nPresident made an enormous contribution, which was sort of generally \noverlooked--not by those of us who work in this field of intelligence--\nwhen he made it very clear and made an executive decision that 80 \npercent of the budget that goes to the military, minus a few very \nspecific tactical areas, and necessarily so, would be under the \nDirector of National Intelligence. That was the President declaring \nthat whoever is in that position will control the funding. \nComplications can arise, but the President has been clear about who is \ngoing to run this operation, and that is very important.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I could ask for unanimous consent to lock \nin the order, but I think I can just make a suggestion with the few \nSenators we have here. I am sure more will come. Senator Bond has a \ntime conflict and would like to be recognized for 10 minutes. Senator \nFeinstein has been waiting, as has Senator Wyden. And then Senator \nCollins will come to the floor very quickly, one of the coauthors of \nthe Intelligence Reform Act. If we can have an understanding that that \nwould be the order, I think that would be appropriate.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent that the time consumed by any quorum \ncalls be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am more than happy to yield 10 minutes \nto a valued member of the committee, the Senator from Missouri, Mr. \nBond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Roberts. As we all know, \nthis February, President Bush nominated Ambassador John Negroponte to \nserve as the Nation's first Director of National Intelligence. I rise \ntoday in strong support of his confirmation for this demanding \nposition. I agree with the chairman and vice chairman; I can think of \nfew people as well suited by experience, intelligence, and dedication \nto tackle this assignment. I heard the remarks of the vice chairman, \nand I wish to associate myself with those very fine remarks--\nparticularly his remarks about General Hayden who is nominated to be \nthe Principal Deputy. We are not talking about his nomination today, \nbut I associate myself with the high commendation that has been made of \nthis gentleman, who also deserves prompt confirmation, so that we can \nget about the critically important work of providing intelligence. \nAmbassador Negroponte's wealth of experience and outstanding track \nrecord should be well known to all of us. A proven leader and manager \nin our national security establishment, he served five tours as chief \nof mission in U.S. Embassies. He has worked closely not only with \nfrontline intelligence officers but himself served as Deputy National \nSecurity Adviser. He has solid experience working with the U.S. \nmilitary, as well as representatives of Cabinet departments. Most \ntelling, his recent experience as U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and the \nUnited Nations provide him with a unique view into the spectrum of \nnational security challenges we now face and how best to construct an \nintelligence apparatus to meet those challenges. He understands that \nwhile collecting, analyzing, and disseminating good intelligence are \nnot only requirements of a sound foreign policy and a secure homeland, \nthey are key elements. Most important, these are processes in dire need \nof repair. The Ambassador is the right choice at the right time to take \non these challenges.\n\n  As we continue our war on terror against those who would do us harm, \nour intelligence community must also work to stem the proliferation and \nprevent the use of weapons of mass destruction, maintain a watchful eye \non global competitors and adversaries, be alert to emerging threats, \nand provide guidance to policymakers on how best to positively \ninfluence global change. Most importantly, they must be able to provide \npolicymakers with timely, accurate, and authoritative intelligence to \nmanage, instead of reacting to looming threats. In short, the \nAmbassador has his work cut out for him.\n  He will have to invigorate human intelligence capabilities. Our spies \nand agents must not only collect better intelligence, they must work to \npenetrate the governments of rogue states, terrorist and insurgent \norganizations, and closed societies where some of the most devious \nplots to attack America and its people and interests, as well as our \nallies, are hatched. We know we have fallen short in our human \nintelligence--or HUMINT--capabilities leading up to the conflicts in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. We are going to have to correct that and we look \nfor the DNI's leadership to do that.\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\n  As DNI, the Ambassador will have to work diligently to ensure that \nsignals intelligence and other technical collection means are \ncontinuously updated, expanded, and modified to not only provide \nstrategic intelligence but also actionable information for our war \nfighters--something in which I am personally most interested.\n  Our intelligence community is home to some of the world's finest \nminds which have averted disaster and provided the highest quality \ninformation to consumers from the President down to the privates on the \nfront line. However, inferential analysis and ``group think'' are \npractices against which the DNI must guard. The DNI must ensure that \nrigorously competitive analysis models and improved analytics \ntradecraft be implemented.\n  The problem of inaccurate information sharing amongst agencies has \nbeen a recurring theme during the review of the Senate Select Committee \non Intelligence of our recent intelligence failures leading to 9/11 and \nU.S. assessments of Iraq WMD programs. We have seen, unfortunately, \neven since 9/11, far too recent incidents where agencies working on \ncommon problems did not share that information and those sources. In \nthis day, that is totally unacceptable. The DNI will not only face the \nchallenge of ensuring that information is passed up and down the chain \nof command, but that colleagues working for different agencies within \nthe intelligence community can and do regularly share and exchange \ninformation and ideas.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, under the wise, \ncompassionate guidance of Chairman Roberts, has espoused the idea of \nnot merely information sharing but of information access. It is a \ndifficult task. Sensitive information must be protected from \ndisclosure, and too often protecting it from disclosure means not \nsharing it with people who are working on the same project. \nNonetheless, the Ambassador has assured me that an analyst with a need \nto know will have access to the information, regardless of who collects \nit and who is working on it.\n  In the end, no matter what means is used to collect intelligence, it \nis the fine, brave, and dedicated men and women of the intelligence \ncommunity who will make it work on any given day on the ground. It will \nbe not only a responsibility but a duty of the DNI to ensure that these \nmen and women receive the proper education and training to discharge \ntheir duties. While substantive expertise and technical prowess are \nessential, leadership and management training, along with mentorship \nprograms are key elements that will ensure that we attract, as well as \nretain, the talented, motivated, and dedicated personnel we need.\n  The men and women of the intelligence community are our first \ntripwire to help stave off disaster. They can advise us on prudent \ncourses of action to advance our national security interests. They \nwillingly take great risks and make great sacrifices daily. \nAccordingly, it is the solemn obligation of the DNI to ensure their \nranks continue to be filled with competent visionaries, managers, and \ninnovators who are willing to lead and care for them.\n  Over the years, this body has seen and even drafted recommendations \nto establish a DNI and/or a more accountable and powerful chief of our \nintelligence community. While the establishment of a DNI is historic, \nit was not established to the degree of budgetary and other powers that \nI, along with several of my colleagues, would have liked and thought \nwould be very necessary. So the Ambassador will face challenges as he \nasserts his authority over the 15 intelligence agencies he will \nsupervise. I hope he will use the implied powers of this position and \nthe positive enforcement and support of the President to make sure the \nwork that needs to be done is done and the DNI will have the power \nthat, unfortunately, he was not given in the legislation but we believe \nhe must exercise.\n  Reflecting on the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and the WMD \nCommission, as well as many pre-9/11 studies, and the work that has \ngone on in the Select Committee on Intelligence, I fully endorse and \ncall on my colleagues to support Ambassador Negroponte as he \nestablishes these powers to make sure our homeland is protected and our \npolicymakers and warfighters on the ground are well informed.\n  Having met with Ambassador Negroponte at length and being well aware \nof his qualifications, I am confident he will not only meet these high \nstandards but will set a fine precedent for all succeeding DNIs to \nfollow.\n  I ask my colleagues to act quickly to confirm Ambassador Negroponte \nto lead our intelligence community so he may begin in earnest to make \nthe difficult changes we believe are sorely needed.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank the managers of this nomination, and I \nurge prompt confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, I wish to make a few comments both about Ambassador John \nNegroponte and also LTG Michael Hayden. He is soon to be General \nHayden, I understand.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator allow me to yield to her such time \nas she may desire?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I certainly will. I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I know General Hayden will be a four-star general very shortly. I \nthink that is very good news. So we will have the first Director and \nPrincipal Deputy Director of National Intelligence.\n  I believe these are both excellent nominees. They will provide strong \nnew overall management and leadership to the intelligence community as \nit finally adapts to post-Cold War realities.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has served with distinction, both in Washington \nand around the globe. He served as United States Ambassador to four \nnations and to the United Nations. As Deputy National Security Adviser, \nAmbassador Negroponte was intimately involved in the formation and use \nof intelligence. He is well suited to overseeing the collection of \nvital intelligence needed for the United States to protect itself. \nAmbassador Negroponte comes to this new position without strong ties or \nbias to any specific intelligence agency. That is an enormous strength, \nand I believe he will be an honest broker and manager for the \ncommunity. He has pledged that he will be a neutral and apolitical \nprovider of intelligence to Government policymakers.\n  Although General Hayden's nomination is not before us at this time, I \nwish to say I hold him in the highest regard. He is a skilled manager \nand an expert in the workings of our Nation's intelligence apparatus. \nGeneral Hayden led a remarkable turnaround of an enormously complex and \ntechnical agency, the National Security Agency. He was first made \nDirector of the NSA under President Clinton and has had his tour \nextended three times by President Bush. That is a true testament to his \nleadership. He has proven his ability to establish a skilled and \ndedicated workforce. In short, General Hayden is a strong choice to be \nthe day-to-day manager of the intelligence community.\n  Both men have the strength, the vision, and the determination that is \nnecessary to be successful in their new positions.\n  As my colleagues know, I introduced legislation to create a DNI in \nthe 107th Congress and again in the 108th Congress. So I was pleased to \nsee that with the support of the 9/11 Commission and the chairs and \nranking members of the Intelligence and Governmental Affairs \nCommittees, this position was finally established.\n  As Director and Deputy Director of National Intelligence, these \nappointees face daunting challenges. The 15 intelligence agencies are a \ncommunity in name only. The fiefdoms and turf battles--the stovepipes--\nbetween agencies may have lessened since September 11, but they \ncontinue to hinder our intelligence operations.\n  Our technical means for collecting intelligence must be adapted to \nthis new nonstate terrorist world and its challenges. The acquisition \nand development of new intelligence systems need better management.\n  The demands for better human intelligence are well documented by \nreports, including the Congressional Joint Inquiry, our Intelligence \nCommittee's Iraq study, the 9/11 Commission, and the President's own \nWMD Commission. Each of these reports\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\nspells out, in stark terms, the organizational, the leadership, and the \ncapability challenges that await Director Negroponte and General \nHayden.\n  The U.S. intelligence estimates of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \nwere, as the WMD Commission stated, ``dead wrong'' before the war. \nThere was a lack of solid intelligence, made worse by fundamental and \ninexcusable lapses in tradecraft and judgment. The systematic failings \nwill take sustained leadership and vigorous oversight to correct.\n  Our intelligence capabilities in other crucial areas--Iran and North \nKorea among them--are still inadequate and unacceptable. As the war and \npostwar operations in Iraq show dramatically and tragically, we cannot \ngovern effectively and cannot make informed decisions without timely \nand accurate intelligence. We cannot afford to fail again. The stakes \nare very large, indeed.\n  Thankfully, the recent Commission and Senate reports have also made \nimportant recommendations. Both Ambassador Negroponte and General \nHayden have expressed willingness to make important changes. They will \ntake steps to integrate and bolster intelligence collection and to end \n``group think'' and untested assumptions. They will use red teams and \nalternative analysis when intelligence conflicts. This was a \nsubstantial lacking that led to the wrong judgments made in the Iraq \nNational Intelligence Estimate that so many of us relied upon to make \nour judgment on how to vote to authorize the President with use of \nforce in Iraq.\n  The Director also has the authority to put in place a management team \nand implement changes, including new mission managers and new centers, \nto focus attention on the most pressing problems.\n  I believe strongly it is going to take a strong and authoritative \nDirector of National Intelligence to put our intelligence community \nback on the right track. Equally important, it will take forthright and \nimpeccably objective leaders to restore the credibility both to the \nAmerican people and to the world that was destroyed by the assessments \nof Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.\n  The legislation that created the DNI last year, the Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act, spells out the framework for a \nstrong DNI, but it did not fill in the details. The authorities and \nresponsibilities that should have been made clear in law, I believe, \nwill have to be instead established in practice. I have discussed \nprivately and through the confirmation hearing process with Ambassador \nNegroponte the need for him to assert authority by taking bold action \nto lead and manage the intelligence community, and I will support him \nin doing so.\n  I have confidence the new Director shares this vision and will take \nthe necessary steps immediately after taking office. General Hayden, \nwith his experience in fighting these battles as Director of NSA, will \nbe a key adviser and ally in fulfilling this charge.\n  The men and women who work for the 15 intelligence agencies are \nskilled and dedicated, but they need innovative, new tools and ways of \ndoing business to meet our future strategic intelligence needs. I am \nconfident that Director Negroponte and Deputy Director Hayden will work \nto provide these needs.\n  I thank the President for forwarding such skilled, nonpartisan \nnominees, and I wholeheartedly support their confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am delighted to yield 10 minutes to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee whose unflagging, untiring, persevering efforts, \nalong with her coauthor, Senator Lieberman, led to passage of the \nIntelligence Reform Act that has returned us to this whole process \nwhere we have Ambassador Negroponte and General Hayden, an outstanding \nteam, not only to reform but to lead the intelligence community.\n  I thank the Senator for her leadership and her efforts. She \npersevered, and she was successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Intelligence Committee and his extraordinary ranking \nmember for all their work to improve the quality of the intelligence \nupon which our policymakers, our men and women who are on the front \nlines, and all of us rely.\n  Last July, the Senate leaders assigned the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee the task of developing legislation to \nimplement the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission. The committee I \nam privileged to chair devoted more than 5 months to this important and \ncomplex issue that is so crucial to the safety and well-being of the \nAmerican people. We successfully accomplished our assignment with the \nenactment of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of \n2004, which the President signed into law in December.\n  During the committee's inquiry into how to fix the flaws in our \nNation's intelligence capability that permitted so many dots to go \nunconnected for so long, one remedy emerged as being among the very \nhighest priorities. Our intelligence community--15 disparate agencies \nand entities, each with its own expertise and experience--clearly \nneeded one leader. The role of this leader has often been described as \nthat of a CEO in business, a person with the ultimate authority over \nthe operation and with the ultimate accountability for results. An even \nmore succinct description was offered by former Secretary of State \nPowell at one of our committee's many hearings. He said what the \nintelligence community really needed was an empowered quarterback.\n  The new law creates the Director of National Intelligence as that \nempowered quarterback, with significant authority to manage the \nintelligence community and to transform it into, to use President \nBush's term, a single unified enterprise.\n  I believe John Negroponte is the right person, the right leader to be \nthat CEO, that empowered quarterback.\n  Ambassador Negroponte is an accomplished diplomat, which is a vital \ncredential in the international war against terrorism. Having served \nvery recently as our Ambassador in Iraq, he knows firsthand how \nimportant the intelligence provided is. He has been an intelligence \nconsumer. Throughout his distinguished and varied career in service to \nour country, he has demonstrated strong, decisive leadership skills. \nThese skills will be invaluable in exercising the Director of National \nIntelligence authorities and in carrying out the intelligence community \ntransformation called for in our legislation.\n  The Ambassador's extensive experience in national security and \nforeign relations is a solid foundation for the weighty \nresponsibilities he will have in this critical position. As the first \nDNI, Ambassador Negroponte will not only serve a critical role \nimmediately, he will also establish the relationships and set the \nprecedent for future DNIs. Thus, when I met with the Ambassador, I \nencouraged him to aggressively use the authorities we worked so hard to \nsecure in the intelligence reform bill. One of those key authorities \nconcerns the DNI's responsibility for determining the budget for the \nnational intelligence program. He also will have significant authority \nto execute that budget and to transfer funds, if needed, to meet \nemerging threats and the greatest priorities.\n  Today, at a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on the \nnomination of General Hayden to be the No. 2 person to the DNI, I \nraised the issue with General Hayden about the need to aggressively \nexercise that budget authority. The law is very clear on this point, \nbut already we have seen some signs from the Defense Department of a \npotential challenge to the new DNI in exercising that authority.\n  I think it should be very clear, through the legislative history and \nin our conversations today, that the DNI has a direct relationship to \nthe heads of the National Security Agency and the other intelligence \nagencies that are housed within the Pentagon but serve not only the \nDepartment of Defense but all intelligence consumers. I was pleased to \nhear General Hayden's understanding of the extent of that authority.\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\n  Ambassador Negroponte will be the first intelligence CEO to set the \ncommunity's budget, to establish community-wide intelligence gathering \nand analytical priorities, and to employ financial, technological, and \nhuman resources where and when they are most needed, or, as Secretary \nPowell might have put it, he will be calling the plays. This is an \nunprecedented challenge and unprecedented authority, and I am convinced \nJohn Negroponte will meet this challenge in an exemplary manner. I am \nconvinced he understands the need to exercise that authority to the \nfull extent of the law.\n  Ambassador Negroponte will provide our intelligence community with \naccomplished, experienced, dedicated, and needed leadership. I \nwholeheartedly urge my colleagues to approve this important nomination \nwithout any delay. Again, I commend the chairman and the ranking member \nfor bringing this nominee so quickly to the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is not easy for a member of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence to oppose Ambassador Negroponte's \nnomination on the floor of this Senate. I am well aware that many do \nnot share the concerns, and the views I will express this afternoon \nhave not been arrived at casually.\n  The Ambassador is the consummate diplomat, a dedicated public \nservant, a well-liked person who is popular with Members of the Senate \nof both political parties. He has been confirmed by the Senate for a \nvariety of posts. I have voted twice for those confirmations, but I am \nnot convinced that Ambassador Negroponte is the right man for this job. \nI have reached this judgment based on my strong belief that a \nprerequisite for this position should be a willingness to be direct and \nforthcoming with policymakers even when the truth is difficult. \nUnfortunately, directness was nowhere in sight in the Ambassador's \nresponses at his confirmation hearing last week.\n  At that hearing, the Ambassador was not even as direct and \nforthcoming in discussing controversial matters as he has been in the \npast. For example, at the hearing I discussed with the Ambassador his \nservice in Honduras. I made it clear at the outset that I understand it \nmakes no sense to relitigate a war that took place in Central America \nmore than 20 years ago. In spite of the lengthy news accounts printed \nthat morning, the morning of his confirmation hearing, providing new \ninformation documenting the Ambassador's continued backing of the \nContras after the House had voted to halt U.S. support, I chose not to \nfocus on those issues. I raised the Honduras issue last week and return \nto it this afternoon because I believe the record of the Ambassador's \nservice there is particularly telling in terms of his judgment and his \nwillingness to confront difficult facts, which I believe are two key \nrequirements for the Director of National Intelligence.\n\n  For example, I find it especially troubling that the Ambassador's \nperception of the human rights situation in Honduras differs so \ndramatically from that expressed by the Central Intelligence Agency, \nthe InterAmerican Court, the Honduras Human Rights Commission, and \nothers. The Central Intelligence Agency released a report entitled \n``Selected Issues Relating to CIA Activities in Honduras in the 1980s'' \nwhich found:\n\n       Honduran military committed hundreds of human rights abuses \n     since 1980, many of which were politically motivated and \n     officially sanctioned.\n\n  The CIA report linked the Honduran military personnel to death squad \nactivities.\n  Mr. Negroponte, on the other hand, said in a September 12, 1982, \nletter that was printed in the New York Times Magazine that:\n\n       Honduras's increasingly professional armed forces are \n     dedicated to defending the sovereignty and territorial \n     integrity of the country, and they are publicly committed to \n     civilian constitutional rule.\n\n  The InterAmerican Court for Human Rights heard cases concerning human \nrights abuses in Honduras. In 1989, the Court found:\n\n       A practice of disappearances carried out or tolerated by \n     Honduran officials existed between 1981 and 1984; and\n       The Government of Honduras failed to guarantee the human \n     rights affected by that practice.\n\n  In an October 23, 1982, letter printed in the Economist, Ambassador \nNegroponte wrote:\n\n       Honduras's increasingly professional armed forces are fully \n     supportive of this country's constitutional system.\n\n  The Honduran Human Rights Commissioner released a report on forced \ndisappearances that occurred in Honduras during Ambassador Negroponte's \ntenure. The report states:\n\n       [t]here existed within the Armed Forces a deliberate policy \n     of kidnapping and forcibly disappearing persons.\n\n  Yet the introductory passage of the 1983 State Department Country \nReport issued while Mr. Negroponte was Ambassador stated:\n\n       The Honduran military, which ruled the country for almost \n     20 years before 1982, supports the present civilian \n     government and is publicly committed to national and local \n     elections, which are scheduled in 1985, as well as the \n     observance of human rights.\n\n  The fact is, when you read what the Ambassador has said about \nHonduras, and what the CIA and others have said about the same time \nperiod, it is as if John Negroponte was an ambassador to a different \ncountry.\n  Given these sharp differences, I asked the Ambassador last week to \nreconcile this very large gap between what he saw and what others \nreported. I expected an answer that would have at least acknowledged \nthese very substantial differences and indicated that in hindsight the \nAmbassador would have been more outspoken about human rights practices.\n  Instead, the Ambassador tried to dismiss the issue altogether by \nsimply saying the differences were not so great, something I thought \nwas pretty hard to fathom, given the accounts I had provided to him.\n  The fact is, in trying to brush off this issue of Honduras, the \nAmbassador actually showed less candor last week than he has in the \npast. For instance, at his 2003 hearing before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee when he was being considered for Ambassador to the United \nNations, Mr. Negroponte stated the following about Honduran human \nrights abuses:\n\n       Maybe it was a mixed picture, Senator. I am more than \n     willing to acknowledge that.\n\n  At the same hearing he said:\n\n       Could I have been more vocal? Well, you know, in \n     retrospect, perhaps I could have been.\n\n  So you have to ask, as I have done, Why would the Ambassador be less \ndirect last week than he had been previously? Certainly there was no \nnational security reason for him to duck questions about events that \nare decades old. Perhaps the newspaper articles that morning made him \nfear Congress would get into issues he might find uncomfortable. That \nis certainly understandable, but it is absolutely unacceptable for a \nnominee tapped to head our Nation's intelligence community at a time \nwhen directness and forthrightness is more important than ever before. \nThroughout his confirmation hearing, on issue after issue, the \nAmbassador ducked and avoided giving anything resembling a \nstraightforward answer.\n  I asked the Ambassador whether he foresaw his office involving itself \nin decisions relating to the implementation of the PATRIOT Act's \nsurveillance powers, and in particular whether his office might weigh \nin on whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation should seek a FISC \nwarrant.\n  His answer?\n\n       Senator, I am not entirely certain what my authorities \n     would be under FISC.\n\n  I asked the Ambassador whether he would be willing to take a fresh \nlook at the United States rendition policy, possibly the most \ncontroversial weapon being used in fighting terrorism today. Rendition \ninvolves sending a suspected terrorist from one country to another \nwithout court proceedings. Republican and Democratic administrations \nhave used renditions in the past, but their use has increased \nsignificantly since 9/11, and the policy has certainly changed. \nPreviously, most suspects were rendered to the United States. Now it \nworks the opposite way. More and more often the United States is \nrendering suspects to foreign countries. News reports indicate that \nsuspects are frequently being rendered to countries known to torture \nsuspected terrorists, such as Syria, Egypt, Uzbekistan, and Saudi \nArabia. While the United States gets assurances from foreign \ngovernments they will not use torture, U.S.\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nofficials have little control over the situation once a suspect is in \nthe hands of the foreign country.\n  Rendition is the practice used to address a very difficult dilemma. \nAmerica may lack the evidence to bring a suspected terrorist into \ncourt; there is some proof of wrongdoing, but not enough for a court of \nlaw. If the suspect is not an American citizen, it is possible to send \nthem elsewhere to be dealt with, but that can be a dicey prospect. \nRenditions get suspects off the streets, something which makes \nAmericans safer. But the tactic has raised serious concerns for many of \nour citizens and for many people in other countries as well. I have \nheard those concerns, but I also recognize that renditions can serve a \nlegitimate and valuable purpose. It is a question of how this policy is \ncarried out. Our country needs to have a frank and candid and direct \ndiscussion about this policy of rendition. But, before that can happen, \nthere needs to be some answers to some tough questions:\n  Have any suspects been rendered based on faulty intelligence and, if \nso, what amount of intelligence should be necessary before a rendition \ntakes place?\n  Are there certain countries to which the United States should not \nrender suspects?\n  Are the assurances the United States gets in the rendition area \nsufficient with regard to the use of torture?\n  Does the United States need to retain more control of suspects it \nrenders, especially to countries that have weak human rights records?\n  How good is the intelligence the United States is getting from \nrendered suspects?\n\n  What is the effect of a rendition policy on America's diplomatic \nrelations with other countries?\n  These are some of the important questions that need to be answered. \nSo in an effort to examine Ambassador Negroponte's openness and to try \nto determine his judgment in a difficult area such as this, I asked the \nAmbassador whether he would be willing to take a fresh look at our \nrendition policy; not a point-by-point description of what he would do, \nbut simply would he be willing to take a fresh look, a new inspection \nof this country's approach in rendition.\n  The Los Angeles Times summed up the Ambassador's response to my \nquestion about rendition with four words. They said: ``Negroponte \navoided the question.''\n  The Ambassador, I would point out, ducked other important questions \nasked by members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. For \nexample, our colleague from Michigan, Senator Levin, asked the \nAmbassador to explain what action he would take if the Ambassador \nconcluded policymakers were making public statements that differed from \nthe classified intelligence. There was no direct answer to that \nimportant question asked by Senator Levin.\n  Senator Feinstein sought detailed information on how, with regard to \ncountries such as Iran and North Korea, the Ambassador intended to \nassure the United States developed much needed credible intelligence. \nAmbassador Negroponte responded:\n\n       Well, Senator, the law prescribes a number of approaches to \n     this.\n\n  Then I asked the Ambassador about the issue of overclassification of \nmaterial in the area of national security. This is an issue that has \nconcerned many in the Senate, of both political parties. I have been \ninterested in this matter for some time.\n  I was, frankly, flabbergasted when\n9/11 Commissioner Tom Kean, who did such a superb job in his work, with \nLee Hamilton, former Member of the other body--Tom Kean said 75 percent \nof everything he saw when he chaired the\n9/11 Commission that was classified should not have been classified. \nThis is what Tom Kean said in the extraordinarily important inquiry he \nconducted.\n  The Central Intelligence Agency initially blacked out over 50 percent \nof the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Report on Iraq's WMD \nprograms and links to terrorist groups.\n  I will tell colleagues I thought Chairman Roberts and Senator \nRockefeller did a superb job in guiding our committee to a unanimous \njudgment with respect to Iraq and that important report. But if the CIA \nhad had its way, page after page after page would have been blacked \nout.\n  The National Archives Information Security Office reported 14.2 \nmillion classification actions in 2003, twice the number recorded 10 \nyears earlier. The agencies are becoming more creative in terms of how \nthey overclassify. In addition to the traditional ``limited official \nuse,'' ``secret'' and ``top secret,'' some agencies now have \n``sensitive security information,'' ``sensitive Homeland Security \ninformation,'' ``sensitive but unclassified'' and ``for official use \nonly'' classifications, as well.\n  Secrecy has become so pervasive it makes you wonder whether facts are \nbeing classified for legitimate reasons or to protect the individuals \nand agencies involved.\n  As I mentioned, this has been a bipartisan concern. I am particularly \ngrateful for the work Senator Lott has been willing to do with me. We \ntook some modest steps in the intelligence reform bill to open this \nprocess and try to bring some balance back into the area of \nclassification. But given this history, given the huge explosion in \nterms of overclassification of Government documents, I was interested \nin what the Ambassador had to say with respect to this.\n  When I first asked, he said:\n\n       Senator, I don't know about classification or \n     overclassification.\n\n  But then he went on to make the mind-boggling claim that ``Certainly \nthe trend in my lifetime has been to reduce levels of classification \nwherever possible. And I've seen that happen before my own eyes.''\n  Troubling as that answer was and the nonanswers that I received to \nthe other important questions I asked with respect to the PATRIOT Act \nand relating to rendition and other topics, as troubling as what I was \ntold and wasn't told, is it is not only what the Director of National \nIntelligence will know that is so important but what he is willing to \nsay that is vital.\n  In spite of the Ambassador's responses to these questions, I have no \nquestion in my mind of Ambassador Negroponte's ability to master the \nfacts. What I am not confident of is his steadfast commitment to \nspeaking those facts to ears that do not want to hear them. And history \ntells us the consequences of an inability or an unwillingness to speak \ntruth to power can be disastrous.\n  This country saw what happened in the Bay of Pigs, an unsuccessful \nattempt by United States-backed Cuban exiles to overthrow the \nGovernment of the Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. It is a classic example \nof what can happen when America's intelligence community is unwilling \nor unable to be candid. In his review of the Bay of Pigs invasion \nrelease to the public in 1998, CIA Inspector General Lyman Kirkpatrick \nidentified numerous failures. These include:\n\n       [The f]ailure to subject the president, especially in its \n     latter frenzied stages, to a cold and objective appraisal by \n     the best operating talent available, particularly by those \n     not involved in the operation, such as the Chief of \n     Operations and the chiefs of the Senior Staffs;\n       [The f]ailure to advise the president, at an appropriate \n     time, that success has become dubious and to recommend the \n     operation be, therefore, canceled and that the problem of \n     unseating Castro be restudied;\n       The failure to maintain the covert nature of the project--\n     ``[f]or more than three months before the invasion the \n     American press was reporting, often with some accuracy, on \n     the recruiting and training of Cubans. Such massive \n     preparations could only be laid to the U.S. The agency's name \n     was freely linked with these activities. Plausible denial was \n     a pathetic illusion.''\n\n  This is what the inspector general said. This is not what a partisan \nsaid. Yet the CIA unrealistically plowed ahead, unwilling or unable to \nface the reality of the situation that the operation was doomed to \nfail, and as a result the CIA was humiliated, many died, our prestige \nwas damaged.\n  Throughout the entire time our country was in Vietnam the \nintelligence community also failed to be forthright and was plagued by \noveroptimism. One example was particularly worth noting.\n  In 1963, the Board of National Estimate's draft Nation Intelligence \nEstimate concluded that ``The struggle in South Vietnam at best will be \nprotracted and costly [because] very great weaknesses remain and will \nbe difficult to surmount.''\n  Unhappy with the pessimistic conclusion, the Director of Central \nIntelligence John McCone rejected the draft\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\nand instructed the board to seek the views of senior policymakers in \nrevising the Nation's Intelligence Estimate.\n  So the final version of the 1963 stated:\n\n       We believe that Communist progress has been blunted and \n     that the situation is improving . . .\n\n  As those who put together the Pentagon papers later observed:\n\n       The intelligence and reporting problems occurring during \n     this period cannot be explained away . . . In retrospect [the \n     estimators] were not only wrong, but more importantly, they \n     were influential. As a result, a generation paid the price \n     for the unwillingness or the inability of the intelligence \n     community's inability to be forthright.\n\n  Now our country deals with those consequences.\n  Many in the Senate will remember George Tenet told the President of \nthe United States that the weapons of mass destruction case against \nIraq was a ``slam dunk.'' Now America knows what George Tenet knew and \nwhat he was unwilling or unable to tell the President of the United \nStates, that it wasn't a slam dunk at all.\n  The Niger yellowcake, the high-strength aluminum, the mobile weapons \nlab, the aerial vehicles, the intelligence provided by Curveball and \nthe Iraqi National Congress witnesses, all of this intelligence was \nquestionable and was being questioned by at least some members of the \nintelligence community.\n  However, George Tenet was not direct. He was not forthcoming. He told \nthe President of the United States what the President wanted to hear. \nWhether he was unwilling or unable to be straight with the President, I \ncannot possibly determine. What I do know is that as a member of the \nSelect Committee on Intelligence I want to do everything I can. I know \nevery Member of the Senate wants to make sure these mistakes are not \nrepeated. The stakes are simply too high.\n  The Intelligence Reorganization Act gave the Director of National \nIntelligence a whole lot of responsibility but very little enforcement \npower. As the Director works to make 15 intelligence agencies pull \ntogether, his credibility will be his currency. Critical to his success \nwill be the understanding of all concerned that this person is going to \nbe direct, that the person will be forthcoming, that the person will \nmake sure that no matter who the truth hurts, no matter what \npolicymakers think, they are going to get the facts.\n  Here is what I think the country needs. The United States needs a \nDirector of National Intelligence who is going to speak truth to power, \nsomebody who has, in Hamilton's words, the ``gumption'' to tell the \nPresident and other senior policymakers what they don't want to hear.\n  The United States needs a Director of National Intelligence who has \nthe knowledge and the experience to step in and begin fixing the \nproblems facing the intelligence sector immediately.\n  The United States needs a Director of National Intelligence who will \nbreak down existing walls inhibiting analysts throughout the \nintelligence community and, when appropriate, officials and citizens \noutside that realm from getting access to the information they need to \nkeep Americans safe. The United States needs a Director of National \nIntelligence willing to, when necessary, go head to head with the \nagencies under his control, especially the Department of Defense. If \nthe Director lets them push him around, he is doomed.\n\n  The United States needs a Director of National Intelligence to take \ncontrol over the intelligence budget. Before Congress created the \nposition, the intelligence community lacked a leader willing to make \ntough budget priority and tradeoff decisions. Each agency asked for \nfunds. It was, in effect, a matter of passing the request along. This \nhas to stop. There are not limitless resources. A strategic view, not a \nparochial lens, ought to be guiding budget decisions.\n  The United States needs a Director of National Intelligence to shape \nthe intelligence agencies he oversees into a true community because, at \nthis point, the phrase ``intelligence community'' is pretty much a \nmisnomer. While coordination and cooperation have improved, the \nindividual intelligence agencies persist in maintaining their own \nculture and collection practices. As the military services have learned \nto fight jointly, our intelligence collection agencies need to learn \nhow to act together to gather critical information our policymakers and \nwarfighters need to protect our country.\n  The United States needs a Director of National Intelligence who \nrecognizes he cannot do this alone. This position is new and its \nauthority, while substantial, is unclear. His fights with the \nadministration over matters of significant national policy need not, \nand should not, always be kept quiet. If the Director of National \nIntelligence is to succeed, he will need to look to allies in the \nexecutive branch and here in the Congress to help.\n  While Ambassador Negroponte is surely a skilled diplomat and has many \nallies in the Senate, Senators of both parties I admire greatly, I am \nnot confident the administration's nominee will meet these \nexpectations.\n  For that reason, I will be voting no on the nomination of Ambassador \nJohn Negroponte to be Director of National Intelligence.\n  Mr. President, I want to wrap up with one additional point. I am \npleased to be in strong support of General Hayden, who will, when the \nnominee is confirmed, be the deputy. I thought General Hayden's \ndirectness and openness at his confirmation hearing was particularly \nwelcome.\n  For example, I asked him, on the matter of privacy rights, which is \npretty important, given his past background at the NSA, how he would \nhandle that issue. I think there was a sense it is possible to fight \nterrorism ferociously while still protecting civil liberties. General \nHayden, in contrast to what we heard at the earlier confirmation \nhearing, was refreshingly direct in his responses, where he talked \nabout pushing right up to the line--I believe those were his exact \nwords--but being sensitive to civil liberties.\n  So I am pleased to be able to say, on the floor of the Senate, I am \nlooking forward to the support General Hayden will be receiving from \nthe Senate shortly. I expect Ambassador Negroponte and General Hayden \nto be approved. My door will be open to both of them. As a member of \nthe Intelligence Committee, it is my hope that both of these \nindividuals will not hesitate to ask me and ask colleagues for help. \nThe safety of our country depends on the performance of these two \nindividuals in this key post.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side of \nthe aisle?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia has 32 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, which will be less than that.\n  Mr. President, I am going to use this opportunity to speak on an \nunrelated issue, not entirely but somewhat, but one that is of critical \nimportance to the intelligence community and the American people.\n  Last week, I filed an amendment to the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. Unfortunately, I was not able to bring the \namendment before the Senate because it was not germane under \npostcloture rules. This amendment is important enough, however, that I \nwill take just a few minutes to explain it.\n  My amendment was, and is, simple and straightforward. It expresses \nthe sense of the Senate. It is not directive. It expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence should \nconduct an investigation into matters related to the collection of \nintelligence through the detention, interrogation, and rendition of \nprisoners. That is its purpose.\n  The amendment, as I indicated, does not direct the committee to \nundertake this much needed and long overdue congressional review. \nRather, it is a statement by the Senate that the committee should carry \nout its oversight duties and carefully, thoroughly, and constructively \nevaluate the interrogation practices of the U.S. Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  A year has passed since the appearance of photographs graphically \nportraying the abuse of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison. Since \nthen, we have\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nseen a steady stream of accusations relating to the way U.S. military \nand intelligence agencies treat individuals in their custody. \nAllegations of mistreatment have surfaced wherever the United States \nholds prisoners overseas--across Iraq, in Afghanistan, and at \nGuantanamo Bay.\n  Troubling new revelations have become almost a daily occurrence--\nliterally a daily occurrence--with a disturbing number of these \nincidents resulting in prisoner deaths.\n  At least 26 prisoners have died in American custody. The disturbing \ncharge has been leveled against the United States that we are exporting \ntorture through rendition practices that lack accountability.\n  Who can honestly say these events and allegations are not serious \nenough to warrant an Intelligence Committee investigation?\n  The collection of intelligence through interrogation and rendition is \nan extremely important part of our counterterrorism effort and one of \nour most important intelligence tools.\n  But this tool, as with all others, must be applied within the bounds \nof our laws and our own moral framework. It must be subject to the same \nscrutiny and congressional oversight as every other aspect of \nintelligence collection. This, unfortunately, has not been the case.\n  Despite the critical importance of interrogation-derived intelligence \nand the growing controversy surrounding detention, interrogation, and \nrendition practices and policies, the Congress has largely ignored the \nissue, holding few hearings that have provided only limited insight.\n  More disturbingly, in this Senator's judgment, the Senate \nIntelligence Committee--the committee charged with overseeing \nintelligence programs, and the only committee with the jurisdiction to \ninvestigate all aspects of this issue--is, in this Senator's judgment, \nsitting on the sidelines and effectively abdicating its oversight \nresponsibility to media investigative reporters who go at it very \naggressively and on a daily basis.\n  As the Intelligence Committee's vice chairman, I have been pushing, \nfor the past 3 months, for an investigation into the legal and \noperational questions at the heart of the detention and interrogation \ncontroversy.\n  My requests, and those of other committee members, have been \nrebuffed, based upon the argument that we have been fully informed on \nthe particulars of our detention and interrogation program, and the \nIntelligence Committee need only monitor these operations.\n  The point has also been made that the Intelligence Committee should \nnot undertake an investigation into these issues because the CIA \nInspector General is conducting his own investigation. I reject this \nnotion that the Senate should cede to the executive branch its \noversight responsibilities. Carrying out oversight is why the Senate \nIntelligence Committee exists.\n  Effective congressional oversight is not achieved passively waiting \nfor and accepting the parameters of internal executive branch reviews. \nWe are separate in our responsibilities, executive and legislative. \nWhile it is true that the CIA inspector general is investigating \nspecific allegations of abuse involving intelligence personnel, those \nspecific cases represent a small portion of what the Intelligence \nCommittee should be examining. Many fundamental legal and operational \nissues are outside the inspector general's very limited focus and \ndeserve the Intelligence Committee's immediate attention.\n  We have a duty to not simply monitor but to actively inquire about \nthe conduct of congressionally funded activities--that is our job--\nespecially activities such as prisoner interrogation that can have life \nor death implications. Down the road, if we don't set these rules \nstraight, that can come back to haunt our soldiers and their safety.\n  Up to this point, the Intelligence Committee oversight that I am \nspeaking of has been, in the judgment of this Senator, abdicated to the \npress over the past year. Here is a sampling, which I will go through \nquickly, of headlines from articles that have been published in recent \nweeks: ``Interrogator Says U.S. Approved Handling of Detainee Who \nDied''; ``White House Has Tightly Restricted Oversight of CIA \nDetentions''; ``FBI Report Questions Guantanamo Tactics''; ``Questions \nAre Left by C.I.A. Chief on the Use of Torture''; ``CIA's Assurances on \nTransferred Subjects Doubted--Prisoners Say Countries Break No-Torture \nPledges''; ``Europeans Investigate CIA Role in Abductions''; ``Army \nDetails Scale of Abuse of Prisoners in an Afghan Jail''; ``Prisoners at \nAbu Ghraib Said to Include Children''; ``Army, CIA Agreed on `Ghost' \nPrisoners''; ``Lack of Oversight Led to the Abuse of Detainees, \nInvestigator Says''; ``Ex-CIA Lawyer Calls for Law on Rendition''; \n``CIA Avoids Scrutiny of Detainee Treatment''; ``Files Show New Abuse \nCases in Afghan and Iraqi Prisons''; ``CIA Is Seeking New Role on \nDetainees''; ``FBI Agents Allege Abuse of Detainees at Guantanamo \nBay''; ``CIA Was Wary of U.S. Interrogation Methods in Iraq.''\n  I think the Presiding Officer gets the drift.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider the finding made by General Fay in \nhis recent report on the abuses at Abu Ghraib. General Fay found that \nCIA practices ``led to a loss of accountability, abuse . . . and the \nunhealthy mystique that further poisoned the atmosphere at Abu \nGhraib.''\n  General Fay was unable to fully investigate the CIA's role at Abu \nGhraib and other prisons. The Senate Intelligence Committee, however, \nis not unable to do that. That is our job.\n  These and other reports highlight the need for the sort of strong \ncongressional oversight that in my judgment is now absent. There are \nmany legal and operational questions that we should be investigating to \nensure that this vitally important intelligence collection program is \nnot continually hampered by vague and confusing legal and operational \ndirectives.\n  For example, on March 18, 2005, the Central Intelligence Agency \nissued a statement that:\n\n       CIA policies on interrogation have always followed legal \n     guidance from the Department of Justice.\n\n  That may be so, but was that legal guidance supportable? A lengthy \nlegal opinion of the Department of Justice on interrogation practices, \nwhich had been issued in secret in August 2002, was quickly repudiated \nby the White House when it became public in June of 2004 and was \nsuperseded by a public Justice Department legal opinion in December of \n2004. As that episode indicates, secret law is an invitation to great \nerror.\n  The Intelligence Committee, which includes members of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, must conduct a complete examination of the legal \nguidance that CIA and Defense Department interrogators have been given. \nWhat supporting roles do the CIA and FBI play in the interrogation of \nsuspects at military-run institutions? And how are their activities \ncoordinated, if they are?\n  It has been publicly reported that the CIA requested that a number of \nprisoners held in Iraq not be registered and be kept from international \ninspection--so-called ghost detainees--and that FBI officials lodged \nstrenuous complaints about the mistreatment of prisoners held at \nGuantanamo Bay. I cannot emphasize how strongly those FBI objections \nwere. These reports and others strongly suggest that different agencies \nare operating by different sets of interrogation and detention rules, \nwhich is a recipe for disaster.\n  The Congress should evaluate the general policy guidelines for which \nit is appropriate to render a detainee to another country, and what \nintelligence is gained from such practice.\n  More specifically, we must examine the validity of assurances that \nthe United States is given when detainees are rendered to other \ncountries that they will not be tortured. The Congress should \nundertake, with the intelligence community, case studies of \ninterrogations, including the methods used and, importantly, the \nreliability of the information obtained. As with other intelligence \ntools, we should consider on the basis of facts, rather than surmise, \nwhat works, what does not work, to obtain reliable information that \nactually contributes to our national security. The Congress should \nexamine plans for the long-term detention or prosecution of persons \ndetained or rendered for interrogation purposes.\n  Should the United States, for example, hold detainees without trial \nfor years or decades to come? Is it acceptable to do that for the \nreason that the\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\ndetainees' acknowledgment of their actions came during interrogations \nthat would neither meet the standards of a U.S. court or U.S. military \ncommission?\n  The reality may be that if Congress continues to default in its \noversight and legislative responsibilities, that the courts, in fact, \nthemselves will end up filling that vacuum. The threat of terrorism is \ngoing to be with us for many years, if not decades. The intelligence we \ngain through interrogations will be crucial in protecting Americans \nthemselves against future attacks. If we are to optimize those \ncounterterrorism efforts, we need to have a plan, not an ad hoc policy, \nfor how to deal with people in our custody.\n  America is not a nation that uses or condones torture. We are party \nto international agreements that prohibit these acts, and we demand \nhumane treatment for our citizens when they are arrested abroad and for \nour soldiers when they are captured on the battlefield. We must uphold \nthe same high standards for individuals in our custody or we will \nrightly be branded as hypocrites, and we will put our soldiers and our \ncitizens in danger. I cannot emphasize that enough.\n  Next year will mark the 30th anniversary of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. The committee was created in the crucible of an extensive \nbipartisan investigation in 1975, led by Senators Frank Church and John \nTower, into allegations of abuse by U.S. intelligence agencies. One \nconclusion, as described by Howard Baker--somebody I admire \nenormously--was that the congressional oversight system had provided \n``infrequent and ineffectual review'' and that ``many of the abuses \nrevealed might have been prevented had Congress been doing its job.''\n  Accordingly, the resolution establishing the Intelligence Committee \ncharged it to ``provide vigilant legislative oversight over the \nintelligence activities of the United States to assure that such \nactivities are in conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the \nUnited States.''\n  It is time for the Senate Intelligence Committee to carry out the \nvigilant legislative oversight that is our duty and which a number are \ncalling for us to do. We should launch a comprehensive and constructive \ninvestigation into the detention, interrogation, and rendition \npractices of the intelligence community because it is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nCongressional Record several editorials that have appeared around the \ncountry calling for congressional action. They include editorials from \nmany newspapers, including the Washington Times and newspapers from \nTennessee, Oregon, Florida, Maryland, New York, and California.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, Feb. 17, 2005]\n\n                          Investigate the CIA\n\n       The extensive use of ``extraordinary rendition,'' by which \n     the CIA moves terrorist suspects to undisclosed prisons \n     around the world for interrogation, has to be the agency's \n     worst kept secret. News reports abound of potentially dozens \n     of al-Qaida suspects held overseas by the CIA, incommunicado \n     and without charge or turned over to the security services of \n     other nations known for their abusive treatment of prisoners, \n     such as Egypt and Syria.\n       Congress has been inexcusably reluctant to investigate \n     these actions. The Republican leadership apparently has been \n     happy to let the CIA dirty its hands with extralegal \n     strategies in the nation's efforts to fight terrorism. But \n     thanks to some pushing by Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-\n     W.Va., the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence \n     Committee, Congress may begin to open its eyes. Rockefeller \n     has asked the committee to open a formal investigation into \n     the CIA's use of detention, interrogation and rendition. \n     Rockefeller told the New York Times that he felt the \n     committee would be ``derelict if we did not carry out our \n     oversight responsibilities.''\n       Until now, Congress has done little more than shrug as more \n     evidence has emerged of U.S. intelligence services engaging \n     in brutal interrogations. During the Senate confirmation \n     proceedings of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, it became \n     clear that the CIA had solicited the Justice Department \n     memorandum giving legal cover to those who use aggressive \n     techniques against prisoners. The CIA wanted to protect its \n     agents from criminal liability. And the administration's view \n     remains that the CIA is not bound by the president's 2002 \n     directive that prisoners in American custody be treated \n     humanely. Late last year, when some in Congress sought to \n     impose new limits on abusive interrogation tactics by the \n     CIA, the White House intervened and the those limits were \n     dropped.\n       Congress has willingly collaborated in this charade that \n     America is maintaining its moral authority in the world even \n     as it adopts the tactics of human rights abusers. But as \n     former Secretary of State Colin Powell and retired military \n     leaders have repeatedly warned, when America approves of the \n     use of torture it puts its own soldiers in danger of facing \n     the same brutality.\n       Rockefeller's call for an investigation seems to have some \n     momentum. Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., the Intelligence \n     Committee's chairman, is open to the suggestion. This is \n     Congress' duty. The committee should demand a full accounting \n     of every detainee under the direct or indirect control of the \n     CIA, and it should demand to know precisely what techniques \n     have been used to elicit information. This has been allowed \n     to go on far too long.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Sunday Oregonian, Mar. 6, 2005]\n\n                 The Torture Business Lands In Portland\n\n                          (By David Sarasohn)\n\n       It could make you wonder if congressmen are interested in \n     economic development.\n       Rep Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., is actually asking Congress to \n     investigate a hometown company. Moreover, the company is in a \n     booming business, which will be profiled on ``60 Minutes'' \n     tonight.\n       In fact, this worldwide business is so big, nobody even \n     knows how big it is--or how big it could get.\n       You'd think we'd want a piece of it.\n       But at the end of February, Blumenauer wrote leaders of the \n     International Relations Committee, ``I am simply appalled by \n     continued revelations in the media regarding the torture of \n     detainees in American custody, whether by CIA officials, \n     military personnel, or after being transferred to foreign \n     governments.\n       ``The extensive reports of physical and mental abuse at \n     American detention facilities around the world, the evidence \n     of detainees being turned over to other countries to be \n     interrogated and tortured, and continued efforts by the Bush \n     administration to restrict legal and constitutional \n     protections from detainees form a compelling case that these \n     are not isolated incidents but administration policy.''\n       Moreover, Blumenauer wrote, ``I am additionally troubled by \n     the use of a Gulfstream V jet registered to a shadowy--and \n     possibly illegal--dummy front company, Bayard Foreign \n     Marketing LLC, in my hometown of Portland, Oregon. Press \n     reports have found no public record of the company's alleged \n     owner, nor have calls to their office been successful at \n     locating him. The evidence certainly points to a violation of \n     Oregon law in order to hide the true nature and breadth of \n     this extraordinary rendition program.''\n       Picky, picky, picky.\n       Here we have a Portland company involved in what is clearly \n     a growth industry--the United States shipping prisoners \n     secretly around the world to be tortured by countries that \n     lack the U.S. Constitution or scruples--and people insist on \n     looking at it as a human rights violation instead of an \n     economic development opportunity.\n       In November, the Sunday Times of London reported a flight \n     log for the Gulfstream showing more than 300 flights to \n     countries such as Libya and Uzbekistan--countries that not \n     only offer an expansive view of interrogation, but are \n     normally difficult to get to from Portland. It's not clear \n     if passage on the plane is ever round-trip.\n       At the time, the plane was owned by Premier Executive \n     Transport Services of Dedham, Mass., which the Boston Globe \n     found had the same non-existent corporate structure as Bayard \n     Foreign Marketing. ``Sightings of the plane,'' said the \n     Globe, ``. . . have been published in newspapers across the \n     globe and on the Internet.''\n       Tonight, ``60 Minutes'' profiles another plane in the same \n     business, a Boeing 737 that has made 600 flights since 9/11, \n     including 10 to Uzbekistan--where the British ambassador at \n     one point complained to his superiors and to U.S. authorities \n     about how the prisoners were being tortured, techniques \n     involving rape, suffocation and immersing limbs in boiling \n     liquid.\n       As one of the CIA agents who set up the program explains to \n     the show's reporter, ``It's finding someone else to do your \n     dirty work.''\n       Except that nobody around the world seems to be fooled. \n     When Blumenauer went to East Asia to inspect tsunami damage, \n     people everywhere--China, Thailand, Indonesia--wanted to talk \n     about what happened to those in U.S. custody. ``It just \n     happened repeatedly,'' he said Friday.\n       Last week, when the State Department issued its annual \n     report on human rights, countries from China to Turkey \n     responded that the United States had no standing to comment \n     on the issue. Noting the irony of the United States \n     condemning countries where it was shipping its prisoners, \n     William F. Schulz of Amnesty International suggested, ``The \n     State Department's carefully compiled record of countries' \n     abuses may perversely have been transformed into a Yellow \n     Pages for the outsourcing of torture.''\n       Congress, thinks Blumenauer, might at least want to ask \n     some questions.\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\n       ``There is so much of what is happening that is not \n     accountable,'' he says. ``To suggest that there are thousands \n     of people caught up with this is no exaggeration.''\n       And Blumenauer is now even more interested, since he's \n     found the program is almost a constituent.\n       Torture, it seems, now has a Portland address.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Times Union, Mar. 10, 2005]\n\n                          Torture on the Wing\n\n       Most Americans would cringe at any suggestion that there \n     are parallels between the human rights abuses in Argentina \n     during the 1970s, and Central Intelligence Agency \n     interrogations of suspected terrorists today. But the \n     similarities are there, and that should shame the Bush \n     administration and Congress. An investigation is more than \n     warranted.\n       During the years when a military junta ruled Argentina, \n     suspected political opponents ``disappeared.'' They were \n     imprisoned by government forces and tortured. Many were \n     murdered, but some were returned to the streets to tell their \n     stories.\n       No one has suggested that the CIA interrogators have \n     systematically murdered captives, to be sure. Nor is there \n     any way to know if American citizens have been seized. But \n     the very secrecy of these operations, and the lack of \n     accountability, raise the possibility that such abuses can \n     occur.\n       What is known is distressing enough. Recent news accounts \n     have detailed how CIA agents or mercenaries--it's hard to \n     tell because the captors are masked--have been abducting \n     suspected terrorists, putting them aboard planes and flying \n     them to countries like Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and \n     Afghanistan, where they are interrogated and tortured.\n       The abductions aren't a new development, either. Indeed, \n     former President Clinton once advocated kidnapping Osama bin \n     Laden and turning him over to Saudi Arabia, where he would \n     face ``streamlined'' justice. But according to a New York \n     Times article printed in this newspaper Sunday, the \n     abductions have been stepped up markedly in response to the \n     terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. There is no requirement \n     that the CIA get prior approval from the Justice Department \n     or the White House to seize a suspect. And by sending \n     captives to foreign countries, there is no obligation to \n     afford the captives any rights under American law, including \n     the prohibition against torture.\n       Defenders of these operations claim that they are justified \n     because they have produced information that has saved \n     American lives by thwarting possible terrorist attacks. \n     Others argue that in a time of war, extreme measures are \n     often necessary. Given the urgency of breaking up terrorist \n     plots, they argue, there is little time to observe a long \n     legal process. Moreover, the suspects are most likely \n     foreigners or illegal immigrants, not citizens who are being \n     deprived of their right to due process.\n       The consequences of such abductions can't be so easily \n     dismissed, however. Without a system of checks and balances, \n     there is no way to know whether there was good reason to \n     detain someone. That point was driven home during an \n     interview with one detainee, who told the television news \n     program ``60 Minutes'' last Sunday of being abducted while on \n     vacation in Macedonia, shackled, put on a plane and flown to \n     the Middle East for interrogation. He was later released on \n     his own in Albania after, he claims, his captors acknowledged \n     they had confused his name with that of a terror suspect.\n       Then there's the matter of placing Americans living abroad \n     at risk of being abducted by terrorist organizations who hope \n     to use their hostages to bargain for their comrades' release.\n       Finaily, and hardly least, there is the damage to America's \n     image and values. At the least, Congress should demand some \n     system of accountability to prevent abuses. More than that, \n     it should investigate the claims that these operations have \n     indeed provided life-saving intelligence, or if they have \n     merely tarnished the image of a nation committed to the rule \n     of law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Fresno Bee, Mar. 14, 2005]\n\n Glass Houses Human Rights Report Has One Glaring Omission--the United \n                                 States\n\n       As required by Congress, the State Department has issued \n     its annual report on human rights progress, or the lack of \n     it, in countries around the world.\n       Among those faulted are a number of U.S. allies, including \n     the provisional government in Iraq that is partly a U.S. \n     creature.

Too much is \n     already known to accept the facile explanation that the \n     accumulating scandal reflects only isolated ``rogue'' \n     behavior.\n       And while there have been several investigations, and more \n     continue, all have been conducted by or for the Pentagon, \n     which is unlikely to point the finger of blame upward. \n     Whatever the full truth may be about where ultimate \n     culpability lies, an air of cover-up hovers over the process.\n       On Capitol Hill, Sen.

This standoff suggests a partisan approach to a \n     vital national security matter.\n       What's at stake in the investigation of prisoner abuses is \n     the credibility of this country, which is likelier to be \n     restored through an independent, nonpartisan investigation \n     that lays out whatever facts it finds.\n       Perhaps there is no ``smoking gun'' to be found at the top. \n     But for as long as the process remains an essentially in-\n     house exercise, those annual State Department human rights \n     reports will continue to raise the question: Who is the \n     United States to judge?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 31, 2005]\n\n      American Scar; Permitting Torture Brands Us in the Worst Way\n\n                         (By George Hunsinger)\n\n       When the Senate confirms Alberto R. Gonzales as U.S. \n     attorney general, the vote will be the beginning, not the \n     end, of public debate about our government's policy on \n     torture.\n       The Abu Ghraib scandal is only the most visible sign that \n     this policy is inconsistent. Officially, our government \n     opposes torture and advocates a universal standard for human \n     rights. Yet, at the same time, it has allowed ingenious new \n     interrogation methods to be developed that clearly violate \n     these standards. They include stress positions, sleep \n     deprivation, sexual humiliation and desecration of religious \n     objects. These practices, which should never be used, are no \n     less traumatic than the infliction of excruciating pain.\n       For religious people, torture is especially deplorable \n     because it sins against God and against humanity created in \n     God's image. It degrades everyone involved--planners, \n     perpetrators and victims.\n       More than 225 Christian, Jewish, Muslim and Sikh religious \n     leaders signed an open letter to Mr. Gonzales. They objected \n     to his role in developing a narrow definition of torture and \n     to his equally troubling assertion that some people are not \n     subject to the protections of international law. They \n     registered deep concern about our government's moral \n     foundations, urging support--in practice, not just in words--\n     for fundamental human rights.\n       Four steps must now be taken to clarify that our government \n     has truly abolished torture.\n       First, Congress must remove the false partition placed \n     between the military and intelligence services governing \n     extreme interrogation techniques tantamount to torture. The \n     Senate was right to pass, nearly unanimously, new \n     restrictions for the Pentagon, CIA and other intelligence \n     services. But congressional leaders in both houses later \n     buckled under White House pressure and scrapped the language \n     governing intelligence services.\n       Whether the military or intelligence services are \n     conducting practices tantamount to torture is of absolutely \n     no significance. Trying to differentiate between the two \n     perhaps eases the conscience of decision-makers, but it is a \n     distinction without a difference. It fails to insulate us \n     from the absolute evil that is torture.\n       Second, Congress must outlaw ``extraordinary rendition,'' a \n     euphemism for torture by proxy. It means that detainees are \n     secretly transferred to countries where torture is practiced \n     as a means of interrogation. Although made public only \n     through shocking cases, such as those of Maher Arar, who was \n     deported to Syria by the United States, and Mamdouh Habib, an \n     Australian citizen who was sent to Egypt before being held at \n     Guantanamo, it has become a mainstay counterterrorism tool.\n       Does it really need to be said that ``disappearing'' people \n     without any kind of due process is contrary to everything \n     America stands for, not to mention our laws and treaties? The \n     reasons for a detainee's arrest and his guilt or innocence \n     are irrelevant. No sound moral argument can be made that \n     enabling torture through rendition is permissible.\n       Third, Mr. Bush should make a clear statement that torture \n     is wrong in any form and under any circumstances. He should \n     state beyond a shadow of doubt that America will not be \n     complicit in its commission. Leadership from the president \n     would go a long way toward resolving the torture crisis.\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\n       Finally, America needs a special prosecutor. Our reputation \n     has been so badly damaged by Guantanamo, Bagram and Abu \n     Ghraib that no other remedy will do. The existing \n     investigations are not enough because they have not been \n     truly independent. Organizations such as the American Bar \n     Association, Amnesty International and the highly respected \n     International Commission of Jurists in Geneva have all \n     insisted that an independent investigation is imperative.\n       Nothing less is at stake in the torture crisis than the \n     soul of our nation. What does it profit us if we proclaim \n     high moral values but fail to reject torture? What does it \n     signify if torture is condemned in word but allowed in deed? \n     A nation that rewards those who permitted and promoted \n     torture is approaching spiritual death.\n       George Hunsinger is McCord professor of theology at \n     Princeton Theological Seminary and coordinator of Church \n     Folks for a Better America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From Chattanooga Times Free Press, Feb. 8, 2005]\n\n                        Stories From the Inside\n\n       ``During the whole time we were at Guantanamo,'' said \n     Shafiq Rasul, ``we were at a high level of fear. When we \n     first got there the level was sky-high. At the beginning we \n     were terrified that we might be killed at any minute. The \n     guards would say to us, `We could kill you at any time.' They \n     would say, `The world doesn't know you're here. Nobody knows \n     you're here. All they know is that you're missing, and we \n     could kill you and no one would know.' ''\n       The horror stories from the scandalous interrogation camp \n     that the United States is operating at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, \n     are coming to light with increased frequency. At some point \n     the whole shameful tale of this exercise in extreme human \n     degradation will be told. For the time being we have to piece \n     together what we can from a variety of accounts that have \n     escaped the government's obsessively reinforced barriers of \n     secrecy.\n       We know that people were kept in cells that in some cases \n     were the equivalent of animal cages, and that some detainees, \n     disoriented and despairing, have been shackled like slaves \n     and left to soil themselves with their own urine and feces. \n     Detainees are frequently kicked, punched, beaten and sexually \n     humiliated. Extremely long periods of psychologically \n     damaging isolation are routine.\n       This is all being done in the name of fighting terror. But \n     the best evidence seems to show that many of the people \n     rounded up and dumped without formal charges into Guantanamo \n     had nothing to do with terror. They just happened to be \n     unfortunate enough to get caught in one of Uncle Sam's \n     depressingly indiscriminate sweeps. Which is what happened to \n     Shafiq Rasul, who was released from Guantanamo about a year \n     ago. His story is instructive, and has not been told widely \n     enough.\n       Rasul was one of three young men, all friends, from the \n     British town of Tipton who were among thousands of people \n     seized in Afghanistan in the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001. \n     They had been there, he said, to distribute food and medical \n     supplies to impoverished Afghans.\n       The three were interviewed soon after their release by \n     Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional \n     Rights, which has been in the forefront of efforts to secure \n     legal representation for Guantanamo detainees.\n       Under extreme duress at Guantanamo, including hundreds of \n     hours of interrogation and long periods of isolation, the \n     three men confessed to having been in a terrorist training \n     camp in Afghanistan. They also said they were among a number \n     of men who could be seen in a videotape of Osama bin Laden. \n     The tape had been made in August 2000.\n       For the better part of two years, Rasul and his friends, \n     Asif Iqbal and Rhuhel Ahmed, had denied involvement in any \n     terror activity whatsoever. But Rasul said they eventually \n     succumbed to long months of physical and psychological abuse. \n     Rasul had been held in isolation for several weeks (his \n     second sustained period of isolation) when an interrogator \n     showed him the video of bin Laden. He said she told him: \n     ``I've put detainees here in isolation for 12 months and \n     eventually they've broken. You might as well admit it now.''\n       ``I could not bear another day of isolation, let alone the \n     prospect of another year,'' said Rasul. He confessed.\n       The three men, all British citizens, were saved by British \n     intelligence officials, who proved that they had been in \n     England when the video was shot, and during the time they \n     were supposed to have been in Qaida training camps. All three \n     were returned to England, where they were released from \n     custody.\n       Rasul has said many times that he and his friends were \n     freed only because their alibis were corroborated. But they \n     continue to worry about the many other Guantanamo detainees \n     who may be innocent but have no way of proving it.\n       The Bush administration has turned Guantanamo into a place \n     that is devoid of due process and the rule of law. It's a \n     place where human beings can be imprisoned for life without \n     being charged or tried, without ever seeing a lawyer, and \n     without having their cases reviewed by a court. Congress and \n     the courts should be uprooting this evil practice, but \n     freedom and justice in the United States are on a post-9/ll \n     downhill slide.\n       So we are stuck for the time being with the disgrace of \n     Guantanamo, which will forever be a stain on the history of \n     the United States, like the internment of the Japanese in \n     World War II.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I regret that I am compelled to speak on \nthis subject. The topic of the day is the confirmation of Ambassador \nJohn Negroponte to be the new National Director of Intelligence, but it \nappears as if that topic has now changed, and I have no alternative but \nto respond in that basically the purpose and the responsibilities of \nthe Intelligence Committee have been challenged by the vice chairman.\n  I understand that the vice chairman feels strongly about this issue. \nWe have discussed this at length--not as much as I had hoped and that \nwe had intended to--to seek common ground, but he feels so strongly \nthat he offered an amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill, \nwhich he has discussed.\n  I feel equally as strong, so much so that I filed a second-degree \namendment in response. My second-degree amendment is in stark contrast \nto the amendment offered by my colleague and my friend. My amendment \nactually expresses support for our Armed Forces and intelligence \nofficers, rather than calling into question their actions, while they \nare on the front lines in the war on terror. The amendment underscored \nthe Intelligence Committee's continuing aggressive oversight of all \naspects of the war on terror, including terrorist detention and \ninterrogation.\n  The Rockefeller amendment is a sense of the Senate, as he indicated, \ncalling for the Intelligence Committee to launch yet another formal \ninvestigation of the men and women who are prosecuting the war against \nthe terrorists. The proposed Rockefeller investigation, as I read the \nparameters originally proposed and then refined, I think would be \nvirtually boundless in its exploration of any matter even tangentially \nrelated to the use of rendition, detention, and interrogation of \nterrorists.\n  I want my colleagues to know that these are the very tools that are \nbeing used by our brave men and women in the military and intelligence \nagencies to combat a continuing terrorist threat against every American \nand our interests. They are also critical in our efforts in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and they are saving lives as I speak.\n  I oppose the efforts of Senator Rockefeller to launch yet another \nwide-ranging investigation because I believe, despite what he \nbelieves--and reasonable men can certainly disagree--that it is \ncurrently unnecessary. I believe it would be impractical and damaging \nto the ongoing operations and morale of the people who are doing the \njob.\n  We are not sitting on the sidelines. We are not being passive, we are \nnot rebuffing, we are not defaulting, and we sure as heck are not going \nto let the media drive the agenda within the Intelligence Committee \nwith regard to classified information and our national security. The \nSenate Intelligence Committee, in the conduct of its normal but \naggressive oversight responsibilities, is examining the broad issues of \nthe effectiveness of interrogation operations, the humane treatment of \ndetainees, the role of intelligence in tribunals and combatant status \nreview boards, and, yes, rendition operations.\n  In conducting this oversight, just this past month committee staff--\nboth minority and majority--once again visited the detention facility \nat Guantanamo Bay for onsite inspections, briefings, and discussions. \nThe committee is continuing its oversight through visits, interviews of \nrelevant individuals and personnel, through requests of documents, \nreviews of prior investigations, and briefings from intelligence \ncommunity element, using basically the same methodology we used during \nthe WMD review and investigation.\n\n  In other words, we are doing our job. I believe we are fulfilling our \noversight responsibilities. And there are still ongoing investigations, \nincluding the Navy inspector general's investigation into FBI \nallegations of abuse at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and the comprehensive \nefforts of the CIA inspector general of which we are fully informed to \nthe degree that we have never been informed before.\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\n  Further, I believe the Rockefeller proposal is unnecessary because \nthis issue has been thoroughly investigated over the past 3 years. We \nhave investigated and investigated and investigated. In fact, we have \ninvestigated the investigations.\n  Let me give you an idea of how many times our own people have been \ninvestigated: in January 2002, the Custer report; January 2003, the DOD \ngeneral counsel and DOD working group, with relation to the \ninterrogation of detainees held in the global war on terrorism; \nSeptember 2003, the Miller report; November 2003, the Ryder report; May \n2004, the Navy inspector general review; June 2004, the Taguba report \nin regard to the tragedy that happened in Abu Ghraib; June 2004, the \nJacoby report; July 2004, the Mikolashek report; August 2004, the Jones \nand Fay investigation; mid-August 2004, the Schlesinger Commission; \nAugust 2004, the Formica report; December 2004, the Army Reserve \nCommand inspector general's assessment of military intelligence and \nmilitary police training; March 2005, last month, the Church report.\n  This issue has been--and will continue to be--thoroughly investigated \nby inspectors general and criminal investigators from the DOD, all of \nthe uniformed services, the CIA, and the Justice Department. It is hard \nto keep track, but I count at least 15 comprehensive national level \ninvestigations and well over 300 investigations of specific allegations \nof abuse. Between these investigations and our regular and aggressive \noversight--I will emphasize, our regular, aggressive oversight--I am \ncomfortable as chairman that the Intelligence Committee is meeting its \nresponsibilities.\n  I want my colleagues to also think about something else. Last year, \njust as we have talked about, we enacted the most comprehensive \nreorganization of the intelligence community since its creation over 50 \nyears ago. We created the position of the Director of National \nIntelligence and gave him new authorities and enormous \nresponsibilities, further encumbered by our very high expectations. We \nhave all spoken to that during this confirmation process.\n  If the Intelligence Committee embarks on an unnecessary and boundless \nwhat some would even call a fishing expedition that is surely to be \ntainted by politics, suggested by any leak that has appeared in the \npress, it will be the first thing that greets the new DNI when he takes \noffice. As Ambassador Negroponte begins the difficult process of fixing \nwhat we and numerous commissions have said need fixing, he would be met \nwith endless requests for documents, interviews, and hearings. So \nAmbassador Negroponte and General Hayden need to hit the ground \nrunning, and that would be exceedingly hard to do if they land right in \nthe middle of an unnecessary congressional investigation.\n  I believe that would be a very serious mistake and contrary to the \nintent of Congress.\n  Finally, I oppose Senator Rockefeller's investigation because it will \nhinder ongoing intelligence collection, and I believe it would damage \nmorale.\n  My colleagues should know there is a consensus in the intelligence \ncommunity that terrorist interrogations are the single best source of \nactionable intelligence against the ongoing plans and plots of our \nenemy. Terrorist interrogations today are saving lives in Iraq--\nAmerican lives, Iraqi lives, Afghan lives--and are subverting plots \nagainst our own homeland.\n  The information gleaned from interrogating terrorists is doing \nexactly what I said in terms of the priority that we have and our \nresponsibilities on the Intelligence Committee in reference to our \nnational security. The majority of usable and actionable intelligence \nagainst al-Qaida comes from the terrorist interrogations and \ndebriefings. We must preserve this irreplaceable source of information. \nDo it right, yes, but we must preserve it.\n  There is no doubt that this is a delicate intelligence oversight \nissue. The oversight of detention and interrogation does command a \nlarge portion of the Intelligence Committee staff and time and effort. \nWe must continue to treat interrogation as a delicate oversight issue \nor we risk losing it.\n  I am concerned an unnecessary informal investigation would accomplish \nlittle beyond what we already do in the course of our normal and, yes, \naggressive oversight efforts. As I have said on other occasions, it \nwill likely cause risk aversion, the very thing we are trying to avoid.\n  The constant and repetitive investigations of our frontline personnel \nwill have a chilling effect, a no-confidence vote, really, on the \ncollection of intelligence through interrogations.\n  The Senate and the Intelligence Committee should be publicly \nsupportive of our men and women of our Armed Forces and intelligence \nagencies because the overwhelming majority of these people are doing \ntheir best to protect us all. Where there have been allegations, they \nare reported and they are being investigated. And after they are \ninvestigated, they are turned over to the Justice Department, if \nwarranted, and people are being charged.\n  Frankly, I am fast losing patience with what appears to me to be \nalmost a pathological obsession with calling into question the actions \nof the men and women who are on the front line in the war on terror. \nSome of these very courageous individuals wear uniforms and some do \nnot. They leave their spouses and children at home, after assuring them \nthat everything will be all right, with the understanding that it may \nnot be all right, and sometimes it is not all right. They travel to the \nother side of the world in the service of their country with a \nreasonable expectation that their country supports them. At times they \nmake mistakes, and sometimes they make serious mistakes for which they \nmust account, and rightfully so, and we are doing that.\n  But as we sit here in the relative safety and comfort of the Capitol \ncomplex, I cannot help but think that some of us have lost our \nperspective. We will and must do our duty as elected officials. As I \nhave indicated, we will continue aggressive oversight on this issue, \nand we will reach out to our friends across the aisle to incorporate \ntheir concerns. But, Mr. President, I say to my friends, we are at war. \nTherefore, our first and foremost duty is to support our troops and \nintelligence officers at home and abroad. I, for one, will not advocate \nusing the constitutional authorities vested in this great institution \nas a blunt instrument on the very people we depend on to keep us safe \nevery day.\n  I am on their side. And make no mistake, if we sanction another \nneedless investigation, it will be a very public vote of no confidence \nin our men and women on the front lines in the war on terror. I, for \none, have not lost confidence in our people.\n  The Senator from West Virginia referred to the almost daily \nrevelations regarding the alleged abuses. It is very clear to me what \nis happening. Facts already known to us and to investigators are now \nfinding their way into the press through Freedom of Information Act \nrequests and, quite frankly, leaks. In Washington, a leak is not a leak \nuntil somebody gets wet. I can tell you, on the Intelligence Committee, \nwe are right about up to here, and the same thing is true in many other \nagencies.\n  I do not think I am being conspiratorial when I suggest this is a \ndeliberate effort to give the public the impression that this is an \nongoing and growing problem. It is not. I do not believe it is. \nMistakes have been made by our military and our intelligence agencies, \nand the Justice Department has responded properly with investigations \nof abuse and misconduct. We will oversee that. We are being told that, \nand we are being kept fully informed. I will always meet our oversight \nduties using facts not press reports.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this, as we have two options to \ntake. Again, I offer the open door of suggestions just as we did with \nthe WMD inquiry to incorporate concerns of the minority on the \ncommittee with responsibilities as I see them as chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee and do our due diligence.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining under the \nagreement that was entered into earlier?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALEXANDER). The Senator has 29 minutes \nremaining.\n\n[[Page S4066]]\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Needless to \nsay, all of us on the Intelligence Committee do all of this for the \nprotection of the American people and protection of the American \ntroops. That goes without saying.\n  I have to say that all of the investigations to which my friend and \ndistinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee referred in his \nremarks were all about the military. None of them were authorized to \nget into or had access to information about the Central Intelligence \nAgency and its role. We do not investigate the military in particular; \nthe Armed Services Committee does. We investigate the Central \nIntelligence Agency and any other intelligence efforts with respect to \ndetention, interrogation, and rendition.\n  So there are lots of studies that have been done, but there are \nprecious few, if any, that have been done with respect to the \nintelligence community.\n  I have put forward this amendment because I think it must be done. I \ndo not consider it irrational. I do not consider it against our troops. \nI think I made the point it is in part to protect our troops because we \nare going to be facing these kinds of situations for years and years to \ncome.\n  I look forward to and I have some confidence that the chairman and \nmyself and members of the committee can come to an agreement on how we \napproach this in a way which works, gives us the information we need, \nand we can proceed forward to protect our soldiers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will speak very briefly on this matter \nbecause I would like to support Senator Rockefeller's call for an \ninquiry into this area, particularly as it relates to rendition.\n  Let me begin by saying that I strongly agree with my friend and \nchairman, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, with respect to how \nimportant a time this is with our people in harm's way. Chairman \nRoberts is absolutely right that the fight against terrorists certainly \nis not a nice business. We understand that.\n  I want to take a minute and support Senator Rockefeller in the hopes \nwe can work this out and do it in a bipartisan way along the route we \ntook with respect to Iraq, where we got a unanimous agreement in our \ncommittee and showed a difficult area could be tackled in a bipartisan \nway.\n  The reason I support Senator Rockefeller and want this matter \naddressed is I think this inquiry could especially provide another \nuseful tool in our fight against al-Qaida. I say that because the \nlonger the war against al-Qaida and its associates goes on, the more we \nrealize what a sophisticated enemy we are facing.\n  Bin Laden and his followers understand the modern media, both here \nand abroad. They know that allegations of torture and mistreatment \nundercut our efforts amongst our allies and influences world opinion \nagainst the United States. It seems to me we cannot allow ourselves to \nbe defamed by deceitful and murderous madmen who have learned how to \nmanipulate public perception.\n  What Senator Rockefeller is talking about would provide us, through \nan inquiry, the opportunity to discredit information collected from al-\nQaida and other terrorists in custody. Torture is not an effective way \nof getting valuable, credible intelligence. A suspect in extreme pain \nor psychological stress will lie about anything and everything \nnecessary to stop what that suspect is enduring, and if the possibility \nof torture is removed, those analyzing the information will have \ngreater faith in the reporting.\n  If, however, an investigation proves that torture was used by anyone, \nwe will have an additional reason to question the information and \nbetter ability to determine the truth from fabrication. So I come to \nthe floor today to say I support Senator Rockefeller in terms of his \nrequest. I think Senator Roberts, the chairman of our committee, makes \na very valid point about the sensitivity of this time, our people being \nin harm's way, terrorists will stop at nothing, and I think what \nSenator Rockefeller is talking about could provide an additional tool, \nan additional opportunity, to strengthen the fight against al-Qaida by \npublicly correcting their lies and to give us an opportunity to expose \nthe al-Qaida spin machine.\n  I have spoken at some length on the floor this afternoon, but I want \nto make clear that I hope the distinguished chairman and the ranking \nmember can work this out. I support Senator Rockefeller.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President. I rise today in support of the nomination of \nAmbassador John D. Negroponte to serve as our first Director of \nNational Intelligence, a position whose importance to our national \nsecurity cannot be stressed enough.\n  After 9/11 and the failure of the intelligence community to predict \nthe absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, study after study \nhas told us that our intelligence system is broken, and desperately in \nneed of repair. We began the process of fixing our intelligence \ncommunity in December, when we passed the Intelligence Reform Act of \n2004. Arguably the most important part of that legislation was the \ncreation of a new position--the Director of National Intelligence--with \nappropriate budgetary and personnel authority to effectively coordinate \nthe fifteen different intelligence agencies. Eliminating gaps and \nensuring that our intelligence agencies are working together is vital \nto winning the war against al Qaeda, as well as to our long-term \nnational security.\n  That having been said, the mere creation of this position was not a \nsilver bullet. Many challenges lie ahead for the new DNI. Transforming \nour intelligence agencies--getting them to work together and share \ninformation--will not be easy. According to the Robb-Silverman \nCommission, turf battles are again emerging between the Central \nIntelligence Agency, CIA, Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, and \nDepartment of Defense, DOD. These turf battles contributed to past \nintelligence failures, and if we are going to truly reform the \nintelligence community, we need to put an end to this. The key to a \nwell-functioning intelligence community is to resolve these disputes in \nthe best interest of the country, and not one agency or another. \nIndependence and strong leadership are essential to the DNI's success.\n  Good intelligence is vital to our ability to protect against the \nthreats we face today, as well as the threats we will face in the \nfuture. That cannot happen without better management, a DNI to \ncoordinate all of our intelligence efforts--to make sure everyone \ninvolved remembers that we are all on the same team, working toward the \nsame goal. It is critical that he succeed in making meaningful changes \nto our intelligence community. These are high hurdles, but I believe \nAmbassador Negroponte is up to the job.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to discuss the nomination of John \nNegroponte to be the first Director of National Intelligence. This is a \nnew position created by Congress as a key element of intelligence \nreform after the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and after the \nmany failures we saw concerning intelligence on Iraq and weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  I want to discuss one particular aspect of the problems we had with \nthe intelligence community, and how I hope Ambassador Negroponte will \nimprove upon that situation.\n  In the course of conducting oversight of the executive branch, \nCongress requires information and documents produced by the executive \nbranch, including from the intelligence community. This is especially \ntrue in cases where Congress, or members of Congress, are conducting \noversight for which they are responsible.\n  Unfortunately, it has been disturbingly difficult to obtain \ninformation and documents from this administration on a number of \nserious issues and from a number of agencies, including from the \nintelligence community, as well as from the Defense and Justice \nDepartments.\n  The only conclusion I can draw from my experience in seeking \ninformation and documents from this administration as part of my \noversight responsibilities is that too often they have not cooperated \nfully or appropriately.\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\n  Let me turn to some specific examples. Each year, the Armed Services \nCommittee holds a hearing with the senior leaders of the intelligence \ncommunity on worldwide threats. After the hearings, members write \nquestions for the record, and the answers are made part of the official \nhearing record.\n  Last year, on March 9, 2004, the Armed Services Committee held its \nannual worldwide threat hearing with the Director of Central \nIntelligence or DCI, George Tenet, and the Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency, Admiral Lowell Jacoby. But the CIA did not answer \nall the questions for the record until one year later, after I brought \nthis delay to the attention of the new DCI, Porter Goss.\n  In June 2003, as the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, \nI initiated a minority staff inquiry into the pre-war intelligence on \nIraq, and the use of that intelligence by the administration. In order \nto conduct this inquiry, it was necessary to request many documents \nfrom the intelligence community, as well as from the Defense \nDepartment.\n  Although the intelligence community provided some documents, they \nstonewalled other requests. For example, on April 9, 2004, I wrote to \nDirector of Central Intelligence George Tenet, requesting the \ndeclassification of three sets of briefing charts produced by the \nOffice of Under Secretary of Defense Douglas Feith concerning the Iraq-\nal Qaeda relationship. The charts contained intelligence that only the \nintelligence community could declassify.\n\n  I knew that one slide, which had been declassified previously at my \nrequest, was highly critical of the intelligence community's assessment \nof the Iraq-al Qaeda issue, and that it had been shown to Defense \nSecretary Rumsfeld and later to the staffs of the Office of the Vice \nPresident and the National Security Council, but that it had not been \nshown to DCI Tenet when he was briefed.\n  On July 6th, I received a letter from Stanley Moskowitz, the Director \nof Congressional Affairs at the CIA. His letter said that in response \nto my April 9 request, the ``declassification review of the charts is \nunderway and we hope to have an answer to you shortly. We apologize for \nthe delay.''\n  However, although his staff told my staff that they were working on \nthe request, and later that they had completed the review, the \ndocuments were not forthcoming, nor was an explanation for the delay. I \nfinally received the documents earlier this month, after the current \nDirector of Central Intelligence, Porter Goss, provided them.\n  In another example, on April 29, 2004, I requested the \ndeclassification of specific portions of three finished intelligence \nreports from the CIA concerning the relationship between Iraq and al \nQaeda. I requested that they respond by May 10th, but they did not \nreply for 2 months.\n  In that same July 6th letter from Stanley Moskowitz, it said that, in \nresponse to my April 29 request, ``the declassification review is \nunderway and we hope to have an answer to you shortly.''\n  However, the CIA did not provide an answer ``shortly.'' It did not \nprovide any answer until after Director Tenet had left the CIA, and I \nhad brought the situation to the attention of the new management team. \nThe declassified materials were finally provided on April 6, 2005, \nnearly a year after the request.\n  I have had similar problems with obtaining documents from the \nDepartment of Defense. I made a request for documents on November 25, \n2003, and I am still awaiting documents from that request.\n  In that case, the Defense Department said it was withholding some of \nthe documents to determine whether they were covered by executive \nprivilege. It did so until late March, when it finally provided some of \nthe documents, 16 months after my original request. I would note that \nit is unclear what possible executive privilege concern could exist for \nthese documents, some of which were unclassified talking points to be \nused by Pentagon officials.\n  In the same case, the Defense Department originally told me they were \nwithholding some documents containing intelligence information that was \n``Originator Controlled,'' also known as ORCON. The Department promised \nme that they would provide any documents cleared for release by the \nCIA. But instead of doing so, they simply swept all the CIA-cleared \ndocuments into their executive privilege review.\n  The new leadership of the CIA and the Intelligence Community, Porter \nGoss, is adopting a more responsive and responsible attitude toward \ncongressional requests for information and documents than did his \npredecessor.\n  After I brought these delays to his attention at a hearing in March, \nhe said he would look into the matter and ensure that the information \nwas provided. And he did what he promised. On April 6th, he wrote me a \nletter as a follow-up to providing me the materials that had been \ndelayed so long.\n  I would like to quote from the last paragraph of his letter:\n\n       You should have received answers to these requests months \n     ago. There is no excuse for such delays. I have conveyed to \n     my staff that this is not how the Agency will treat requests.\n\n  That is the right approach to take. After all the frustrating delays \nand stonewalling, it is a welcome breath of fresh air. And I hope the \nwindow stays open for the whole Intelligence Community.\n  This brings me back to the nomination of Ambassador Negroponte to be \nthe new leader of the Intelligence Community. At his nomination hearing \nbefore the Intelligence Committee, I asked him about this problem of \nstonewalling, ignoring, or delaying on requests for information and \ndocuments. I asked him if he would ensure that the intelligence \ncommunity provides timely and responsive answers to such requests, and \nhe basically said he would look into the situation.\n  Frankly, I was hoping he would have a more robust and positive \nanswer, and that he would commit to taking steps, if confirmed, to \nensure that the intelligence community is fully responsive in a timely \nmanner to congressional requests for information and documents.\n  However, I am hopeful that when Ambassador Negroponte does look into \nthe matter, he will be more responsive, in light of the law we just \npassed. He has a responsibility to the Nation, to the Congress, and to \nthe people--not just to the President.\n  I have some of the correspondence outlining the problems I have \ndescribed, and I would ask unanimous consent that they be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 2004.\n     Hon. George Tenet,\n     Director of Central Intelligence,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Director: I am writing to request information and \n     action relative to a series of three briefings presented by \n     the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy \n     (OUSDP), Douglas Feith, to several audiences, entitled \n     ``Assessing the Relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda.'' I \n     believe you received a copy of these briefings as attachments \n     to a letter written by Under Secretary Feith to me on March \n     25, 2004, a copy of which he sent to you.\n       According to Secretary Feith, the first briefing was \n     presented to the Secretary of Defense in August, 2002. The \n     second briefing was presented to you in August, 2002. The \n     third briefing was presented to staff of the National \n     Security Council (NSC) and the Office of the Vice President \n     (OVP) in September, 2002.\n       I am requesting the following:\n       1. As these briefings contain intelligence information, I \n     request that you declassify the briefings, to the greatest \n     possible extent. One page used in two of the briefings (to \n     the Secretary of Defense and to the NSC/OVP staffs) has \n     already been declassified at my request.\n       2. Did the CIA see and clear these briefings before they \n     were presented to the Secretary of Defense and to NSC and OVP \n     staffs? If so, when? Did CIA request changes to the \n     briefings? Given that they contain intelligence information \n     controlled by the originating agencies, would such clearance \n     requests be the normal course of action?\n       3. Please explain when you and when the CIA first learned \n     of the existence of the OUSDP briefs; when you and the CIA \n     first learned that this briefing was going to be (or had \n     been) provided to the Secretary of Defense and to NSC and OVP \n     staffs; and when the CIA first learned that a different \n     version of the briefing was going to be (or had been) \n     presented to NSC and OVP staffs than had been presented to \n     the CIA.\n       4. Please provide the CIA's views on two aspects of these \n     briefings: first, the substantive findings and conclusions \n     (both implied and explicit) of the briefings; and second, the \n     reliability of each intelligence item or report cited in the \n     briefings.\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\n       5. Please provide your views on the appropriateness of two \n     activities: first, the presentation by non-Intelligence \n     Community personnel to senior policymakers or administration \n     officials of any formal intelligence analysis that is not \n     cleared by the Intelligence Community or made known to it; \n     and second, the provision of comments and edits by entities \n     outside of the Intelligence Community on the contents of \n     Intelligence Community products, whether draft or final.\n       I appreciate your assistance in this request, and I look \n     forward to your response by April 23, 2004.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n      Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2004.\n     Hon. George Tenet,\n     Director of Central Intelligence, Central Intelligence \n         Agency, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Tenet: I request that you declassify the \n     following information:\n       (1) From the June 21, 2002 Counter-Terrorism Center \n     document relating to Iraq's relationship to al Qaeda (CTC \n     2002-40078CH): In the Key Findings section, p. i, third \n     bullet under the first paragraph; p. iii, second bullet; p. v \n     in its entirety (the Scope Note); In the main body of the \n     report, p. 6, the second section on the page (first and \n     second columns, one paragraph and two sub-bullets).\n       (2) From the October 2, 2002 National Intelligence Estimate \n     on Iraq and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) (NIE 2002-\n     16HC): p. 68, the first non-bulleted full paragraph and the \n     two subsequent sub-bullets.\n       (3) From the January 29, 2003 Counter-Terrorism Center \n     document relating to Iraq and terrorism (CTC 2003-40004HJX): \n     beginning on p. 16, the section that begins with the last \n     paragraph on the page, all of page 17, and the first two \n     bullets on page 19; p. 27, second column: the section heading \n     and first full paragraph under the heading; and the second-\n     to-last full paragraph.\n       I would expect that expeditious declassification should be \n     possible, given that you have already declassified \n     significant portions of the October 2002 NIE, including all \n     the key judgments, all the text concerning uranium, and the \n     alternative views of the State Department's Bureau of \n     Intelligence and Research.\n       Please have a member of your staff call Richard Fieldhouse \n     of the Committee staff at 202-224-0750 with any questions or \n     requests for clarification.\n       I appreciate your assistance with this request and look \n     forward to your response by May 10, 2004.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The Director of Central\n\n\n                                                 Intelligence,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2005.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I have confirmed that responses to the \n     long outstanding requests you brought to my attention during \n     the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) Global \n     Intelligence Challenges hearing have now been provided to the \n     Committee. As you made me aware, these requests were from \n     last year's Worldwide Threat hearing, as well as from \n     correspondence dating back to last April. As promised, I \n     instructed Agency personnel to promptly complete their review \n     and provide appropriate and meaningful answers.\n       You should have received answers to these requests months \n     ago. There is no excuse for such delays. I have conveyed to \n     my staff that this is not how the Agency will treat requests.\n           Sincerely,\n     Porter J. Goss.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Central Intelligence Agency,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 6, 2004.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Ranking Democratic Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: I am responding on behalf of the \n     Director of Central Intelligence to your letter of 9 April \n     2004 requesting information and action relative to a series \n     of briefings presented by the Office of the Under Secretary \n     of Defense for Policy, Douglas Feith, to several audiences, \n     entitled ``Assessing the Relationship between Iraq and al \n     Queda.'' Specifically, you asked five questions. The \n     responses to your questions are provided below.\n       1. As these briefings contain intelligence information, I \n     request that you declassify the briefings, to the greatest \n     possible extent. One page used in two of the briefings (to \n     the Secretary of Defense and to the NSC/OVP staffs) has \n     already been declassified at my request.\n       Answer: The declassification review of the charts is \n     underway and we hope to have an answer to you shortly. We \n     apologize for the delay.\n       2. Did the CIA see and clear these briefings before they \n     were presented to the Secretary of Defense and to the NSC and \n     OVP staffs? If so, when? Did CIA request changes to the \n     briefings? Given that they contain intelligence information \n     controlled by the originating agencies, would such clearance \n     requests be the normal course of action?\n       Answer: CIA did not see or clear these briefings before \n     they were given to the Secretary of Defense, NSC or OVP. The \n     intelligence information used in these briefings was from \n     products previously disseminated to IC and Executive Branch \n     elements, to include DoD and the White House. There was no \n     need for further clearance in presenting the intelligence \n     information to the Secretary of Defense, NSC or OVP as the \n     originator control clearance had been resolved at the time of \n     initial dissemination.\n       3. Please explain when you and when CIA first learned of \n     the existence of the OUSDP briefs; when you and the CIA first \n     learned that this briefing was. going to be (or had ,been) \n     provided to the Secretary of Defense and to NSC and OVP \n     staffs; and when CIA first learned that a different version \n     of the briefing was going to be (or had been) presented to \n     NSC and OVP staffs than had been presented to the CIA.\n       Answer: We first learned of the brief in mid-August 2002 \n     when it was presented to the DCI. We believe it was at that \n     point that we learned that it had been presented to senior \n     levels in the Pentagon. We did not learn that it had been \n     presented to the NSC and OVP or that there were different \n     versions until earlier this year.\n       4. Please provide the CIA's views on two aspects of these \n     briefings: first, the substantive findings and conclusions \n     (both implied and explicit) of the briefings; and second, the \n     reliability of each intelligence item or report cited in the \n     briefings.\n       Answer: The CIA's January 2003 paper, Iraqi Support for \n     Terrorism, represents the CIA views on the issues covered in \n     the DoD slides. This paper has been provided to the \n     Committee.\n       5. Please provide your views on the appropriateness of two \n     activities: first, the presentation by non-Intelligence \n     Community personnel to senior policymakers or administration \n     officials of any formal intelligence analysis that is not \n     cleared by the Intelligence Community or made known to it; \n     and second, the provision of comments and edits by entities \n     outside of the Intelligence Community on the contents of the \n     Intelligence Community products, whether draft or final.\n       Answer: The DCI responded to a similar question from you at \n     the 9 March 2004 hearing. He said, ``My experience is that \n     people come in and may present those kinds of briefings on \n     their views of intelligence, but I have to tell you, Senator, \n     I'm the President's chief intelligence officer; I have the \n     definitive view about these subjects. From my perspective it \n     is my view that prevails.''\n       Lastly, in response to your 29 April 2004 letter requesting \n     the declassification of information contained in two \n     Counterterrorism Center publications and the October 2002 \n     National Intelligence Estimate, the declassification review \n     is underway and we hope to have an answer to you shortly.\n       Sincerely,\n                                             Stanley M. Moskowitz,\n                                Director of Congressional Affairs.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \nJohn Negroponte to be the first Director of National Intelligence, DNI. \nI have the utmost respect for Ambassador Negroponte and confidence that \nhe will excel in this position.\n  It is apparent that there is a need to improve our Nation's \nintelligence capabilities. The passage of the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act, by creating the position of Director of \nNational Intelligence, is an important step in achieving this goal. \nCreating centralized leadership in the intelligence community will \nprovide better management of capabilities and produce common standards \nand practices across the foreign and domestic intelligence divide. The \nposition of DNI will better allow the intelligence community to set \npriorities and move resources where they are most needed. The position \nof DNI is going to be difficult and demanding. I believe Ambassador \nNegroponte's experience and character make him an excellent choice to \ntake on this vast responsibility.\n  From 1960 to 1997 Ambassador Negroponte was a member of the Career \nForeign Service, serving at eight different posts in Asia, Europe, and \nLatin America. He has been Ambassador to Honduras, Mexico, and the \nPhilippines. Ambassador Negroponte also served as Assistant Secretary \nof State for Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific \nAffairs and as Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security \naffairs.\n  More recently, Mr. Negroponte distinguished himself as ambassador to \nthe United Nations, during the difficult time immediately after the \nterrorist attacks of September 11. Furthermore Mr. Negroponte last year \nbecame the first American Ambassador to Iraq since the fall of Saddam \nHussein. In this role he played an important role in moving the nation \nof Iraq towards a democratic and stable future.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has a long and distinguished career during his \nmore than 40 years of service to this\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\ncountry. During that time he faced many challenges and difficult \nsituations. I have the highest expectations that he will take on the \nassignment as Director of National Intelligence with the same \ndedication he has shown in the past. Under his leadership, I believe \nAmerica will have the intelligence capability it so urgently needs to \nfight and win the continuing global war on terror.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of John Negroponte \nto be confirmed as the Director of National Intelligence. These are \nhistoric and perilous times as we continue to face enemies intent upon \nattacking us and the values and freedoms upon which our Nation was \nfounded.\n  Because we still know very little about our Nation's most dangerous \nadversaries, the new Director of National Intelligence will be \nresponsible for ensuring that this Nation's intelligence community has \nthe collection and analytic expertise required to confront our greatest \nchallenges no matter from which quarter they appear. While many are \nconcerned about the emergence of China as a peer competitor in the \nNorthern Pacific, we obviously still face the scourge of international \nterrorism, international criminal organizations and other transnational \nthreats. And, of course, there remains the perplexing problem of \ngathering intelligence against closed societies such as Iran and North \nKorea so called ``hard'' targets.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has both the distinct privilege and solemn \nobligations that come with being the first Director of National \nIntelligence. How he leads, how he manages the community, how he shapes \nhis role, the relationships he creates with the various agencies and \ntheir leaders will not only determine how effective he is in reforming \nour intelligence community but very likely how each of his successors \nwill approach the oversight of our intelligence community as well. And \nthe transformation he is charged with overseeing carries with it the \nfuture security of this Nation.\n  Our intelligence community professionals are the best in the world \nand every day they toil tirelessly, often unrecognized, in the shadows \nto keep this country safe. I believe they are eagerly looking for \nstrong leadership so they can move forward with the business of \nsecuring the country.\n  It has been said that ``A leader takes people where they want to go. \nA great leader takes people where they don't necessarily want to go but \nought to be.'' I believe that John Negroponte possesses the experience \nand leadership necessary to take this Nation's 15 intelligence agencies \nand the thousands of dedicated professionals in those agencies who toil \nto protect us all to where they ought to be.\n  He has demonstrated a recognition of the need to refocus our \nintelligence community, so that disparate intelligence agencies are \nworking together more cooperatively, so that information access is \nimproved to enable all relevant agencies to provide necessary input, \nand so that the intelligence products provided to national policy \nmakers are not only timely but reflect the best judgment of the \nentirety of the intelligence community.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has taken on some of the toughest and most \nimportant jobs in our diplomatic service in his long and illustrious \ncareer as a Foreign Service Officer. He has been nominated for and \nconfirmed as Chief of Mission in four embassies and as the President's \nrepresentative to the United Nations. He has served in leadership \npositions within the Department of State and as a security advisor in \nthe White House. John Negroponte has demonstrated the resolve and \nability to take on tough management and policy positions and to perform \nadmirably.\n  In the past 3 years, there have been four major investigations that \nhave concluded that the time has come for significant reform in the \nintelligence community. In December 2002, the primary recommendation of \nthe Joint Inquiry into the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001 was \nthat Congress should amend the National Security Act of 1947 to create \na statutory Director of National Intelligence to be the President's \nprincipal advisor on intelligence with the full range of management, \nbudgetary, and personnel responsibilities needed to make the entire \nU.S. Intelligence Community operate as a coherent whole.\n  Last July, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued its \nReport on the U.S. Intelligence Community's Prewar Intelligence \nAssessments on Iraq that found that although the Director of Central \nIntelligence was supposed to act as head of both the CIA and the \nintelligence community, for the most part he acted only as the head of \nthe CIA to the detriment of the intelligence product provided to \nNational policymakers.\n  Later that month, the 9/11 Commission issued their report on the \nterrorist attacks and also recommended that the current position of \nDirector of Central Intelligence should be replaced by a National \nIntelligence Director with two main areas of responsibility: to oversee \nNational intelligence centers and to manage the National intelligence \nprogram and oversee the agencies that contribute to it.\n  Finally, earlier this month the President's Commission on the \nIntelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of \nMass Destruction found the Intelligence Community is ``fragmented, \nloosely managed, and poorly coordinated; the 15 intelligence \norganizations are a `community' in name only and rarely act with a \nunity of purpose.'' They also concluded that the Director of National \nIntelligence will make our intelligence efforts better coordinated, \nmore efficient, and more effective.\n  Clearly, with this many investigations and Commissions arriving at \nthe same conclusions time and again, for the sake and safety of the \nNation we must begin the transformation of the fifteen agencies tasked \nwith collecting and analyzing intelligence into a single, coordinated \ncommunity with the agility to predict, respond to and overcome the \nthreats our Nation will face. The confirmation of the first Director of \nNational Intelligence is the first step in executing this extremely \ncomplex undertaking and time is of the essence. Indeed, I cannot recall \na time when a nominee has come before the Senate with the entire \ncommunity they have been nominated to lead in the midst of such \nsweeping transformation.\n  And once again, I believe the President has made an excellent choice \nin John Negroponte to lead the intelligence community through such a \ntransformation.\n  I look forward to working with him in the coming years as we shape \nour intelligence community into a cohesive whole and as he defines the \nrole of Director of National Intelligence. With a strong DNI and a \nfocused intelligence team, our Nation will be safer. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the confirmation of John Negroponte \nthe first Director of National Intelligence.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the successes of the intelligence community \nare never really known to the American public. But the spectacular \nfailures of the last few years have been apparent to us all. Blue-\nribbon panels, presidential commissions, and common sense have all told \nus that the intelligence community needs reform. In recent months, with \naction by Congress and the administration, we've begun to see progress. \nWith the vote on John Negroponte's nomination today, we will take an \nimportant step in giving life to the structural reforms we've debated \nfor so many months.\n  John Negroponte faces a daunting challenge as the country's first \nDirector of National Intelligence. It will be his responsibility to \nmake intelligence reform a reality, to break-down the barriers between \nintelligence agencies, and to restore the credibility of the American \nintelligence community. There once was a time where the word of the \nPresident of the United States was enough to reassure world leaders. \nAfter the intelligence failures of the last few years, that is no \nlonger true.\n  In his confirmation hearings, Mr. Negroponte identified ways to \nimprove the intelligence process--formalizing lessons-learned exercises \nacross the community; utilizing ``Team B'' analyses to avoid self-\nreinforcing analysis premised on faulty assumptions; improving inter-\nagency and community-wide cooperation; and removing barriers between \nforeign and domestic intelligence. He must also be able to work \neffectively with Secretary Rumsfeld and the Department of Defense--and \nits 80 percent of the intelligence\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\nbudget--to really reform the community. Many of us in Congress will \nsupport his efforts, and I urge President Bush to be steadfast in this \nregard as well.\n  But Mr. Negroponte's most immediate and urgent task will be to speak \ntruth to power. When the intelligence does not support the policy goals \nor ambitions of the administration, Mr. Negroponte must never flinch, \nnever waiver, never compromise one iota of his integrity or the \nintegrity of the intelligence. He must also be willing to push analysts \nto challenge assumptions, consider alternatives, and follow the \nevidence wherever it may lead them. And when they do, he must back them \nwith the full authority of his office.\n  Today we face many threats, the dangerous legacy of the Cold War in \nvast nuclear arsenals, the spread of weapons of mass destruction, the \nspread of terrorism, lingering disputes in various regions of the \nworld, and new forces, like globalization, all crying out for \nleadership by the United States. The decisions policy makers make are \ninfluenced by many factors. But on issues of war and peace, on \nprotecting this country, on determining our long-term national security \nneeds and the direction of our foreign policy, there is no substitute \nfor intelligence that is accurate, timely, and trusted.\n  Mr. Negroponte will shape the role of Director of National \nIntelligence in fundamental ways. He will be judged on whether or not \nAmerica is safer at the end of his tenure than when he starts. For the \nsake of us all, I hope he succeeds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nAmbassador John D. Negroponte to be the first Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  This is not a moment without precedent in history. President \nRoosevelt faced a similar situation in 1941 when he had disparate \nintelligence and information gathering organizations within the \ngovernment, but did not have a single person in charge. President \nRoosevelt convinced a reluctant Colonel William J., Wild Bill, Donovan \nto be the first ``Coordinator of Information,'' an organization that \neventually became the Office of Strategic Services, OSS, and \nultimately, the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  I would like to read a quote from the book, ``Donovan of O.S.S.,'' by \nCorey Ford:\n\n       The appointment of Colonel Donovan as director of COI was \n     formally announced by executive order on July 11, 1941, and \n     his duties were defined in Roosevelt's own words: `To collect \n     and analyze all information and data which may bear upon \n     national security, to correlate such information and data and \n     make the same available to the President and to such \n     departments and officials of the Government as may the \n     President may determine, and to carry out when request by the \n     President such supplementary activities as may facilitate the \n     securing of information important for national security not \n     now available to the Government.'\n       The directive was purposely obscure in its wording, due to \n     the secret and potentially offensive nature of the agency's \n     functions; and the other intelligence organizations, jealous \n     of their prerogatives, took advantage of the vague \n     phraesology to set loose a flock of rumors that Donovan was \n     to be the Heinrich Himmler of an American Gestapo, the \n     Goebbels of a controlled press, a super-spy over Hoover's G-\n     men and the Army and Navy, the head of a grand strategy board \n     which would dictate even to the General Staff. In vain, the \n     President reiterated that Donovan's work, `is not intended to \n     supersede or to duplicate or to involve any direction of or \n     interference with the activities of the General Staff, the \n     regular intelligence services, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, or of other existing agencies.' The \n     bureaucratic war was on.\n       It was a war all too familiar to Washington, the dog-eat-\n     dog struggle among government departments to preserve their \n     own areas of power.\n\n  Ambassador Negroponte and General Michael Hayden, USAir Force, his \ndeputy, face a similar situation today, and I wish them well.\n  Some have said the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act \nof 2004 uses similarly ``vague phraseology'' in describing the \nauthorities and responsibilities of the new Director of National \nIntelligence. Some say that Roosevelt was intentionally vague to allow \nthe strong personality of Wild Bill Donovan to make this new \nintelligence organization work.\n  I think we have two very strong personalities in Ambassador \nNegroponte and General Hayden who are up to the task and will make this \nnew Office of National Intelligence work. Their work will be even more \neffective as they forge strong alliances with their colleagues in other \ndepartments of Government.\n  As Ambassador Negroponte begins this important effort, I know he is \nmindful on the balance that must be maintained between the needs of \nnational policy makers, military commanders on distant battlefields, \nand local and national homeland security officials, who are all charged \nwith the safety and security of the American homeland. The support \nthese elements enjoy today has not always been the case. When General \nNorman Schwarzkopf testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee \nin June 1991 regarding lesson learned during the first Persian Gulf \nWar, he told the committee that responsive national intelligence \nsupport has been unsatisfactory from his perspective as the theater \ncommander in charge of combat operations. Clearly, much has changed \nsince 1991, but we must all remain vigilant in ensuring that \nintelligence support for our men and women in uniform is maintained and \nenhanced.\n  Ambassador Negroponte has a strong record of public service as the \nU.S. Ambassador to Honduras, Mexico, the Philippines, the United \nNations, and most recently, Iraq. He has a great reputation as a \nproblem solver who can be counted on for the epitome of candor and \nintegrity.\n  John Negroponte has served his Nation faithfully and well. His \nwillingness to take on this daunting challenge is a testament to a man \nwho understands service to Nation and has, once again, answered the \ncall to serve. We are fortunate to have a citizen of such character to \nundertake this important and challenging task of bringing our \nIntelligence Community together as a coherent, well-coordinated entity.\n  I strongly support confirmation of Ambassador John D. Negroponte to \nbe the first Director of National Intelligence, and hope the spirit of \nWild Bill Donovan guides and inspires his efforts.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise to give my enthusiastic vote \nof support for President Bush's nominee to be this Nation's first \nDirector of National Intelligence. I have known Ambassador Negroponte \nfor over 20 years, and his professional career as one of our Nation's \nbest diplomats began 20 years earlier. And rarely have I voted in \nsupport of a Presidential nominee with greater confidence. I trust that \nmy colleagues will lend their support unanimously to the President's \nselection for a position we are anxious to fill.\n  As he assumes the position we created last year to unify the \nintelligence community's capabilities as they have never been unified \nbefore, I offer Ambassador Negroponte my complete support, with three \npoints to consider.\n  First, as I have told the nominee, this will be the most difficult \njob he will ever hold. And I say this to the man who has just returned \nfrom serving as our first ambassador to a liberated Iraq. During \nAmbassador Negroponte's nomination hearing two weeks ago, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, who \nalso has my greatest respect, while reviewing the job requirements for \nthe new position of DNI, candidly asked the nominee: ``Why would you \nwant this job?''\n  The answer, for those who know him, is that Ambassador Negroponte has \nalways responded to the call by his country to take on difficult \nchallenges. And we in the Senate have supported him by confirming him, \nto date, seven times.\n  Second, as I also told the nominee, and I have said to my colleagues: \nOsama bin Laden is not quaking in his hideaway because we have created \nthe position of Director of National Intelligence. Let us be candid to \nourselves about this. Too often in Washington, a bureaucratic response \nis mistaken for a solution. I hope we all recognize, after the years of \ndiscussing reform, that the legislation we passed last year initiates \nthe beginning, not the end of reform.\n  And this leads to my third point. Ambassador Negroponte's mission, \nonce we confirm him, is to take the elements of the intelligence \ncommunity and de-Balkanize them. His mission will be to create a whole \nthat is greater than the sum of the intelligence community parts. He \nwill do\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nthis by achieving what we call jointness between all parts of the \ncommunity. When he does that--and this will have to do as much with \ncreating new doctrine, and creating community culture that integrates \nthis doctrine--then will our already impressive elements we have in our \ncommunity be able to advance our security. Only then will we be \ncreating the 21st century global intelligence capabilities that will \nmake bin Laden's inevitable successors and wannabees sweat and run.\n  In my conversations with Ambassador Negroponte about his new brief, I \nhave shared some of my ideas with him, and I have found him to be \nwelcoming of these and all ideas. He understands the problems we face, \nas he has been a consumer of intelligence for most of his career, and \nhe has spent his last tour in Iraq confronting the challenge of \nmultiple armed groups dedicated to collaborating against us. I believe \nhe knows what we need, and I know he is determined to take the \nimpressive technological and human capacities already in place in our \nintelligence community and take it to the level necessary to give the \nAmerican public a strategic intelligence capability we need and must \nhave.\n  I believe Ambassador Negroponte has always served this country \nhonorably. As we confirm him today, which I trust we will, I offer him \nmy support and, once again, gratitude for choosing to serve his country \nin one of the most challenging positions in our history.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, one of my top priorities is the real \nreform of our Nation's intelligence. The Intelligence Reform Act of \n2004 was a first step toward transforming the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity. Information sharing will be strengthened, while diverse \nopinion and independent analysis will be protected.\n  The single most important provision in the act was the creation of a \nDirector of National Intelligence, who would have authority, \nresponsibility, and financial control over the entire intelligence \ncommunity.\n  The President has nominated an experienced diplomat to be Director of \nNational Intelligence. Ambassador John D. Negroponte has worked hard \nfor his country and has made personal sacrifices. When his country \ncalled, he has exposed himself to hardship and danger most notably in \nVietnam and in Iraq.\n  He has also had extensive exposure to U.S. intelligence products and \noperations. He had intelligence coordination responsibilities in \nWashington on the National Security Council. He recently had \nresponsibility for leading the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad during a time \nwhen intelligence on the Iraqi insurgency had the highest priority.\n  Yet I have serious concerns with certain aspects of Ambassador \nNegroponte's record--particularly his actions while he was ambassador \nto Honduras. There is a serious discrepancy between his description of \nthe Honduran government's human rights record during those years and \nthat of the CIA Inspector General and nongovernmental organizations. He \nhas yet to show complete candor in discussing U.S. activities there \nwith the Congress.\n  I believe that Ambassador Negroponte could have been more outspoken \nin reporting from his vantage point at the United Nations in the winter \nof 2003--when our country was on the verge of war.\n  Despite these concerns, I will vote for the confirmation of \nAmbassador Negroponte. I am encouraged by his responses to my questions \nduring hearings before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n  In a very important exchange, he provided assurances that he will \n``speak truth to power.'' In response to my questions, Ambassador \nNegroponte said he would make sure that reliability problems with \nsources are put before decisionmakers. He agreed to explore mechanisms \nlike the State Department's Dissent Channel to encourage those who see \nyellow flashing lights to express their views to senior officials and \nto protect dissenters from political retaliation. And he said that he \nhimself would be taking the ``unvarnished truth'' to the President. He \nalso said that all organizations under his purview will obey the law \nand that there will be full accountability.\n  These assurances are critical. My vote to confirm Ambassador \nNegroponte is based on them. As a member of the Senate Select \nIntelligence Committee, I will be watching closely to see that they are \nhonored and will do what I can to contribute to Ambassador Negroponte's \nsuccess as the first Director of National Intelligence.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to support the nomination \nof Ambassador John Negroponte to the post of Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. Negroponte is superbly qualified for this new and challenging \nposition. I applaud the President on his choice of candidate. Last \nweek, Mr. Negroponte was approved by the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence. I expect he will be confirmed with overwhelming, \nbipartisan support here on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. Negroponte's career in public service spans four decades and \nthree continents. He has served in Europe, Asia and Latin America. He \nspeaks five languages fluently, and has won Senate confirmation for 7 \nprevious posts. He is widely regarded as one of our most distinguished \nand respected public officials.\n  Among his many career highlights, Mr. Negroponte has served as \nAmbassador to Honduras, Ambassador to Mexico, Ambassador to the \nPhilippines, and Ambassador to the United Nations. He has served under \nmultiple presidents, Republican and Democrat.\n  In 2004, President Bush nominated Mr. Negroponte to serve as our \nAmbassador to the newly liberated Iraq.\n  As his background attests, Mr. Negroponte has tackled many difficult \nand sensitive missions. He has also earned a reputation as a skilled \nmanager--skills he will surely need in the job ahead.\n  As Director of National Intelligence, Mr. Negroponte will be \nresponsible for overseeing the entire intelligence community. It will \nbe Mr. Negroponte's job to keep America safe by bridging the gaps \nbetween our 15 intelligence agencies and improving information sharing \nbetween agencies.\n  He will determine the annual budgets for all National intelligence \nagencies and offices, and direct how these funds are spent. The \nDirector will also report directly to the President.\n  It is a tough job and a tremendous responsibility. But I am confident \nthat Mr. Negroponte will work hard to make the necessary reforms to \nhelp keep America safe.\n  We learned on 9-11 that the enemy is deadly and determined. He \ndoesn't wear a uniform or march under a recognized flag. He hides in \nthe shadows where he plots his next attack.\n  Dangerous weapons proliferation must be stopped. Terrorist \norganizations must be destroyed. And we must have an intelligence \ncommunity that works together to confront these very real dangers so \nthat we never suffer another 9-11 or worse.\n  I look forward to Mr. Negroponte's swift confirmation. He has served \nour country with honor and distinction over many years. America is \nfortunate to have a public servant of his caliber working hard on our \nbehalf.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of John Negroponte to be our Nation's first Director of \nNational Intelligence. This is a historic moment, and a critical step \ntoward making our nation more secure. But it is also only the beginning \nof what will be a long and challenging effort to reform and improve our \nintelligence capabilities.\n  It is worth recalling how we got here. The establishment of the \nDirector of National Intelligence would not have happened had it not \nbeen for the patriotism and passion of some remarkable Americans. Let \nme begin with the families of the victims of 9/11 who managed to turn \ntheir grief into real, effective action. The Family Steering Committee \nand, in particular, four 9/11 widows from my State who called \nthemselves the ``Jersey Girls,'' fought for real answers. They pushed \nfor the creation of the 9/11 Commission, whose recommendations included \nthe position for which Mr. Negroponte is being confirmed today. They \nalso insisted that the administration cooperate fully with the \nCommission as it sought a full accounting of the terrorist attack. They \ndid all this for one reason: they wanted America to be safer than it \nwas on the day they lost their loved ones.\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\n  We also owe an enormous debt to the 9/11 Commission, led by former \nNew Jersey Governor Tom Kean and former Congressman Lee Hamilton. The \nCommission's hard work, persistence, intellectual honesty, and \npolitical neutrality brought about something truly incredible: a \nnational consensus. The Commission's meticulous and thorough study of \nthe events leading up to and including September 11 and its wise and \nsuccinct recommendations gave us an understanding of the past and a \npath forward. And, by involving the American people in their \ndeliberations, they helped generate public support for much needed \nreform.\n  It is almost impossible to overstate the challenges ahead for the new \nDirector of National Intelligence. The intelligence failures that led \nto the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, happened in part because \nof a lack of coordination among our intelligence agencies. It is the \nDNI's job to resolve this problem. Mr. Negroponte will need the \nPresident's support. He will also need Congress' support. He has mine.\n  The DNI will also have to correct the intelligence failures that led \nto the war in Iraq. That includes ensuring that intelligence analyses \nare objective and that those analyses are used appropriately by policy \nmakers. The DNI will need to speak truth to power, to tell policymakers \nthe hard truth about what we know and what we don't know. Intelligence \nmust guide policy, and not vice versa.\n  Our intelligence serves many purposes, from informing foreign policy \nto supporting tactical military decisions. The new DNI will be \nresponsible for guiding our priorities. But this position would not \nhave been created had we not been attacked on our soil, on September \n11, 2001. The intelligence community has new consumers: the Department \nof Homeland Security, Federal, State and local government officials, \nlaw enforcement and our Nation's first responders. It is critical that \nthese people have the information they need to protect us.\n  Mr. Negroponte is highly qualified for this position and I am proud \nto support his confirmation. But he cannot do this alone. This and \nfuture administrations and the Congress must stay engaged in and remain \ncommitted to the hard work of intelligence reform.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthis historic nomination of Ambassador John Negroponte to be the first \nDirector of National Intelligence named under the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004--the most sweeping reform of the \nintelligence community in over 50 years. With this appointment, we will \nfinally have a single official with the authority, responsibility, and \naccountability to lead a more unified and more integrated intelligence \ncommunity capable of avoiding the unacceptable intelligence failures \nrecounted in excruciating detail by the independent 9/11 Commission \nand, more recently, by the President's WMD Commission.\n  I am confident Ambassador Negroponte is up to this admittedly \ndifficult task. With a career in public service spanning over four \ndecades, Ambassador Negroponte has demonstrated the commitment and \ndetermination this post demands. His service in numerous Foreign \nService posts across Asia, Europe, and Latin America--and most recently \nas the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq--has certainly provided him with the \nglobal perspective of our intelligence needs that the position \nrequires. And, having served in senior positions here in Washington at \nthe State Department and at the National Security Council, Ambassador \nNegroponte has developed the bureaucratic skills that the DNI must \nexercise in order to be effective.\n  The most important factor in whether Ambassador Negroponte--indeed, \nwhether the entire intelligence reform effort--succeeds, is the degree \nof support provided by President Bush and the White House in the early \nbut formative stages of this process. The path toward reform is always \na difficult one, particularly with the likely array of bureaucratic and \ninstitutional obstacles the DNI is likely to confront. As the WMD \nCommission candidly recognized, ``The Intelligence Community is a \nclosed world, and many insiders admitted to us that it has an almost \nperfect record of resisting external recommendations.'' It should come \nas no surprise that the array of strong statutory authorities provided \nto the DNI under the legislation can, in and of itself, only accomplish \nso much; implementation will now be the crucial test, and the President \nmust show the same level of commitment he demonstrated during the final \npush to pass the intelligence reform legislation in the last Congress.\n  I am encouraged in this regard by the President's remarks in \nannouncing the nomination of Ambassador Negroponte. President Bush \nsaid:\n\n       In the war against terrorists who target innocent civilians \n     and continue to seek weapons of mass murder, intelligence is \n     our first line of defense. If we're going to stop the \n     terrorists before they strike, we must ensure that our \n     intelligence agencies work as a single, unified enterprise. \n     And that's why I supported, and Congress passed, reform \n     legislation creating the job of Director of National \n     Intelligence.\n       As DNI, John will lead a unified intelligence community, \n     and will serve as the principle advisor to the President on \n     intelligence matters. He will have the authority to order the \n     collection of new intelligence, to ensure the sharing of \n     information among agencies, and to establish common standards \n     for the intelligence community's personnel. It will be John's \n     responsibility to determine the annual budgets for all \n     national intelligence agencies and offices and to direct how \n     these funds are spent. Vesting these authorities in a single \n     official who reports directly to me will make our \n     intelligence efforts better coordinated, more efficient, and \n     more effective.\n\n  Unfortunately, we had no single official who effectively forged unity \nof effort across the intelligence community prior to September 11. We \nhad no quarterback. Prior to this legislation, the Director of Central \nIntelligence (DCI) had three jobs: No. 1. principal intelligence \nadvisor to the President; No. 2. head of the CIA; and No. 3. head of \nthe intelligence community. As the 9/11 Commission concluded: ``No \nrecent DCI has been able to do all three effectively. Usually what \nloses out is management of the intelligence community, a difficult task \neven in the best case because the DCI's current authorities are weak. \nWith so much to do, the DCI often has not used even the authority he \nhas.''\n\n  The new Director of National Intelligence has two main \nresponsibilities: to head the intelligence community and to serve as \nprincipal intelligence advisor to the President. As principal advisor \nto the President, the DNI is responsible--and accountable--for ensuring \nthat the President is properly briefed on intelligence priorities and \nactivities. The CIA Director will now report to the DNI, who is not \nresponsible for managing the day to day activities of that agency while \nalso heading the intelligence community. In fact, the legislation \nspecifies that the Office of the DNI may not even be co-located with \nthe CIA or any other element of the intelligence community after \nOctober 1, 2008.\n  As head of the intelligence community, the DNI will have--and must \neffectively use--the wide range of strong budget, personnel, tasking, \nand other authorities detailed in the legislation to forge the unity of \neffort needed against the threats of this new century. I am pleased \nthat Ambassador Negroponte, appearing before the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, indicated he has heeded the advice from many \nquarters, including the President's WMD Commission, to push the \nenvelope with respect to his new authorities.\n  Perhaps the most significant of these authorities is the DNI's \ncontrol over national intelligence funding, now known as the National \nIntelligence Program NIP. Money equals power in Washington, or to \nparaphrase one of the witnesses who testified before the Senate \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee as we drafted the \nintelligence reform legislation, former DCI James Woolsey: ``The Golden \nRule in Washington is that he who has the gold, makes the rules.'' For \ninstance, with respect to budget development, the bill authorizes the \nDNI to ``develop and determine'' the NIP budget--which means that the \nDNI is the decision-maker concerning the intelligence budget and does \nnot share this authority with any department head.\n  Once Congress passes the national intelligence budget, the DNI must \n``ensure the effective execution'' of the NIP appropriation across the \nentire intelligence community whether the funds are for the CIA, NSA, \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any element of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\nThe Director of the Office of Management and Budget must apportion \nthose funds at the ``exclusive direction'' of the DNI. The DNI is \nfurther authorized to ``direct'' the allotment and allocation of those \nappropriations, and department comptrollers must then carry out their \nresponsibilities ``in an expeditious manner.'' In sum, the DNI controls \nhow national intelligence funding is spent across the executive branch, \nregardless of the department in which any particular intelligence \nelement resides.\n  In order to marshal the necessary resources to address higher \npriority intelligence activities, the DNI has significantly enhanced \nauthorities to transfer funds and personnel from one element of the \nintelligence community to another. And, in addition to these budget and \ntransfer authorities, the legislation provides the DNI with many new \nand increased authorities by which to effectively manage the sprawling \nintelligence community and force greater integration and cooperation \namong intelligence agencies. The DNI has the power to develop personnel \npolicies and programs, for example, to foster increased ``jointness'' \nacross the intelligence community--like the Goldwater-Nichols Act \naccomplished in the military context. The DNI also has the authority \nto exercise greater decision-making with respect to acquisitions of \nmajor systems, such as satellites, to task intelligence collection and \nanalysis, and to concur in the nominations or appointments of senior \nintelligence officials at the Departments of Defense, Homeland \nSecurity, Treasury, State, and Energy, the FBI, and elsewhere across \nthe executive branch.\n\n  More important than any individual authority, however, is the sum \ntotal. There is no longer any doubt as to who is in charge of, or who \nis accountable for, the performance of the United States intelligence \ncommunity. It is the DNI. Until exercised in practice, however, these \nauthorities are simply the words of a statute. And, unless exercised, \nthey will atrophy. Timidity, weakness, even passivity are not an \noption. History will judge harshly a DNI who squanders this opportunity \nto spread meaningful and lasting reform across the intelligence \ncommunity. And our national security depends upon it.\n  I fully anticipate that Ambassador Negroponte will rise to the \noccasion. He must, and I believe he will, hit the ground running, \nboldly face the inevitable challenges and frustrations that lie ahead, \nand aggressively assert the authorities with which he has been \nprovided. But the DNI will not be alone. With the full support of the \nPresident, the Joint Intelligence Community Council--composed of the \nSecretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, and \nthe Attorney General--will advise the DNI and make sure the DNI's \nprograms, policies, and directives are executed within their respective \ndepartments in a timely manner. And, if confirmed, the President's \nnominee for Principal Deputy DNI, NSA Director Lieutenant General \nMichael Hayden, will be a most valuable asset in leading the reform \neffort.\n  We have largely provided Ambassador Negroponte with the flexibility \nto establish the Office of the DNI as he sees fit in order to \naccomplish the goal of reform. In addition to his Principal Deputy, he \nmay appoint as many as four other deputies with the duties, \nresponsibilities, and authorities he deems appropriate. And, in \naddition to the National Counterterrorism Center, which is specifically \nmandated under the legislation, Ambassador Negroponte is authorized to \nestablish national intelligence centers, apart from any individual \nintelligence agency, to drive community-wide all-source analysis and \ncollection on key intelligence priorities. These national intelligence \ncenters have significant potential to shift the center of gravity in \nthe intelligence community from individual stove-piped agencies toward \na mission-oriented integrated intelligence network.\n  In sum, we have provided Ambassador Negroponte with the tools to get \nthe job done. Now, with the backing of the President, he must use those \nauthorities to transform the intelligence community as envisioned by \nthe 9/11 Commission, expected by Congress, and needed for the security \nof the American people. On September 11, 2001, it became painfully \nevident that the threats we face as a nation had evolved, and that our \nnational security structure needed to evolve accordingly. Ambassador \nNegroponte will now have the opportunity to help our intelligence \ncommunity meet these new security challenges. I wish him well.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I speak today on the nomination of John \nNegroponte to be the first Director of National Intelligence. I want to \nexpress my full support for his confirmation.\n  John Negroponte is without question one of the most qualified public \nservants to fill this position. Over the past four decades he has \ncontinually worked to advance American policy both domestically and \nabroad.\n  He is a career diplomat and served in the United States Foreign \nService from 1960 to 1997. Among his most notable posts are Vietnam, \nthe Philippines, Honduras and Mexico.\n  After the Foreign Service, Mr. Negroponte was appointed as the U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations from September 2001 until June 2004. \nAfter that, he was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate as the first \nU.S. Ambassador to the new democratic Iraq.\n  Throughout his ambassadorship in Iraq, he received immense praise \neven from the harshest of critics for his removal of corruption in the \nreconstruction effort in Iraq. He later oversaw, what many deemed \nimpossible--the first successful Iraqi democratic elections. As we have \nseen through his leadership in Iraq, democracy has quickly taken root \nin the country and I believe it will continue to grow.\n  While the position of the Director of National Intelligence is new to \nour Government, I am confident that Mr. Negroponte will be successful \nin his endeavors to create a united intelligence entity. His experience \nand success in Iraq will serve him well in this new position.\n  Intelligence reform is an issue that we know all too well. It has \nbeen widely addressed in a variety of government bodies since September \n11 and continues to be the topic of many debates. I commend President \nBush in his efforts to directly confront this problem and to create a \nmore unified and efficient intelligence apparatus.\n  I am confident the Senate will overwhelming confirm Mr. Negroponte. I \nwish him well in his new position and with the daunting task of \nreforming our intelligence agencies. It is not an easy one. Despite \nthis challenge, I believe he will make our intelligence efforts better \ncoordinated, more efficient and more effective.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of Ambassador John \nNegroponte's nomination to be the first Director of National \nIntelligence.\n  I am pleased President Bush filled this critical position, and \npleased that the Senate Intelligence Committee moved with such dispatch \nto move him through the process. The Director of National Intelligence \nwill be one of the most difficult jobs in Washington. The director will \nhave to integrate information from 15 Federal agencies involved in \ngathering anti-terrorism information.\n  To break down the boundaries that fracture our intelligence \ncommunity, Negroponte will have to draw on more than 40 years' \nexperience in the Foreign Service. He served as U.S. ambassador to the \nUnited Nations from 2001 until last June, when he became the first U.S. \nambassador to Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War. He served in the U.S. \nEmbassy in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968 and has been ambassador to Mexico, \nthe Philippines and Honduras.\n  Mr. Negroponte is going to have to take advantage of his closeness \nwith President Bush to overcome some of the institutional inertia \nwithin the intelligence community. However, Negroponte cannot allow \nthat closeness to be a double-edged sword. The DNI needs to be an \nindependent voice. He needs to be able to withstand pressure from the \nPresident and report threats to American security as they are, not as \nothers want them to be.\n  I hope that Ambassador Negroponte will make it a priority to improve \nthe flow of accurate, timely and actionable intelligence to state and \nlocal security officials.\n  Right now, local officials--our front line in the battle for homeland \nsecurity--are getting intelligence from a dozen Federal terrorism watch \nlists. They get conflicting or incomplete\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\ndata or information that has no impact on them. They don't have the \nresources and expertise to process intelligence, form a complete \npicture of the threats they face, and what steps they can take.\n  We need to move away from a ``need-to-know'' intelligence culture to \na ``need-to-share'' one. State and local emergency officials represent \nmore than 800,000 sworn law enforment officers and 95 percent of \nAmerica's counter-terrorism capability. They are on the front lines of \nthe war on terror and they need better information in order to protect \nus.\n  I recognize that will be difficult to do, and I also recognize that \nthe solutions to this problem will require new thinking. But after \nserving with Colorado's police officers for 6 years as Attorney \nGeneral, I also know that the current system of information and \nintelligence sharing is absolutely insufficient. We can do better--and \nwe must do better.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nnominations of Ambassador John Negroponte and General Michael Hayden to \nbe Director and Deputy Director of National Intelligence.\n  The Senate's swift action on these two nominations is but the latest \nexample of how the Senate's confirmation process should work, and, for \nthe vast majority of President Bush's nominees, has worked.\n  It is really a simple formula for success: the President puts forward \ngood, qualified nominees and the committee of jurisdiction and the full \nSenate act expeditiously to approve the nomination.\n  In nominating Ambassador John Negroponte and General Michael Hayden \nto be Director and Deputy Director of National Intelligence, the \nPresident has put forward people with long years of dedicated service \nto the country.\n  Some have concerns about Ambassador Negroponte's previous service on \nLatin American issues, and these questions are certainly legitimate to \nexplore.\n  Ambassador Negroponte and General Hayden are men who have wide \nsupport across both parties, men who have proven track records as \nprofessional public servants.\n  Together, these two men are good choices for the important new \npositions at the top of our intelligence community.\n  With Ambassador Negroponte's recent experience in Iraq, long \nexperience in diplomatic matters, and years of time as a ``customer'' \nof intelligence, I am hopeful he will focus on improving how \nintelligence is used.\n  It is essential that he put in place the personnel and processes \nnecessary to help the intelligence community avoid future colossal \nfailures like Iraq, where in an effort to make the case for the use of \nforce there, the President and the intelligence community repeatedly \nasserted that Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction.\n  As has become increasingly clear over time, Saddam did not possess \nstockpiles of these terrible weapons and a number of questions have \nbeen raised about whether the administration shaped or misused the \navailable intelligence.\n  Never again should a Secretary of State be sent in front of the \nUnited Nations to make the President's case for war based on evidence \nthat was so terribly flawed.\n  If Ambassador Negroponte can prevent such misuse of intelligence, and \nspeak truth to power, he will be a successful Director.\n  If Ambassador Negroponte is to succeed in developing the right \nintelligence and ensuring that it is used properly, he will have to \ndramatically transform our intelligence agencies.\n  In the intelligence reform bill we passed last year, we demanded that \nsomeone take charge of improving the intelligence agencies' \nperformance. In that bill, we gave him the tools and the mandate \nneeded.\n  Working with his Deputy Director, General Hayden, who has nearly 3 \ndecades of experience in transforming intelligence as a military \nofficer, I expect Ambassador Negroponte to transform the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  The first step in this critical transformation must be to \ndramatically improve our intelligence collection capabilities, \nespecially our human intelligence efforts, against the 21st century \nthreats of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I hope these nominees will maximize their use of the strong, new \nauthorities Congress provided them in last year's bill. Our Nation's \nsecurity rests in large measure on their efforts. I wish them every \nsuccess in their endeavors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, if there is no other Member on our \nside who wishes to speak, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I may be the only one with time remaining and I yield back \nthe remainder of my time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I yield back all time on the pending \nnomination, other than the 5 minutes that will be reserved for Senator \nStevens; provided further that the vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination occur at 3:45 today. I further ask that at 3:30 today the \nSenate resume consideration of the emergency supplemental bill for the \nfinal 15 minutes of debate and that the votes scheduled on the two \namendments and final passage occur immediately following the vote on \nthe Negroponte nomination. I ask that all votes in the sequence after \nthe first be limited to 10 minutes in length and that there be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the votes. Finally, I ask \nunanimous consent that following this consent, the Senate proceed to a \nperiod for morning business with Senators permitted to speak for up to \n10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4074-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4074-S4076]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         THE BOLTON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in behalf of John \nBolton to be the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations. I \nknow this nomination is gaining controversy. Yet the more I listen to \nit, I realize there may be an attempt to kill his nomination from a \nthousand cuts.\n  It is not unusual in this town to see someone with a strong \npersonality being subject to all kinds of innuendo and charges and \nhearsay. Certainly all of these things warrant investigation so that \nthe Senate can perform its advise and consent duty. However, I think it \nis also very important we remember the President's right to nominate \nthe individuals he believes are important in order to pursue his \npolicies after his election, an election he earned at the ballot box, \nand the right conferred upon him by the Constitution.\n  I rise here not as an opponent of the United Nations, but as one \ndeeply disappointed in the United Nations in the 9 years in which I \nhave served as a Senator. The U.N. is going through a challenging \nperiod, one that is raising questions about its effectiveness and \nability to fulfill its mission on a global scale. New and unprecedented \nchallenges face the United States and our allies. We cannot solve all \nthe world's problems on our own. We need to continue to work with our \nallies to combat threats around the world, especially the threat of \nterrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction, for those two \nfactors in combination probably pose the greatest security threat to \nour Nation and the civilized world.\n  An efficient and effective United Nations can still play a valuable \nrole in world affairs. The U.N. demonstrated this by its response to \nthe tsunami disasters that befell Indonesia, India, Sri Lanka, Thailand \nand the other nations\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nin the Indian Ocean. The United Nations can still serve an integral \nhumanitarian function. Its success in coordinating relief efforts is \nhelping the region to recover from its tragedy. I am also pleased with \nthe U.N.'s establishment of new levels of oversight to monitor how \nenormous levels of humanitarian assistance are distributed to needy \npeople.\n  Unfortunately, the U.N. can, and should, and must be more and do \nmore. We have a United Nations that is tragically rife with corruption \nand mismanagement. It is an organization that is starting now to admit \nits problems. That is a positive. But it seems incapable of addressing \nthese issues in any meaningful way.\n  The international community has been rocked by scandals involving the \nUnited Nations. The most obvious example of its malfeasance, of course, \nis the Oil-for-Food Program. As you know, the U.N. was responsible for \noverseeing the Oil-for-Food Program, which was established to provide \nrelief to the Iraqi people suffering under Saddam Hussein's brutal \nregime. Instead, it allowed--and possibly even directed--the incredible \nscheme of kickbacks, bribes, and other financial crimes that may have \neven enriched some members of the U.N. bureaucracy.\n  The United Nations peacekeepers, sent to provide some semblance of \nsecurity to war-torn countries, have been accused of such crimes as \nrape, child molestation, and sexual abuse in the Democratic Republic of \nCongo, the Balkans, and in Haiti.\n  High-ranking United Nations officials have been accused of sexual \nharassment. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, was \nrecently removed from his post because of sexual harassment.\n  To tackle this challenge, on March 7, 2005, President Bush nominated \nJohn Bolton to be the Permanent United Nations Representative for the \nUnited States. I believe Mr. Bolton can help produce a more effective \nand efficient U.N., a stronger U.S.-U.N. relationship, and a U.N. that \nlives up to its founding principles and ideals.\n  I do not know Mr. Bolton. I have shaken has hand, I believe, on one \noccasion. But as I have reviewed his record of accomplishment and his \nanswers to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on which I once was \nprivileged to serve, it is clear to me he is intelligent. I believe he \nis honest. He is certainly candid. These are qualities I think that can \nhelp him help the United Nations.\n  When we think back on U.N. ambassadors from our Nation, those willing \nto shake things up have been most meaningful in helping the U.N. to \nlive up to its high purposes. The name of our former colleague, Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, comes to mind. Jeanne Kirkpatrick also comes to mind. \nThese are two who were not afraid to step on toes or to do what was \nnecessary to get the job done and help the U.N. to change.\n  I believe John Bolton's personality, while not perfect for everyone, \nwill work in a manner that will create change leading to needed \nreforms. Frankly what you need in this capacity is probably a strong \nbackbone more than a winning personality. He understands the strengths \nand especially the weaknesses of the U.N. At no time in the history of \nthe United Nations has reform been as needed as right now. The United \nStates, as the leading contributor to the United Nations' budget, must \ntake the lead in setting forth the necessary reforms.\n  The United Nations is losing respect, not only in the United States \nbut throughout the world. The United Nations has a serious legitimacy \nproblem. I remember hearing the Secretary General saying legitimacy \ncomes uniquely from the United Nations. I wish it did. But it does not. \nLegitimacy comes from democracy and processes that are open and \ntransparent and free from corruption and, when corruption is found, \nrooted out through the process of law.\n  The Security Council--and I think the American people understand \nthis--is not a place where Americans can find security. In some of the \nworst cases of genocide in our planet, it has been idle, unable, \nunwilling, and too gridlocked to stand up to some of the worst human \ncrime in our time.\n\n  It sets high standards for itself and then sits on its hands while \ngenocide occurs in places such as Rwanda and in the Sudan. Countries \nthat harass their people, that imprison those who clamor for democratic \nrights, that thwart all efforts at civilized behavior, have the same \nvoting power as those with free, democratic societies.\n  I wish it was the United Democratic Nations but, it tragically is \nnot. Legitimacy is given to the United Nations from countries such as \nthe United States. We do not need a stamp of approval from the U.N. to \nact, but the U.N. does need the stamp of approval from its member \nstates before it can act.\n  How can one not doubt the legitimacy of the United Nations when a \nhuman rights stalwart such as Libya, or Cuba, is appointed to chair the \nHuman Rights Commission and the United States is removed? Or Iran is \nchairing the Disarmament Commission? The question answers itself.\n  With the 60th anniversary of the United Nations approaching this \nsummer, though, we have a real opportunity to encourage the U.N. to \nchange its ways, to live up to its founding ideals. The United States \nmust take the lead in helping to reform the United Nations. This is the \nonly way the U.N. can fulfill its original promise of promoting \ninternational peace and security.\n  John Bolton may or may not be the perfect nominee. That is not my \npoint. But I think he can be effective simply because he can be \nconfrontational. Under Secretary Bolton has, with all the slings and \narrows directed his way, served his country with honor and distinction \nat many different times. He has been an effective diplomat, enjoying a \nstrong record of success, and has demonstrated his enthusiasm for \nworking with other countries to meet common challenges.\n  When one reviews John Bolton's credentials, it is clear he is \nextremely qualified to be United States Ambassador to the United \nNations. I say that without any commentary at all on his personality. \nAs an Assistant Secretary for International Organizations from 1989 to \n1993 in the first Bush administration, Under Secretary Bolton worked \nfor Secretary James Baker on U.N. reform matters and on the repayment \nof arrearages and assessments.\n  While serving as the Assistant Secretary for International \nOrganizations, he detailed his concept of a unitary U.N. that sought to \nensure management and budget reforms that impacted the entire U.N. \nsystem, not only the U.N. Secretariat. This is truly a forward thinking \ninitiative. This is the type of creativity and resourcefulness we need \nin order to address the enormous problems within the United Nations.\n  In 1991, Under Secretary Bolton was the principal architect behind \nthe initiatives that finally led the United Nations General Assembly to \nrepeal the resolution that equated Zionism and racism, one of the more \nnotorious and heinous resolutions ever passed by the United Nations. \nImagine this: The United Nations, created out of the ashes of World War \nII, passing a resolution in 1975 equating Zionism with racism and \nrefusing for nearly 20 years to repeal that appalling notion.\n  During his time out of Government, Mr. Bolton served the United \nNations on a pro bono basis between 1997 and 2000, as an assistant to \nformer Secretary of State Baker in his capacity as the Secretary \nGeneral's personal envoy for Western Sahara, working to resolve the \ndispute over that territory--quite an effort from someone who does not \nbelieve in the power of multilateralism and international \norganizations, which is alleged against him but is not true.\n  For the past 4 years he has served as the Under Secretary of State \nfor Arms Control and International Security Affairs. Under Secretary \nBolton led the efforts to implement the President's agenda to counter \nnonproliferation, including the reform of the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency.\n  He also shaped the administration's approaches to countering the \nthreat of WMD proliferation and, most importantly, the proliferation \nsecurity initiative, a program that led directly to the discovery of \nLibya's nuclear program and its subsequent disarmament.\n  John Bolton is the best candidate to help usher in this needed reform \nbecause he is the one the President nominated and he has a long record \nof\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\nachievement. He knows the United Nations. He knows the changes that \nneed to be made, and with his prior experience he can work with fellow \nmembers of the U.N. and to implement the necessary reforms.\n  My mother used to tell me when I was a little boy, got in trouble and \npunished: Son, it is better to be trusted than loved. Frankly, if Mr. \nBolton is feared, while not loved, he may do more good than if he is \nloved and getting along with all. With all the problems illustrated \nwith the United Nations, why would we want to send someone to New York \nwho is more interested in the status quo than with engaging this \ninstitution with real reform for its organizations.\n  Again, I don't know Mr. Bolton personally. His personality is \nprobably much different than my own. But I do know the President has a \nright to appoint whom he will appoint. Unless something is unearthed \nthat disqualifies him because of his conduct, then all the innuendo, \nthe hearsay, and the charges made against him that are ``he said, she \nsaid'' need to be understood in the long tradition in this town of \nkilling one by 1,000 cuts, simply for political gain.\n  We owe this country and especially the United Nations, something \nbetter than an effort of blood sport in the Senate. Unless something is \nquickly unearthed about Mr. Bolton, I ask my colleagues to advise and \nconsent on this nomination and to confirm him as quickly as possible \nbecause the work of reform at the United Nations is long overdue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent--I will not speak that long--to \nproceed for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent my comments be separated. I will \nmake a few comments about Secretary Bolton and ask that they are \nseparated and appear separately in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will say a few words about Secretary \nBolton.\n  The Senator from Oregon and I are good friends and we have known each \nother a long time in the Senate and have worked together on a number of \nissues. As he well knows, the issue that defines the Bolton nomination \nis not politics. It is not ``death by 1,000 cuts.'' It is an \nexamination of the record of an individual who has been nominated for \none of the largest embassies in the world, one of the most important \nspokesperson jobs in the world, one of the most important diplomatic \njobs in the world.\n  It is vital, in the aftermath of Secretary Powell's testimony to the \nUnited Nations--which he now has publicly acknowledged was in error, on \nthe basis of intelligence that was erroneous--that we send a message to \nthe world about the credibility of that spokesperson and the United \nStates itself. If that spokesperson comes to the job with a background \nof having interfered with the work of analysts in the State Department \nin the research and the intelligence research department, or if that \nperson comes to the job with proof that there is, in fact, a \nretribution system for not providing the intelligence according to what \nthat person wanted--not according to what the intelligence was--that is \na problem. It is a serious problem.\n  If the nominee was not candid with the committee under oath before \nwhich he appeared, that is a serious problem. It is not politics. There \nwill be a lot more time to discuss this over the course of the next \ndays. The committee, to its credit, is going to do what is appropriate, \nwhich is examine these issues. Every member of the committee is duty-\nbound and will review that evidence with diligence, an open mind, and \nhonesty. That is all we can ask.\n  We should not be reducing every question, particularly legitimate \nquestions, to the sense of politics. It is a mistake. It is a mistake \nfor the quality of the government we are trying to provide the American \npeople. It is a mistake with respect to our constitutional obligations \nwhen we go up to this desk and raise our hand and swear to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  It is not the first time in American history a nominee has been \nquestioned--Democrat or Republican. It is appropriate to perform that \nfunction.\n  I heard colleagues on the committee say in the beginning, this is \nonly one offense. If there were a pattern, I would be disturbed by \nthis. Lo and behold, in the next day, a pattern appeared, and all of a \nsudden the ``pattern'' people disappeared. It was not a question of if \nthere is a pattern, it was now, well, the President has a right to make \nhis choice. Another reason and rationale was found.\n  I don't even know why we get into such a partisan tizzy about it. The \nother side of the aisle ought to care as much as we do who is there or \nwho is not there. We have had nominees in the course of time that I \nhave been here who have not been confirmed or who were not confirmable, \nsome of whom were delayed endlessly. I remember what a good friend of \nmine, Richard Holbrooke, went through in the process of his nomination. \nSenator Helms had him jumping through hoops for months looking at his \nfinancial records and his transactions, none of which occurred in the \ncourse of his public business, but, nevertheless, that is what \nhappened. And he patiently went through it. And we patiently worked \nthrough it. Ultimately he was confirmed and I think he did an \noutstanding job for the country as a consequence of that.\n  So I think it is time to find a different path here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4076-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4076-S4078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             NUCLEAR OPTION\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak about the second issue I would \nlike to talk about.\n  The Republican nuclear option has been discussed endlessly on \neditorial pages, talk radio, and here in this Chamber. The ongoing \ndebate is about much more than Senate procedure. At its core is a \ndebate, really, about where we are headed in our relationship between \neach other, Republicans and Democrats, leaders all sworn to uphold the \nConstitution and with the responsibility to try to lead this Nation in \ndifficult times and find the common ground and build a consensus for \nour country.\n  At its core is a debate about how we live out our own democracy in \nAmerica. Beneath it are questions about how this city, the Nation's \nCapital, is functioning today, how we relate to each other, how our \ncommittees work, how the Senate itself functions. It appears as if we \nare headed in a direction that ultimately clashes with the real will \nand needs of the American people. That is what this is really all \nabout.\n  The fact that we are even talking about this nuclear option is a \nstark reminder that Washington is not caught up fighting for the \nbroader interests of the American people, that we are not spending most \nof our time consumed by the things that affect the lives of average \nAmericans--losing their jobs, seeing more expensive health care, \nwatching jobs go overseas, seeing the deficit grow, seeing the trade \ndeficit grow, wondering about the health care system of our Nation, \nschools where our kids still have teachers who dig into their pockets \nin order to take out of their not-so-great salaries to put materials in \nfront of those kids so they can study--while we here make other \nchoices.\n  From the outside looking in, our democracy appears broken to an awful \nlot of Americans. It certainly seems to be endangered by a one-party \nrule--not a supermajority, a simple majority--in a very closely divided \nNation, a party rule that seems intent on amassing power to be able to \neffect its will no matter what, often at the expense of the real work \nand the real needs of the American people.\n  Now, in recent weeks alone, we have witnessed a really disturbing \ncourse of events, probably as disturbing as I have seen in the 22 years \nI have been privileged to serve here. Republican leaders of Congress, \nin my judgment--I say this respectfully--are crossing lines I think \nshould not be crossed: the line that says a leader of the House of \nRepresentatives should never carelessly threaten or intimidate Federal \njudges; the line that says the leader of the Senate should never accuse \nthose who disagree with his political tactics of waging a war against \npeople of faith; the line that says respect for core constitutional \nprinciples should never be undermined by a political party's agenda; \nmost important of all, the line that\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\nsays that a political party's leader should never let the hunger to get \ndone whatever that political agenda is overshadow the needs and the \ninterests of respecting both the Constitution and the will of the \nAmerican people.\n  It is, frankly, almost hard to believe that in a Congress where \nleaders of both parties once worked together to find common ground \ndespite ideological differences, we face this. If Everett Dirksen were \nhere, or Hugh Scott, people I was privileged to meet as a younger \nAmerican when I was looking at the system, I think they would shudder \nat this relationship we see today.\n  Yesterday, when Jim Jeffords announced his retirement, I remembered \nthe very different words about a different Washington that Jim captured \nso eloquently about 4 years ago. He spoke of a political tradition \nwhere leaders represented their States first. They spoke their minds, \nhe said, often to the dismay of their party leaders. And they did their \nbest to guide this city in the direction of our fundamental principles.\n  It is underscored by what happened in the Foreign Relations Committee \njust the other day. Our distinguished colleague, Senator Voinovich, had \nthe courage to think. He had the courage to tap into his own conscience \nand to respect that tradition of thought and individualism in the \nSenate. But it was astonishing the reaction of the press, the reaction \nof the commentators, the reaction of partisans, the reaction of members \nof his own party, who underscored how rare, how absolutely out of order \nand how out of the sequence it was for this Senator to individualize \nhis judgment, all of a sudden.\n\n  Senator Voinovich is now being vilified on talk radio and on the \nInternet for having the audacity to say that he felt uncomfortable \ncasting a vote without enough information. He did not say he planned to \nvote against the President's nominee; he said he just wants to make an \ninformed decision on the matter, a matter of great importance. That \ndoes not seem very controversial to me. But, oh, boy, are the attack \nfolks out. The daggers are out. Senator Voinovich is persona non grata \namong certain circles.\n  Senator Chafee actually said he had never seen such an act as Senator \nVoinovich's in his 4 years in Washington. What a terrible comment on \nthe way this place works today, that a new Senator has not seen an act \nof individual conscience where a Senator thinks something through and \nrealizes he is not prepared and wants more information. Before the era \nof C-SPAN and 24-hour news and 24-hour attack and the World Wide Web, \nSenators showed the courage and the independence all the time. Senators \ndid not think twice about acting on their conscience ahead of \npartisanship. And today, it is a statement that Senator Voinovich is \nsubject to widespread denigration in partisan circles, when Americans \nought to be standing up and admiring and respecting his independence.\n  Open your eyes across this country and look at what is happening in \nthe Congress today, and you are quickly reminded that some of those who \nrun this city have chosen to do so in a way that does not seek to find \nthat common ground, that does not try to stay in touch with the \nmainstream values but pushes a narrower set of priorities.\n  What does it tell you when an embattled majority leader of the House \nis willing to go on talk radio and attack a Supreme Court Justice, let \nalone a Supreme Court Justice appointed by Ronald Reagan, confirmed by \na nearly unanimous Senate, a Justice who ruled in favor of President \nBush in Bush v. Gore? Ronald Reagan's nominee to the highest court in \nthe land cannot even escape Tom DeLay's partisan assaults. Yet here on \nthe floor of the Senate there is no outcry, no moderating Republican \nvoice willing to say this shocking attack has no place in our \ndemocracy.\n  I guess none of this should be a surprise when the majority leader \nannounces what he is going to do on this Sunday. The majority leader \nplans to headline a religious service devoted to defeating, and I \nquote, ``a filibuster against people of faith.''\n  Mr. President, I resent that. I am a person of faith, and I do not \nbelieve we should lose our right to have a filibuster to stop things \nthat we disagree with, according to the rules of the Senate. It has \nnothing to do with faith. And when the leader of the Senate questions \nhow any Senator applies their faith in opposing procedures of the \nSenate, we are going too far. You go beyond endangering the rules that \nprotect the cherished rights of the majority and the minority; you wind \nup challenging the foundation of our democracy and of how this Senate \nis supposed to work.\n  Make no mistake, this may be an isolated issue, but the rights of the \nminority are fundamental to our democracy. Many people have written \nthat the real sign of a democracy is not the rights of the majority. It \nis the rights of the minority that are, in fact, a signal of a truly \nstrong and vibrant democracy, and diluting those rights is a threat to \nthat vibrancy.\n  Forces outside the mainstream now seem to effortlessly push \nRepublican leaders toward conduct that the American people do not want \nin their elected leaders--inserting the Government into our private \nlives, injecting religion into debates about public policy when it does \nnot apply, jumping through hoops to ingratiate themselves to their \nparty's base--while, step by step and day by day, real problems that \nkeep Americans up at night fall by the wayside here in Washington.\n  We each have to ask ourselves, Who is going to stop it? Who is going \nto stand up and say: Are we really going to allow this to continue? Are \nRepublicans in the House going to continue spending the people's time \ndefending Tom DeLay, or are they going to defend America and defend our \ndemocracy?\n  Will Republican Senators let their silence endorse Senator Frist's \nappeal to religious division, or will they put principle ahead of \npartisanship and refuse to follow him across that line? Will they join \nin an effort across the aisle to heal the wounds of this institution \nand begin addressing the countless challenges that face this Nation? It \nis time to come together to fulfill our fundamental obligations to our \nsoldiers, our military families who have sacrificed so much. It is time \nto bring down gas prices and to move America toward less dependence on \nforeign oil. It is time to find common ground to cover the 11 million \nchildren in this country who have no health insurance at all. Are we \nwilling to allow Washington to become a place where we can rewrite the \nethics rules to protect Tom DeLay but sell out the ethics of the \nAmerican people by refusing to rewrite a law to provide health care to \nevery child in the country? Are we willing to allow the Senate to fall \nin line with the majority leader when he invokes faith, all of our \nfaiths over here? Joe Lieberman is a person of faith. Harry Reid is a \nperson of faith. They don't believe we should rewrite the rules of the \nSenate. And we certainly should not allow this to be an issue of people \nwho believe in the Constitution somehow challenging the faith of others \nin our Nation.\n  Are we going to allow the majority leader to invoke faith to rewrite \nSenate rules to put substandard extremist judges on the bench? Is that \nwhere we are now? It is not up to us to tell any one of our colleagues \nwhat to believe as a matter of faith.\n  I can tell you what I do believe though. When you have tens of \nthousands of innocent souls perished in Darfur, when 11 million \nchildren are without health insurance, when our colossal debt subjects \nour economic future to the whims of Asian bankers, no one can tell me \nthat faith demands all of a sudden that you put the Senate in a \nposition where it is going to pull itself apart over the question of a \nfew judges. No one with those priorities has a right to use faith to \nintimidate any one of us.\n  It is time we made it clear that we are not willing to lie down and \nput this narrow, stubborn agenda ahead of our families, ahead of our \nConstitution, and ahead of our values. The elected leadership in \nWashington owes the American people and this institution better than \nthis.\n  What is at stake is far more than the loss of civility or the \nsacrifice of bipartisanship. What is at stake is our values, both as a \ncountry and an institution, respecting the rights of the minority, \nseparation of church and state, honesty and responsibility.\n  Every one of us knows there is no real crisis in the confirmation of\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\njudges or judicial nominations, when over 90 percent of the President's \nnominees have already been confirmed, 205 out of 215 total. What is \nreally at stake is something a lot greater, a struggle between a great \npolitical tradition in the United States that seeks common ground so we \ncan do the common good, and a new ethic that on any given issue is \nprepared to use any means to justify the end of absolute victory over \nwhatever and whoever stands in the way of that ethic; a new view that \nsays if you don't like the facts, just change them; if you can't win \nplaying by the rules, just rewrite them; a new view that says if you \ncan't win a debate on the strength of your argument, demonize your \nopponents; a new view that says it is OK to ignore the overwhelming \npublic interest as long as you can get away with it. For what? For a \nso-called nuclear option over a few judges, an option that seeks to put \nextreme, substandard judges on the bench against the will of the \nAmerican people.\n  Is it worth undermining our democracy on behalf of Priscilla Owens, \nwho took contributions from Enron and Halliburton and then ruled in \ntheir favor? A conflict? Is it worth this distraction from the people's \nbusiness to confirm a Charles Pickering who fought against implementing \nthe Voting Rights Act and manipulated the judicial system to reduce the \nsentence of a convicted cross burner? Is it worth throwing out 200 \nyears of Senate tradition to defend William Myers, Janice Rogers Brown, \nand Bill Pryor whom numerous members of the impartial American Bar \nAssociation deemed unqualified?\n  The fact that we even have to debate a nuclear option over these \njudges tells you this is all about power, about victory, about a sort \nof unchallenged ability to be able to do whatever you want, despite the \nfact that that is not the way it works here and that is not the way our \nFounding Fathers intended it to work.\n  It is time to put Americans back in control of their own lives and \nput Washington back on their side. That means restoring accountability, \naccountability for false promises, accountability for failure to \naddress issues that we have promised to address, ranging from energy \nindependence to military families who just lose their benefits when \nthey are called to duty and struggle with their families, \naccountability for fiscal insanity, for record deficits, for mounting \ndebts. That is the debate we owe the American people, accountability \nfor 45 million Americans who have no health care and middle-class \nAmericans who are one doctor's bill away from bankruptcy, especially \nthe 11 million children who have no health care at all. That is what \nthe American people want us to debate with passion, not the rules of \nthe Senate but the legitimacy and the substance of those choices. That \nis what we ought to do.\n  Any Senator who has been here for a period of time has watched the \ndecline of the quality of the exchange between both sides of the aisle \nin this institution. That is not what this Senate is renown for. It is \ncalled the greatest deliberative body in the world, a place where \npeople on both sides can find the common ground and get good things \ndone.\n  I think Senator McCain has said publicly: We are not always going to \nbe in the majority.\n  That has been the course of history here. What goes around comes \naround. That is part of the respect that has always guided this \ninstitution. We need to work harder, all of us, to restore what the \nAmerican people want and haven't had for too long. That is a Washington \nthat works for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4078-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4078-S4079]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JOHN NEGROPONTE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about my good \nfriend, John Negroponte. I have known him and Diana and their \nchildren--Marina, Alejandra, John, George, and Sophia--for quite some \ntime. I think the Nation is very lucky to have a man of the caliber of \nJohn Negroponte on deck, so to speak, and willing to take the \nassignment of being the new Director of National Intelligence. He has \nhad considerable experience as an ambassador.\n  I remember full well the first time I met him was in Honduras when he \nwas the Ambassador there. We had a rather severe problem, as people \nwill recall; we called them the Contras. But I got to know him fairly \nwell in the time we were down there. When he returned to Washington, I \nmet his wife and was with him and spent time with him on a family \nbasis. I have spent time with him now in his various positions he has \nhad since that time, at the U.N. and in Iraq.\n  He is a man of great talent and depth. I believe there are many of \nus--and I am one of them--who had severe questions about the direction \nwe were taking in terms of this new Director of National Intelligence \nand how it would relate to existing agencies and to the State \nDepartment and to the Department of Defense and to the National \nSecurity Agency and all others who are involved in intelligence and \nrelate to those in the Congress who have the oversight responsibility \nfor the intelligence function and for the classified areas of the \nactivities of our Nation.\n  John Negroponte is a man who can do this job. He is a man of great \ntalent. But more than that, he has demonstrated the ability to work \nwith people and various entities, not only here in our country but \nthroughout the world. This new Director of National Intelligence could \nwell become the most important Cabinet position we have in the years to \ncome. John Negroponte is the man to fashion that office, to determine \nwhat it needs in order to function properly at the beginning, and to \nset the course for this new intelligence agency.\n  So I am here to urge that the Senate promptly approve this nomination \nand confirm John Negroponte so he can start on this very important \ntask.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of the \nsenior Senator from Alaska concerning the qualifications of John \nNegroponte. Both the Senator from Alaska and I have known him for many \nyears and his service is one of great distinction. I am confident he \nwill receive the endorsement of an overwhelming majority of the Senate.\n\n\n                       Nomination of John Bolton\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of John \nBolton as ambassador to the United Nations. We all know, somewhat \nunexpectedly, Mr. Bolton's nomination has been held pending further \ndiscussion and consideration by the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I want to say I strongly support Mr. Bolton's nomination. He has been \nconfirmed by the Senate four times in the past. He is a smart, \nexperienced, hardworking, and talented man, and he knows the United \nNations. He is not a career diplomat, but neither was Jean Kirkpatrick. \nHe is not a career diplomat, either by profession or temperament, but \nthen the role of ambassador to the U.N. has always required something \nspecial. A look back at some of the personalities who have held the \njob--from Adlai Stevenson to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, from Madeleine \nAlbright, to Jean Kirkpatrick, to Richard Holbrooke--shows that \ndirectness and forcefulness are assets, not hindrances, to \neffectiveness there.\n  We all know Mr. Bolton is perhaps not the world's most beloved \nmanager, nor one to keep his temper entirely under wraps. Perhaps, Mr. \nPresident, that evokes a certain sympathy and empathy from this \nindividual, although it is well known that on no occasion have I ever \nbecome emotionally involved in anything.\n  I am sorry about a little levity here.\n  Seriously, I ask my colleagues is it unique to Mr. Bolton to be \nstrong in his views and opinions? If a temper and an unorthodox \nmanagement style were disqualifiers from Government service, I would \nbet a large number of people in Washington would be out of a job.\n  It is worth wondering not whether Mr. Bolton is a mild, genteel \ndiplomat--we know he is not--but rather whether he is the \nrepresentative we need at the United Nations. We need an ambassador who \ntruly knows the U.N. We need an ambassador who is willing to shake up \nan organization that requires serious reform. No one knows better than \nthe Senator from Minnesota, who is in the chair, who has\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nbeen heavily involved in the issues of the U.N. We need an ambassador \nwho has the trust of the President and the Secretary of State. Mr. \nBolton, it seems to me, has what it takes for the job.\n  I am reminded, on the judges issue and in this issue, elections do \nhave consequences. I believe there are significant numbers of the \nAmerican people who do take into consideration the consequences of a \nPresidential election, and that is the earned right of a President, \nunder anything other than unusual circumstances, to pick his team. \nThere were nominees of the previous Clinton administration I didn't \nagree with, I would not have selected but because President Clinton was \nelected President, I voted for his nominees on that basis.\n  The U.N. is a vital organization to the world and to the national \ninterests of the United States. It is not perfect by any means, and \nJohn Bolton knows this. There has been talk that the nomination of Mr. \nBolton was an indication of the administration's disdain for \nmultilateral diplomacy. I cannot believe Mr. Bolton wishes to be \ndispatched for 4 years to an ineffective body, unloved by the United \nStates. I do believe he wants to work actively to reform the U.N., make \nit stronger and better. Mr. Bolton, seeing clearly the U.N.'s strengths \nand its weaknesses, will be well positioned to improve the organization \nand America's relationship with him.\n\n  As the Chair well knows, what kind of a U.N. is it that has Libya, \nCuba, and Zimbabwe as part of its Human Rights Commission? Is it all \nright with the U.N. today? We are seeing more and more indications of \nthe Oil-for-Food scandal which, again, the Senator from Minnesota, the \nChair, has carefully examined. There is a crying need for reform.\n  I am pleased the Secretary General of the U.N. has made proposals for \nreform. I support those and believe perhaps we need more. Again, it \nseems to me Mr. Bolton sees clearly the strengths and weaknesses, and \nhe would be well positioned to help in this reform effort. Let's not \nforget that it desperately needs improving. It is hard to take an \norganization that has countries such as I mentioned that are members of \nthe Human Rights Commission or whose General Assembly equates Zionism \nwith racism. But at the moment, a great opportunity presents itself. \nThe panel named by the Secretary General, on which one of my most \nrespected Americans and beloved Americans, Brent Scowcroft, served, has \nrecently issued its list of recommendations to transform the U.N. Kofi \nAnnan has presented his own serious plan to implement these \nrecommendations.\n  In other words, I argue that right now the U.N. is in a unique \nmoment, perhaps, in its history; and because of the scandals associated \nwith it, it is open to reform. We need a strong personality, in my \nview, and a knowledgeable one to help bring about those reforms.\n  But without hard work and pressure, nothing will happen. Over the \nyears, the U.N. has proven itself to be remarkably resistant to change. \nI believe John Bolton could provide the medicine the United Nations \nneeds.\n  As I mentioned earlier, elections have consequences, and one \nconsequence of President Bush's reelection is he actually should have \nthe right to select officials of his choice. I stress this because the \nPresident nominates not the Democrats' selection, nor mine, nor that of \nany other Senator, but his own choice. I mentioned that when President \nClinton was elected, I didn't share the policy views of some of the \nofficials he nominated, but I voted to confirm them, knowing the \nPresident has a right to put into place the team he believes will serve \nhim best.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee is examining whether Mr. Bolton has \nengaged in truly unacceptable behavior that would disqualify him for \noffice. I believe, unless we see a pattern of inappropriate conduct--\nwhich so far I have not--I believe the Senate must move forward \nexpeditiously to confirm John Bolton as America's ambassador to the \nUnited Nations.\n  Mr. President, as I criticize some of the activities of the U.N., \nthere are other activities of the U.N. going on as we speak that I \nthink require America's presence. The situation in Darfur, Sudan, for \nexample, is one that cries out for American participation in the \ndecisionmaking process because one could draw a scenario where under \nextreme circumstances, to prevent genocide, American troops, or \ncertainly American support in the form of logistics and other areas, \ncould be heavily involved, as well as expenditure of American tax \ndollars, which already constitutes a significant portion of the \nfinancing of the United Nations.\n  So I hope we can set a time and date certain for a vote on Mr. \nBolton. As I said, if somebody has information that would disqualify \nhim, that is fine. I don't think he or anybody else deserves a long, \ndrawn-out, exhausting process which damages our ability to participate \nin the U.N. and also may damage the character of a good man.\n  I hope we will act as expeditiously as possible. I have great respect \nfor the Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman, Senator Lugar, \nall members, and the ranking member, Senator Biden. But I certainly \nhope they realize inordinate delay is not healthy. I, having had the \nopportunity of knowing Mr. Bolton for many years, believe he would do \nan outstanding job as our ambassador to the United Nations.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4079-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4079-S4083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2005\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume the pending business, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1268) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005, \n     to establish and rapidly implement regulations for State \n     driver's licenses and identification document security \n     standards, to prevent terrorists from abusing the asylum laws \n     of the United States, to unify terrorism-related grounds for \n     inadmissibility and removal, to ensure expeditious \n     construction of the San Diego border fence, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Ensign amendment No. 487, to provide for additional border \n     patrol agents for the remainder of fiscal year 2005.\n       Bayh amendment No. 520, to appropriate an additional \n     $213,000,000 for Other Procurement, Army, for the procurement \n     of Up-Armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles \n     (UAHMMWVs).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 15 minutes equally divided. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 520\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  In December, just a few months ago, the Secretary of Defense on a \nvisit to Iraq was asked by a soldier why our troops were sent into \nbattle with unarmored vehicles.\n  It was a question on the minds of many Americans--especially those \nwith sons, daughters, husbands, wives, friends, and neighbors who had \nanswered their country's call and whose lives are on the line every day \nin Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The American people are appalled that our troops have had to fend for \nthemselves by strapping plywood and scrap metal onto their vehicles. \nOur troops call them ``cardboard coffins.'' As one soldier who served \nin Iraq said, ``I would feel safer in a Volvo than I would in one of \nthese (unarmored) Humvees.''\n  But month after month, the Pentagon has failed to provide enough \narmored Humvees to meet the urgent security needs of our troops on \ndangerous patrols in Iraq. On nine different occasions, we have asked \nthe Pentagon for their requirements for armored Humvees, and nine times \nthey have been wrong.\n  An now the Pentagon actually wants to decrease the production of \narmored Humvees.\n  Tell that to our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and they'll let you \nknow how irresponsible that is--just as they told Secretary Rumsfeld on \nhis trip to Iraq in December.\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\n  Tell that to the family of James Sherill, a Kentucky National \nGuardsman who was killed in an unarmored vehicle just this month.\n  Tell that to the families in Massachusetts who have lost loved ones \nin Iraq.\n  Tell that to the tens of thousands of dedicated men and women in \nuniform about to serve their second and third tours there. Tell them \nthey may have to ride into the danger zone yet again without enough \narmor.\n  We know that American companies can produce more.\n  Armor Holdings--the company that puts the armor on the armored \nHumvee--told my office this morning that its current contract with the \nArmy will mean sharp reductions in production. Right now, they provide \n550 armored Humvees a month. Their current Army contract calls for only \n239 in June, zero in July, 40 in August, and 71 in September. The \ncompany is negotiating with the Army for slightly higher levels of \nproduction for June, July, and August, but it still expects to decrease \nproduction to 71 by September.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take another minute.\n  We cannot let the Department of Defense get it wrong for the tenth \ntime. For the sake of our troops we need to get it right.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Department of Defense to Senator Inouye that says:\n\n       To sustain production at the maximum capacity through the \n     end of FY05, the Army would need an additional funding of \n     approximately $213 million.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of the Army, Office of the Deputy Chief of \n           Staff, G-3/5/7,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Inouye,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Defense, Committee \n         on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inouye: Greatly appreciate your outstanding \n     support as you work your way through the FY05 supplemental \n     request. Understand you are receiving several inquiries \n     regarding Up-Armored HMMWVs (UAH). To lend clarity to Army \n     requirements for the UAH in support of the Global War on \n     Terrorism (GWOT), we provide the following information.\n       The current GWOT requirement for UAH is 10,079. The amount \n     already appropriated and supported in reprogramming actions \n     funds 4,528 UAHs in FY05 enabling the Army to meet the 10,079 \n     requirement in June 05 with no additional funding.\n       We currently are producing at the manufacturer's maximum \n     capacity of 550 per month. This will continue through June \n     05, at which time production rates will decline. To sustain \n     production at the maximum capacity through the end of FY05, \n     the Army would need additional funding of approximately $213 \n     million; however, this sum is not necessary to address the \n     extant requirement.\n       Thank you very much for your hard work and fast action on \n     the supplemental bill. Your dedication to our men and women \n     in uniform, and their families, is deeply valued.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             David F. Melcher,\n\n                                               Lieutenant General,\n                            U.S. Army, Deputy Chief of Staff, G-8.\n\n                                            James J. Lovelace,\n\n                                               Lieutenant General,\n                            U.S. Army, Deputy Chief of Staff, G-3.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The House of Representatives added 232. This amendment \nis to do what the Department of Defense says is necessary to keep the \nproduction line going. I hope it will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 368, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, amendment No. 368, as modified, was \naccepted by both sides on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee last \nnight before a unanimous consent agreement, not in time for inclusion \nin the managers' amendment. I therefore ask unanimous consent to lay \naside the pending amendment so I may call up amendment No. 368, as \nmodified, and ask unanimous consent this amendment be adopted.\n  Senator Brownback, Senator DeWine, and others are on this amendment \nas well, which is funding for the Darfur peacekeeping operations as \nwell as disaster assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is an amendment we worked on for a \nlong time, a Darfur amendment, $50 million for peacekeepers, $40 \nmillion for food aid. It was agreed to but not in the managers' package \nlast night. We do ask unanimous consent this be brought up and we will \nbe asking for a voice vote on it. It has broad bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, this is an amendment that will clearly \nsave lives. It is the right thing to do and I join my colleagues in \nasking it be passed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from \nMississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendment \nbeing called up. We have discussed the amendment with the Senator from \nNew Jersey and the Senators from Kansas and Ohio. We have no objection \nto proceeding to consider the amendment.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. We are not going to join that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] for himself, Mr. \n     DeWine, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Obama, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 368, as modified.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 183, after line 23, add the following:\n\n\n                                 sudan\n\n       Sec.   . Of the funds appropriated in this Act for \n     ``Contributions for International Peacekeeping Activities'', \n     $90,500,000 may be made available for assistance for Darfur, \n     Sudan: Provided, That within these amounts, $50,000,000 may \n     be transferred to ``Peacekeeping Operations'' for support of \n     the efforts of the African Union to halt genocide and other \n     atrocities in Darfur, Sudan; Provided further, That \n     $40,500,000 may be transferred to ``International Disaster \n     and Famine Assistance'' for assistance for Darfur, Sudan and \n     other African countries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 368), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I do not intend to \nobject, but I thought we had a brief time for discussion of this \namendment. That is what I heard the unanimous consent agreement was, \nfor 15 minutes. That is what I thought we were going to debate and vote \non at a quarter of. That is the only reason I raise this objection \nbecause there was a unanimous consent.\n  If the Senator wants to complete a brief unanimous consent request, I \nwill not object, but I hope if there are arguments against this \namendment, we will be able to hear them. We are prepared to put some \nmore arguments out there on the table.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I appreciate the concern of the Senator. I believe the \namendment I am sending to the desk has been agreed to on both sides. \nThere is a second degree. We should be able to move very quickly \nthrough it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 564\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 551) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 564, As Amended\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, prior to a vote on the amendment as \namended, I would like to speak for up to 3 minutes.\n  I have sought recognition to comment on an amendment I have offered \nto address a tremendous gap in coverage that exists in our treatment of \nthe soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen, who are fighting for our \ncountry. My amendment addresses that coverage gap through the creation \nof a new ``Traumatic Injury Protection'' insurance program for the \nbenefit of severely disabled servicemembers. But before I describe my \namendment, let me further discuss the nature of the problem my \namendment would attend to.\n  It is widely known that due to incredible advances in medicine, \nservicemembers who may not have survived life-threatening injuries in \nprevious wars are now making it back home from Iraq and Afghanistan \nalive. That is the good news. The bad news, however, is that they must \nlive with injuries that may have left them without their limbs, sight, \nhearing, speech, or ability to even move.\n  All of my colleagues have likely met with these brave men and women \nin their home States, or right here in Washington, DC, at the Walter \nReed Army Medical Center. They are fighting for their lives. They are \nattempting to learn through physical and occupational therapy how to \nreintegrate back into society. Needless to say, relearning things I and \nmy colleagues take for granted every day--how to walk, how to read, how \nto simply make breakfast in the morning--can take months or, quite \npossibly, years.\n  It is during this rehabilitation period at military hospitals that \nthe need for additional financial resources is most acute. For many \nGuard and Reserve members at Walter Reed, they already have foregone \nhigher paying civilian jobs prior to their deployment. Lengthy recovery \nperiods simply add to the financial strain they bear. In addition, \nfamily members of injured soldiers bear the burdens necessary to travel \nfrom great distances to provide the love and emotional support that is \nabsolutely essential for any successful rehabilitation. Spouses quit \njobs to spend time with their husbands at the hospital. Parents spare \nno expense to be with their injured children.\n  To meet these needs, my amendment would create a ``Traumatic Injury \nProtection'' insurance rider as part of the existing Servicemembers' \nGroup Life Insurance Program. The traumatic insurance would provide \ncoverage for severely disabling conditions at a cost of approximately \n$1 a month for participating servicemembers. The payment for those \nsuffering a severe disability would be immediate and would range from \n$25,000 to a maximum of $100,000. The purpose of the immediate payment \nwould be to give injured servicemembers and their families the \nfinancial cushion they need to sustain them before their medical \ndischarge from service when veterans' benefits would kick in.\n  The traumatic injuries covered under my amendment include: total and \npermanent loss of sight; loss of hands or feet; total and permanent \nloss of speech; total and permanent loss of hearing; quadriplegia; \nparaplegia; burns greater than second degree, covering 30 percent of \nthe body or face; and certain traumatic brain injuries.\n  The cost of the amendment is entirely reasonable given the cause. \nInformal CBO estimates put the FY2006 cost at $10 million. A very small \nprice to pay to meet the needs of these wounded warriors.\n  I cannot take credit for the idea behind this amendment. The credit \nmust go to disabled veterans of the Wounded Warrior Project, run under \nthe aegis of the United Spinal Association. Three Wounded Warrior \nveterans of the Iraq war visited my office last week to discuss the \nneed to provide this type of an insurance benefit. One veteran, former \nArmy SSG Heath Calhoun, had both of his legs amputated after being \nstruck during a rocket propelled grenade attack in Iraq. Heath and his \nwife, Tiffany, who was present with him in my office, described the \nfinancial problems they endured after Tiffany quit her job to be with \nHeath during his convalescence. It took over a year before Heath was \nmedically discharged from service. While the Calhoun family was able to \nmake it through that extremely trying period, Heath told me he was \nadamant that other servicemembers in Iraq should not have to worry \nabout finances should they, too, be injured. The quickest way to \naccomplish that, he told me, was to add a disability insurance rider--\nfinanced by servicemembers through monthly premium deductions--to the \nexisting life insurance program. I am honored to sponsor this amendment \nin the Senate on his, and the other veterans of the Wounded Warrior \nProject's, behalf. I would also like to personally complement Ryan \nKelly, who also visited me last week. Mr. Kelly lost his right leg \nduring an ambush near Baghdad almost 21 months ago. I am told he was a \nprincipal author of the draft legislation that culminated in the \namendment I offer today. I thank him for his fine work.\n  I also want to thank President Bush and his top administration \nofficials for lending their support to this amendment. Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Jim Nicholson, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul \nWolfowitz, and their staffs, who provided invaluable technical support \nin the drafting of this amendment.\n  And most importantly, I want to thank my partner in this effort, the \nCommittee's ranking member, Senator Daniel K. Akaka. I thank him for \ncosponsoring the amendment, and I thank him for joining me in a spirit \nof bipartisanship as we seek to serve veterans together.\n  The supplemental already would make substantial improvements to \nbenefits provided to survivors of those killed in the line of duty. I \napplaud those efforts. But I also remind my colleagues that we must be \nvigilant in our care for those who are still fighting to regain the \nnormalcy of the lives they enjoyed prior to sustaining catastrophic \ninjuries in defense of our freedom. I ask for your support.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I speak in favor of the amendment offered \nby the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Veterans \nAffairs Committee.\n  A few weeks ago, I met with Sergeants Ryan Kelly, Jeremy Feldbusch, \nand Heath Calhoun, all of whom had recently returned from Iraq. They \nserved their country bravely in battle, and in doing so, each of these \nmen sustained a disabling injury that will change their lives forever.\n  When they came home, it would have been easy for them to go about \ntheir own business or feel sorry for themselves.\n  But they did not. Instead, they decided that their service to our \ncountry would not end on the battlefields of Iraq. They would speak out \nfor their fellow soldiers--the ones who also may come home without a \nleg, or an arm, or their sight, but may not have the resources to carry \non and support their families.\n  This amendment is their tribute to their brothers and sisters-in-\narms.\n  For only about $3 per month, it allows service members to purchase \ngroup disability insurance that would award them a maximum of $100,000 \nif they are deemed seriously injured. For disabled veterans who may not \nbe able to work when they come home, this insurance could help them \nobtain long-term care, send their kids to school, or simply make sure \nthat they can pay the bills and still put food on the table. It won't \ncost the Government a dime. It simply needs our approval to allow it to \nhappen.\n  The blessings of modern technology have saved the lives of many \nservice members who would otherwise have died from their wounds. Yet, \nit also means there will be more wounded who need care. Every single \none of us has a fundamental moral duty to take care of those men and \nwomen who've sacrificed to safeguard our freedom. This amendment offers \nus one way to do that, and I thank Senators Craig and Akaka for their \ncooperation in moving this issue forward.\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this important and \ntimely amendment.\n  This amendment will go far to ease the financial burden that is \nplaced on a service member and his or her loved ones as a result of \ntraumatic injury. Between $25,000 and $100,000 will be paid to service \nmembers who suffer such injuries based on severity of injury.\n  Service members and their families face heavy financial burdens while \nhospitalized, and prior to being medically discharged from the \nmilitary. This effort will help lessen the burden that exists on \nservice members and their families before VA benefits kick in.\n  Importantly, to qualify for this necessary benefit, our soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines do not have to do any additional \npaperwork. They are automatically enrolled in this program by virtue of \nbeing a participant in the Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance \nProgram.\n  The insurance premium will cost the service member approximately $1 a \nmonth and will be determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n  This insurance policy is meant to supplement, and not take the place \nof, existing DoD and VA benefits. This amendment is intended to fill a \ngap: assistance to service members and their families during recovery \nfrom a traumatic injury. In no way should anyone view this as a \nprecedence for shifting costs to a service member.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 564), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nconsideration, most importantly the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee for his cooperation, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee for his understanding and work with his staff. As chairman of \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, this was truly a team effort. Working \nwith my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, we have accomplished \nsomething for America's veterans, especially those very traumatically \ninjured, that I think is critical and necessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will speak briefly. If this time is taken \nfrom the time scheduled for a vote at 3:45, I ask unanimous consent \nwhatever time I use extend the vote that amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4083-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4083-S4084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE COURAGE OF SENATOR INOUYE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we all have the good fortune of serving in \nthis body with some outstanding men and women, but I don't think it is \nan exaggeration to say Dan Inouye is a step above us all. He is a man \nfor whom I have the greatest admiration, for many different reasons.\n  Sixty years ago today, on April 21, 1945, Dan Inouye paid an \nincredible price protecting the freedom of our country and the people \nof the world. Senator Daniel K. Inouye showed during World War II what \nkind of a man he is.\n  He was born to Japanese immigrant parents in Honolulu. He witnessed \nthe bombing of Pearl Harbor when he was 17 years old. But he did not \nstand by. He rushed in, provided aid to American troops. This was the \nbeginning of his service to our country.\n  I will read now from his Medal of Honor citation which was received \nfor actions this day 60 years ago, when Senator Inouye and his men were \nin Italy, trying to capture a key mountain ridge.\n  The citation reads:\n\n       With complete disregard for his personal safety, Second \n     Lieutenant Inouye crawled up the treacherous slope to within \n     five yards of the nearest machine gun and hurled two \n     grenades, destroying the emplacement. Before the enemy could \n     retaliate, he stood up and neutralized a second machine gun \n     nest. Although wounded by a sniper's bullet, he continued to \n     engage other hostile positions at close range until an \n     exploding grenade shattered his right arm. Despite the \n     intense pain, he refused evacuation and continued to direct \n     his platoon until enemy resistance was broken and his men \n     were again deployed in defensive positions.\n\n  Senator Inouye lost his arm and received other grievous wounds that \nday defending our freedom. It tells us something about this man, his \ncourage and his heroism.\n  We serve with him every day. He is quiet, unassuming, but he is a \nreal hero. He refused to let anything hold him back, in spite of his \nserious injuries, spending years in the hospital. Following that war, \nhe went to the University of Hawaii, George Washington School of Law. \nHe was elected to the House of Representatives, and now is the third \nmost senior Member of the Senate. Throughout his life and his service, \nDan Inouye has proven himself a man of courage.\n  I am, with all Members in this Senate, Democrats and Republicans, \nproud to call him a friend and a colleague. He gave so much to our \ncountry so long ago but to this day he keeps on giving. We could all \nlearn a lesson from this great American.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to commend the distinguished Senator for those \nremarks. I humbly ask the privilege of being associated with the \nremarks he made.\n  Senator Inouye has been one of the most extraordinary leaders I have \nhad the privilege to serve with in my career in the Senate. I thank him \nand I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't know how the time is allocated, but I will take \n2 or 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes 39 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 520\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, from April of this year, 2005, the GAO \nreport. There are two primary causes for the shortages of up-armored \nvehicles and add-on armor kits: First, a decision was made to pace \nproduction rather than use the maximum available capacity; two, funding \nallocations did not keep up with rapidly increasing requirements.\n  Army officials have not identified any long-term effort to improve \nthe availability of up-armored Humvees or add-on armor kits.\n  The Department of the Army itself says now we are currently producing \nthe 550, they will continue through June 2005, at which the production \nrates decline. To sustain production at the maximum capacity, the Army \nwould need funding at 213. That is exactly what ours does.\n  If we did not include that, we see the dramatic production in the \ncapacity and in the development of that.\n  Why are we doing that? Nine times the Army appeared before the Armed \nServices Committee; nine times they underestimated the needs.\n  A third of the 35 of the young men from my State of Massachusetts \nhave lost their lives because of the lack of up-armor.\n  All we are asking, take it to the conference, 230. The House of \nRepresentatives saw that. Why doesn't the Senate of the United States? \nI hope we would have support for that amendment and let them work it \nout in the conference. Let's make sure we are going to do what needs to \nbe done. We have seen the mistakes of the past. Let's not make another \none today.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How much time remains under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes. That is all the time that is available.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I reserve the remainder of my time and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 487) was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, in the decade before 9/11, al Qaeda \nstudied how to exploit gaps and weaknesses in the borders of the United \nStates.\n  A few months ago, intelligence officials confirmed that the terrorist \nZarqawi plans to infiltrate America through our borders. He plans to \nattack targets such as movie theaters, restaurants, and schools.\n  A year-long investigation recently concluded with authorities \narresting 18 people who planned to smuggle grenade launchers, shoulder-\nfired missiles, and other Russian military weapons into our country.\n  Let's face it--the dual threat of illegal border crossing by people \nwho wish to kill us and the weapons they need to do it is very real.\n  We are not dealing with rational people. We are not dealing with \npeople who respect life or freedom. It would be irresponsible to sit \nidly by and not treat these threats seriously. We must continue to be \ndiligent in our fight to defeat terror and protect our homeland.\n  Before 9/11, INS had only 9,800 border patrol agents. With the agency \nfocused on immigration and narcotics, no major counterterrorism effort \nwas underway.\n  More than 3 years after the devastating terrorist attacks, the men \nand women who serve on the border's frontline of defense are still \noverwhelmed. The Commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection \nhas admitted they need more agents.\n  Our agents catch only about one-third of the estimated 3 million \npeople who cross the border illegally each year. Three and half years \nago it only took 19 to change the course of this country.\n  The 9/11 Commission addressed this very problem. They recommended \nbanning terrorists from traveling to our country. This is exactly what \nmy amendment attempts to accomplish.\n  We must commit resources to block terrorists who attempt to enter our \ncountry. Last year, I sponsored an amendment to the National \nIntelligence Reform Act that authorized the hiring of 10,000 new agents \nto patrol our borders over the next 5 years. And last month, the Senate \napproved a Budget which funded the hiring and training of 2,000 new \nborder patrol agents next year.\n  Border security requires a serious commitment by Congress. There is \nno question that we need to hire new agents. Our security depends on \nit. But it will take more than simply hiring agents. Congress needs to \nincrease funding for training and equipment. I hope we will remember \nthis during the regular appropriations process.\n  We cannot wait another year to improve our border security. This is \nan emergency. The amendment that I am offering will put new agents on \nthe ground in the next few months.\n  My amendment begins to fulfill the commitment Congress made last \nyear. It provides $147 million to hire and train 400 new border patrol \nagents by October; 400 new agents is the maximum number of new agents \nthat the Department of Homeland Security can train before the end of \nthis fiscal year.\n  My amendment does not require any new spending. It is completely \noffset.\n  The 9/11 Commission found that many of the 19 hijackers could have \nbeen placed on watch lists. They were vulnerable to detection by border \nauthorities. Without adequate staff and coordinated efforts, the \nterrorists were allowed to enter the United States. Once here they \nlearned how to fly airplanes at American flight schools. They conducted \nsurveillance to assess our weaknesses. And they attacked.\n  In order to prevent another terrorist attack on American soil, we \nmust improve every aspect of our nation's security. Our security is \ntruly only as strong as our weakest link.\n  For too long, the lack of funding for border agents has been a weak \nlink. By funding additional agents, we protect both our southern and \nour, often neglected, northern border. This will make it harder for \nterrorists to enter the United States and attack us.\n  The world has changed dramatically since 9/11 when the terrorists \nused our open and trusting society against us. We can not allow a \nrepeat of that tragedy. This amendment will help those who guard our \nfrontiers by providing necessary tools to ensure the safety of our \ncitizens.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 520\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on Bayh amendment No. 520.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to speak to the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and I know he was \nanxious to address the Senate with regard to his desire to obtain time \nto speak in opposition to the Bayh amendment. Might I ask, what is the \nparliamentary situation with regard to that? Hopefully, we can see the \nappearance of the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Under the previous order, there \nare 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote on the Bayh amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Chair kindly repeat that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided prior to \nthe vote on the Bayh amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the senior Senator from \nAlaska,\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\nI ask that an additional 10 minutes be allocated to the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, do I understand currently there are 2 \nminutes to be equally divided, and now the Senator from Virginia has \nasked for 10 minutes for one side on this debate? I have no objection, \nobviously, to whatever time the Senator from Alaska wants. I object \nunless those of us who have a differing view have an opportunity to \nexpress ourselves.\n  Mr. WARNER. I misunderstood. I thought the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts and his colleague from Indiana had adequate opportunity \nto speak. I am perfectly willing to ask for 15 minutes equally divided \nbetween the senior Senator from Massachusetts and the senior Senator \nfrom Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with \nthe time to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I oppose the Bayh-Kennedy amendment on \nthe uparmored humvees. The validated global war on terror requirement \nfor this is 10,079. I do hope the Senate will listen. This is very \nserious.\n  We received a letter last week from two senior Army general officers, \nthe Army's G-8 Deputy Chief of Staff for Programs and the Army's G-3 \nDeputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, which states the total \nrequirement for these vehicles is 10,079 and that industry will meet \nthat requirement in less than 2 months with funds previously provided.\n  Keep in mind the pre-emergency throughput of these vehicles was 40 a \nmonth. We are now producing at the rate of 550 a month, and we will \nreach the maximum in June because we paid more to speed up this \nproduction.\n  We appropriated funds and reprogrammed to meet the total requirement. \nWe have now met it. As a matter of fact, we produced 266 more vehicles \nthan the Army wanted. This amendment is not about taking care of \ntroops. I spent my career, and the Senator from Hawaii with me, to \nensure the service men and women have the equipment they need, the \nsupport they need. This is about the production unit of a defense \ncontractor, not about the people who are wearing the uniform in Iraq.\n  This manufacturer is currently producing these at the capacity, as I \nsaid, of 550 a month. Every month, 550 new humvees are going into Iraq. \nWe will have more there by June than we need. There is no need for \nthis. The sponsors want you to believe the Army wants and needs these, \nbut that is not true. The Army's requirement will be met in June, and \nwe have provided some money for all of them. In Iraq, we are meeting \nthe requirements of the commanders in the field, and they have \ncertified to that.\n\n  The additional funding of this amendment was not requested by the \nDepartment, and the commanders are receiving other vehicles now, for \ninstance, the Striker, which is a different system and is providing \nmore protection for the people in the field. They are going in there \nnow.\n  Some people argue the need for these is going up. That is not true. \nThe need for Strikers is going up, and we are sending Strikers in from \nGermany, from Hawaii, from Alaska, from Seattle. We are meeting the \nneeds they demanded, and that is for the Strikers. This requirement is \nnot increasing with the continued operations in Iraq.\n  A major difference now is, after February of this year, all vehicles \noperating outside the protective compound are armored, and we have met \nthat need.\n  This is an emergency appropriations bill. I believe we should focus \non the needs of validated requirements of the Department for the total \nglobal war, but this is not one of them.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment. I yield to my \nfriend, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, so he might be \nheard on the matter. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, I commend Senators Kennedy and \nBayh. They have really fought the battle through the years, and it has \nbeen since fiscal year 2003 we have been dealing with the need for the \nuparmor.\n  As my colleague from Alaska said, and I add this, from fiscal year \n2003 to 2005, the Congress added--that is additional funds--added $1.2 \nbillion to the President's request to increase uparmored humvee \nproduction, and almost $1.9 billion was added to the President's budget \nrequest to increase the production of ballistic add-on armor for \ntactical-wheeled vehicles in the Army and the Marine Corps.\n  I think we have clearly met the demand, and it is largely owing to \nthese two Senators who have been out on the point on this issue. But \nright now these additional funds, I say to my colleague from Alaska, if \nthe Senate were to approve the amendment, would have to be taken out of \nother modernization programs for the Army; am I not correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that is correct. This money comes out of \nthis supplemental for these purposes which is beyond the needs on this \nvehicle and reduce the amount of money for other items that are needed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back the remainder of our time. I thank the \nChair for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, point No. 1, this is additional money. \nPoint No. 2, the House of Representatives added $233 million. Why? For \nthe very reason that was in this letter from the Department of the Army \nthat says ``to sustain production at the maximum capacity through the \nend of fiscal year 2005, the Army would need the additional funding of \napproximately $213 million.'' That is what the Department of Defense \nsays it needs. That is what the House has done.\n  With all respect to the estimates that have been made, under the \ncurrent request, the Department of Defense has testified nine times at \nthe Armed Services Committee in terms of the needs of uparmored \nhumvees. Every time they have been wrong. That is not just me talking. \nThat is the GAO. This April, a GAO report says there are two primary \ncauses for the shortages--shortages, that is the GAO, shortages--of the \nuparmored vehicles and add-on kits. One, a decision was made to pace \nproduction rather than use the maximum available capacity and, \nsecondly, funding allocations did not keep up rapidly with increasing \nrequirements.\n  That is the GAO in April of this year. ``Army officials have not \nidentified any long-term efforts to improve the availability of \nuparmored humvees.'' That is the GAO.\n  The House took it. The GAO says it is necessary. The Department of \nDefense says so, too. Let us just include that and not leave the men \nand women who need the uparmored Humvees at risk in dangerous places \naround the world.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time is remaining? I believe I have used my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 10 seconds.\n  I ask the Senator, is this the first time the Senator from \nMassachusetts has been for something that the Republican House of \nRepresentatives is for?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is a good question. I think I can think back and \nmaybe find one. I will think back and find one. Saint Patrick's Day \naddress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, with reference to the House, I say to our \ncolleague from New Mexico with reference to the House, even a broken \nclock is right twice a day. So there is a first time for everything.\n  It is rare that this body votes on a matter that will affect the life \nand limbs of soldiers fighting as we speak in a theater of war. Now is \nsuch a time. As my colleague, Senator Kennedy, mentioned, the Army has \nchronically underestimated the need for uparmored vehicles in the Iraqi \ntheater. Nine consecutive times they have gotten it wrong. We now have \na letter saying that finally they have gotten it right.\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\n  Walter Reed Army Hospital and the other military hospitals of this \nNation are filled with the young men and women who have paid the price \nfor these errors. When will we err on the side of doing more rather \nthan less to protect the troops? Now is that time.\n  I conclude by saying this: Do my colleagues remember the young \nsoldier who stood up when the Secretary of Defense visited Iraq and \nspoke about hillbilly armor? Do my colleagues remember him speaking \nabout rummaging through the garbage to find metal to weld onto the side \nof the vehicles? Do my colleagues remember the round of applause he got \nfrom his fellow soldiers?\n  The troops know what is going on. The press knows what is going on. \nApparently the House of Representatives knows what is going on. It is \ntime that the Senate took a stand as well to do something about this, \nto give the troops the protection they need. Rummaging through the \ngarbage--that is an outrage. Here is our chance to bring it to a stop. \nI ask my colleagues for their support.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is all time yielded back?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the balance of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I see that the distinguished ranking member of the State \nand Foreign Operations Subcommittee, Senator Leahy is here on the \nSenate floor. I am wondering it he would take just a moment to discuss \nwith me the critical issue of the avian flu.\n  Mr. President, an outbreak of the avian flu would be an international \ncalamity. In this age when you can get on a plane in Bangkok and arrive \nin Chicago or Burlington in hours, we must face the reality that this \nthreat is not a problem isolated half a world away, but is one that \ncould affect people in Illinois, Vermont, and all across America. The \ndirector of the Centers for Disease Control recognized the grave \nconsequences this virus could pose to international health when she \nrecently stated that ``this is a very ominous situation for the globe . \n. . [this is] the most important threat we are facing right now.'' It \nis something that is clearly an emergency and is appropriately \naddressed in the Iraq Supplemental.\n  At this point, humans contract the virus overwhelmingly by coming \ninto contact with infected animals, and once contracted, the virus is \nextremely deadly--a 65 to 75 percent mortality rate for humans--\nespecially because there is no proven vaccine for the H5N1 strain. \nFurther, effective treatments for this strain of the virus are not \nwidely available and must be delivered within 24 hours.\n  The recent trends with respect to the spread of the avian flu are \nvery alarming. Over the last few months, there is growing evidence \nwhich suggests that the virus may be mutating and could eventually \nresult in a form that is transmittable from human to human. If this \nwere to occur, it could cause the deaths of millions of people, \nseriously damage economic activity in Southeast Asia, and cause panic \nand instability throughout the region. Moreover, because of the dynamic \nnature of Southeast Asia, with all sorts of commerce and transport in \nand out of the region, the virus would likely spread around the world--\nincluding to the United States, in a matter of hours or days.\n  I would ask my good friend, the senior Senator from Vermont, who has \na\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nlong history of leadership on international health issues. for his \nassessment of what needs to be done.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I would say to the Senator from Illinois that, earlier \nthis year, the World Health Organization convened a conference on this \nissue. The WHO concluded that the international community does not \npossess sufficient plans and resources to effectively respond to an \noutbreak of the avian flu and that additional resources and attention \nto this issue are urgently needed. The WHO called for $100 million in \nnew resources from the international community to prevent, and if \nnecessary, respond to an outbreak of the avian flu.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Just for the record, the $100 million figure is important \nfor our purposes here today. Before the Appropriations Committee put \ntogether the supplemental, we discussed the importance of immediately \naddressing the avian flu before the situation spirals out of control, \nand that $25 million is an appropriate amount to deal with this \ncritical emergency. I am correct?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, the Senator is correct. When the Appropriations \nCommittee was putting together the Supplemental, the Majority and \nMinority, working together, included $25 million to prevent and respond \nto an outbreak of the avian flu, because of the urgent nature of the \nsituation in southeast Asia.\n  I would also add that $25 million is one-fourth of the WHO appeal, \nand as we know, the traditional U.S. share of such multilateral efforts \nis one-fourth of the total cost. I would also point out that this is \nthe amount that has been authorized in S. 600, the Foreign Assistance \nAuthorization bill that was debated in the Senate last week.\n  Mr. OBAMA. I also know that USAID has already formulated a rapid \nresponse plan to use this $25 million, if it is ultimately \nappropriated.\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is correct. The administration urgently needs this \nmoney and it will be well spent if appropriated. In fact, the money \nwill be used to address the avian flu and build lasting mechanisms and \nnetworks to address other viruses that will undoubtedly arise in \nsoutheast Asia. The $25 million to combat the avian flu is important \nfor Southeast Asia and the United States.\n\n\n            ENSURING THE MILITARY DEATH BENEFIT IS TAX FREE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on my amendment No. 497 \nto ensure that increased military death benefits are tax free.\n  We know that more than 1,700 servicemen and women have made the \nultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. We don't always focus on \nthe families that have to live their lives without a husband or wife, \nwithout a son or daughter, without a father or mother, without a \nbrother or sister.\n  Already in March, Newsweek estimated that 1,043 American children had \nlost a parent in Iraq. The stories of these children trying to cope \nwith the reality that a parent isn't coming home will break your heart. \nBut the families of those who die for their country also have to \nstruggle with more mundane challenges, like the loss of the main \nbreadwinner.\n  Staff Sargeant Kendell Waters-Bey was a 29-year-old Marine from \nBaltimore. He was one of the first American servicemembers to die in \nIraq, among 12 people killed in a helicopter crash.\n  Michael and Angela Waters-Bey lost their only son; that's hard \nenough. But 10-year-old Kenneth lost his father. My Maryland colleague \nin the House, Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger, helped to set up a trust \nfund to pay for Kenneth's college education.\n  Another Marylander, Naval Reserve Lieutenant Kylan Jones-Huffman, was \nkilled by small arms fire in Iraq. Lieutenant Jones-Huffman was a \ngraduate of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, and he returned there \nto teach history before being deployed to Iraq.\n  These are just two of the many families in Maryland and across the \nNation that experience the sacrifices of this war every day. They \ndeserve our gratitude--not just words, but deeds.\n  I'm proud to be a member of the Appropriations Committee. We did what \nis right to support our troops by reporting out a strong emergency \nsupplemental bill to meet the needs of our men and women in uniform in \nIraq and Afghanistan and around the world. We did what is right by \nincreasing the military death benefit immediately paid to the family of \na member of our military who is killed.\n  This bill will raise the military death benefit from just over \n$12,000 to $100,000.\n  The supplemental bill also provides a benefit to make the increase \nretroactive to October 7, 2001, the start of the war in Afghanistan \nafter the September 11 attacks.\n  The Senate has also rightly adopted the Kerry amendment to ensure \nthat the death benefit increase covers all soldiers, sailors, airmen \nand marines who die on active duty.\n  I also appreciate the Senate's adoption of the Salazar amendment, to \nme the so-called death gratuity as fallen heroes compensation. While we \nunderstand that no compensation can make up for the loss of a family \nmember, the new name adopted by the Senate recognizes that we are \nhelping the families of our fallen heroes.\n  I believe just about every Senator shares my view that the military \ndeath benefit should not be taxed.\n  We need to make sure that the full amount is paid to the family of a \nservice member who dies for our country. We are a grateful Nation, and \nthis is one of the ways we express our gratitude.\n  Under our tax law, the death benefit is excluded from gross income. \nThat means families don't have to pay income tax on it. We don't want \nthe family of a hero who died for our country to be handed the American \nflag from the casket in one hand, and get a bill from the IRS in the \nother.\n  My amendment will make sure that the payments to make the death \nbenefit increase retroactive are not taxed.\n  I appreciate the support of the National Military Family Association \nfor my amendment.\n  I also appreciate the support of the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nCorzine, who is a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  I hope that the Senate will send a strong message that we intend the \nmilitary death benefit to be tax-free.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I want to thank my friend, Senator Mikulski, for her \nwork on this issue. You have called attention to a solemn and \ncritically important issue, and I commend you and join with you in your \ncommitment to ensure that we provide a real and meaningful death \ngratuity to the families of our brave young men and women who have paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice. And I also share your commitment to ensure that \nthose who have paid the ultimate sacrifice are not forced to pay \nagain--to the IRS, in the form of taxation of these gratuity payments.\n  Unfortunately, addressing the tax treatment of these payments on this \nbill could raise procedural hurdles to getting this bill signed into \nlaw as quickly as possible. But as Chairman of the Finance Committee, I \npledge to work with you, Senator Baucus in his role as ranking member, \nand the rest of the Finance Committee and Congress to ensure that these \ngratuity payments will not be subject to Federal tax and to enact any \nnecessary changes at the earliest possible date on the first available \nvehicle. I look forward to working with the gentlelady to resolve this \nissue expeditiously.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the efforts of my friend \nand colleague Senator Mikulski to protect payments to the families of \nour brave Americans serving and dying for this country. There are \ncurrently 1,254 Montanans deployed overseas in Iraq and Afghanistan \nwith one-third of those deployed coming from our guard and reserve \nforces. We have lost seven service members since the war on terrorism \nbegan and with each sacrifice I am made more aware of the strength and \ncommitment of our military families.\n\n  Senator Mikulski has wisely offered an amendment to ensure that the \nadditional death gratuity benefits would not be subject to taxes, just \nas other death gratuity benefits for military families are tax-free. It \nis certainly my hope that such an amendment is not needed. However, I \nhave promised to work with Senator Mikulski and my good friend, \nChairman Grassley, to clarify that this is the case, should there be \nany question in the future about the tax-free status of these payments. \nCertainly, for these families who have already given so much to this \ncountry, it is the right thing to do.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nthe Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, and the ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, for their support of ensuring that death benefits paid \nto the families of those who give their lives for our country are tax-\nfree. I appreciate their commitment to getting this done through \nappropriate tax legislation, if necessary, as soon as possible. And I \nappreciate the help of their staff on the Finance Committee, who worked \nwith my staff on this issue.\n  Given these commitments from Chairman Grassley and Senator Baucus, I \nwill not proceed with my amendment on this critical supplemental \nappropriations bill to meet the needs of our troops.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Supplemental Appropriations bill \nincludes a provision, Section 6023, which allows the Department of \nEnergy to count subcontracts towards their small business prime \ncontracting goal and caps the total agency small business goal at 23 \npercent.\n  Section 6023 amends the Small Business Act, which falls under the \njurisdiction of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship but neither Senator Snowe, the chairwoman of the \ncommittee, nor I, the ranking member, were consulted about this \nlanguage prior to its introduction.\n  The Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship has a \nlongstanding position opposing the counting of subcontracts towards \nsmall business prime contracting goals at the Department of Energy. And \nfor good reason, doing it this way is faking. It's saying that you are \nawarding prime Federal contracts to small business when you really \naren't.\n  This language will essentially cut small businesses out of contracts \nat the Department of Energy across the Nation by removing all \nincentives for the agency to create prime contracting opportunities for \nthese firms. This provision would reduce the amount of contracts \navailable for small firms, shrinking their revenue stream, reducing \njobs and hurting the economy. Also, by reducing competition in the \nmarketplace this language would prevent the Federal Government from \nbenefiting from the billions of dollars in savings that come from that \ncompetition.\n  Even more problematic is the precedent this would set for government \ncontracts. It would open the door for any agency with management and \noperations contractors, facilities managers, or systems integrators to \nseek an exemption from Federal acquisition law with regard to prime \ncontract awards to small firms.\n  Mr. President, I recognize the concern that Senator Domenici has for \nhis firms in New Mexico and for the two DOE laboratories located in his \nState. The loss of contracts by local businesses is a concern that \nSenator Snowe and I would be happy to address with Senators Domenici \nand Bingaman. However, this language does nothing to guarantee that \ncontracts stay local; instead it simply shifts the authority to award \nGovernment prime contracts away from a Federal agency and gives that \nauthority to private, for-profit corporate entities. The availability \nof prime and subcontracting opportunities for small firms at the DOE is \na complicated issue that needs a thorough investigation and analysis \nbefore adopting legislation that could irreparably harm small \nbusinesses throughout the Nation. An emergency supplemental bill is not \nthe place for this language.\n  Finally, I have received a draft copy of the GAO report requested by \nSenators Domenici, Bingaman, Snowe and myself on this very subject--DOE \nsmall business contracting. The draft report has a number of disturbing \nfindings including: the complete lack of oversight in M \nsubcontracting by the Department of Energy, falsified reporting data, \nand the mismanagement of subcontracts by large prime contractors. Given \nthe serious nature of the problems with these M contractors, it is \nhighly inappropriate for the Congress to now exempt the Agency from its \noversight duties and hand over all control to these companies.\n  I have worked diligently with Senators Snowe, Bingaman, and Domenici \nto find compromise language that would address Senator Domenici's \nconcerns without causing irreparable damage to the small business \ncommunity. Unfortunately, we ran out of time before this bill was \nadopted. However, I hope that we can continue to work on finding a real \nsolution and correct this harmful provision in the conference to ensure \nthat small businesses receive their fair share of DOE contracts. I \nbelieve we can do that without adversely affecting the agency's ability \nto successfully permit its core duties.\n  Mr. President, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill before \nthe Senate is a vitally important piece of legislation. It provides $81 \nbillion in immediate funds for U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand to meet critical needs for other important national priorities, \nincluding tsunami relief.\n  The war in Iraq has been a divisive issue in our country. People have \npassionate views on the subject--a passion that is matched by our \nconcern for the welfare of the men and women of the American military. \nIt is that concern and a real desire for them to succeed that has \ndriven us all to push the administration toward adopting a better \napproach to the mission in Iraq.\n  In recent months, President Bush has made progress in drawing \nadditional international support to the training of Iraqi security \nforces. We can wonder what took so long and hope that their efforts in \nrecent months were just the beginning, but we all recognize that the \nIraqi election was an important milestone and success--a success made \npossible by the courage of the Iraqi people and the dedication of the \nmen and women of the American military.\n  But the mission there is not complete. Even this week Iraq has been \nstruck by deadly violence against innocent civilians. And the nascent \ngovernment, even after the first election, can only be described as \nfragile. The Iraqi people are in the midst of an experiment with \ndemocracy--an experiment that must succeed. This supplemental bill will \ngive them the tools and resources they need to succeed.\n  The legislation also provides critical funds for the mission in \nAfghanistan. The war against al-Qaida and international terrorism is \nnot yet won, and our forces need these funds to continue the fight, to \nsupport the emergence of a free Afghanistan, and to bring Osama bin \nLaden to justice.\n  Last week, the Senate adopted two amendments I offered to improve \nbenefits for surviving military families. One amendment extends the \nlength of time surviving families may stay in military housing free of \ncharge to one year. Military families suffer in unique ways when a \nloved one is lost in the line of duty. In the midst of grieving they \nmust almost immediately plan to move and change their entire life. For \nthose with children in school, the loss is compounded by the disruption \nin school and friends that moving in the midst of the school year may \nbring. The amendment the Senate accepted last week gives surviving \nmilitary families the opportunity to get their affairs in order, to \nfinish the school year, and to better cope with the loss of a loved one \nbefore having to move. I thank my colleagues for their support in this \neffort.\n  The second amendment I offered increases to $100,000 the death \ngratuity paid to survivors of service members who die on active duty. \nThe current law provides a miserly sum of $12,400. I began talking \nabout the need to increase the death gratuity more than a year ago. \nWhen the administration announced its proposal earlier this year, it \nsought to limit the increase to those who died in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nNo one thought that was a good idea, including the uniformed leadership \nof the United States military. The Senate Appropriations Committee \naddressed part of the problem in its mark of this bill, but avoided the \nsimple solution of changing U.S. Code to read ``$100,000'' instead of \nthe current $12,000. My amendment did just that. And I thank my \ncolleagues for their overwhelming support of it.\n  Our missions in Iraq and Afghanistan are not yet done. Until they \nare, the administration must continue to build international support \nfor our efforts and ensure that the men and women of the American \nmilitary have everything they need to succeed and that their families \nhave the support they need and deserve.\n  The Congress has an important responsibility to pass this legislation \nswiftly. Any effort to unnecessarily burden this legislation with \nimmigration provisions in conference will unnecessarily delay the \npassage of this\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\nvital legislation to the detriment of the men and women in the field \ntoday. I strongly urge the conferees to reject any effort to attach the \nREAL ID Act to this legislation. Let's pass a clean bill that provides \nour forces with the tools they need and the resources they need to \nsucceed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support our troops and their families. \nI am behind them 100 percent. They deserve our gratitude, not just with \nwords but with deeds. We must do right by our troops and their \nfamilies. This strong emergency supplemental appropriations bill helps \nus do just that.\n  In this bill we have provided $5.4 billion to fix or replace \nequipment that has been damaged during combat operations. We have also \nadded $3.3 billion to add armor to all convoy trucks, buy more armored \nvehicles and provide helicopter survivability systems.\n  To help protect our troops from deadly improvised explosive devices, \nIEDs, I supported the addition of $60 million for the Army to purchase \nfield jamming systems $213 million for the Army to purchase Up-Armored \nHumvees. We have preserved support for C130J aircraft, so vital to \ntransporting troops and materiel around the world.\n  To ensure that we do all we can to care for soldiers when they are \ninjured, this bill includes an additional $275 million for the Defense \nHealth program. It also eliminates a petty charge to some service \nmembers recuperating from combat injuries in military facilities who \nare being asked to pay for their own meals.\n  More than 1,700 servicemen and -women have made the ultimate \nsacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan. Part of the debt of gratitude we owe \nthe families they leave behind is to ensure that they do not have to \nface a financial crisis at the same time that they are dealing with the \nloss of a loved one.\n  To help alleviate their burden, we have increased from $12,000 to \n$100,000 the Fallen Heroes compensation for family members of those \nbrave troops who make the ultimate sacrifice on behalf of our country. \nWe have applied this increase retroactively, to include all those who \nhave died since the beginning of operations in Afghanistan, and we have \nextended this compensation to apply to every service member who dies \nwhile on active duty, not just in a designated combat zone.\n  We also need to make sure that families receive the full amount of \nthis compensation. Working closely with Senator Grassley, I have taken \nsteps to ensure that the full benefit is tax free. Senator Grassley has \nassured me that this important correction will be added to the next tax \nbill considered in the Senate.\n  To further ease the strain for these families, we have allowed the \nfamily of a service member who dies to remain in military housing for a \nyear, rather than the 6 months currently allowed.\n  The veterans' health care system is stretched to the limit at a time \nwhen more and more veterans are turning to VA. That's why I supported \nan amendment by Senator Murray to increase veterans funding by $2 \nbillion to meet the health care needs of soldiers returning from Iraq \nand Afghanistan and other war veterans. Although this amendment was \ndefeated, I will continue to fight for adequate funding for veterans' \nhealth care, because the VA will continue to see more enrollment of \nveterans and a higher demand for care.\n  We know that nearly 40 percent of the soldiers deployed today in Iraq \nand Afghanistan are citizen soldiers who come from the National Guard \nand Reserves. More than half of these will suffer a loss of income when \nthey are mobilized, because their military pay is less than the pay \nfrom their civilian job.\n  Many patriotic employers and state governments eliminate this pay gap \nby continuing to pay them the difference between their civilian and \nmilitary pay. The Reservist Pay Security amendment, which I worked on \nwith Senator Durbin, will ensure that the U.S. Government also makes up \nfor this pay gap for Federal employees who are activated in the Guard \nand Reserves.\n  Americans joined the world in mourning the loss of more than 150,000 \nvictims of the Indian Ocean Tsunami last Christmas. Together, we prayed \nfor the 7 million displaced survivors that God may give them the \nstrength to persevere and overcome this, the largest natural disaster \nof our time.\n  But expressions of sympathy are not enough. As I said at the time of \nthis terrible disaster, the United States must set the example and lead \nthe world in the humanitarian effort of recovery and rebuilding.\n  So I am especially proud that this bill includes $907 million to help \nkeep America's promise to tsunami victims. It provides $656 million for \nthe Tsunami Recovery and Reconstruction fund to support on-going and \nlong-term relief efforts. It also provides $25 million for U.S. tsunami \nwarning programs to help prevent future human disasters on the scale we \nhave seen in Asia.\n  Because it is just as important to support our communities at home as \nit is to support our troops in the field, I will continue to fight for \nresponsible military budgets. For that reason, I joined Senator Byrd's \ncall for the President to fund our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \nthrough the regular budget and appropriations process. After 3 years in \nAfghanistan and 2 years in Iraq, we should not be funding these \noperations as if they were surprise emergencies.\n  I also joined Senator Byrd in his call for the President to provide \nCongress information on the costs so far of these operations and for an \nestimate of what we can expect them to cost in coming years.\n  This bill is a Federal investment in supporting our troops and their \nfamilies.\n  We support out troops by getting them the best equipment and the best \nprotection we can provide. We support them by making it easier for our \ncitizen soldiers in the National Guard and Reserves to serve their \ncountry. And we support them by ensuring that their families do not \nface a financial crisis at the moment when they are grieving the loss \nof a soldier who has sacrificed everything for our country.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I cast my vote in support of the \n2005 supplemental bill for Iraq, Afghanistan, and tsunami relief. I do \nso despite my strong objections to the administration's policy of \ncontinuing to fund our military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan \nthrough emergency supplemental bills, as if the needs of our men and \nwomen on the ground in these troubled countries comes as some sort of \nsurprise. These needs should be addressed in the regular budget request \nso that they can actually be paid for, not placed on the tab of the \nAmerican people so that debt can pile up.\n  The American people deserve honesty in budgeting, and they deserve \nstraight answers about just how long they should expect the United \nStates to continue shouldering this extremely heavy burden in Iraq. \nSome have suggested that calling for straight answers somehow \nundermines the mission at hand. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. A clear vision, clear goals, and clear plans are essential to \nsuccess. I hope the administration will articulate them soon.\n  But this tremendously irresponsible budgeting and dangerously vague \noverall strategy do not change the fact that our troops on the ground \nneed timely support, and I will cast my vote to see that they get it. I \nwas in Afghanistan and Iraq less than two months ago, and I was \ninspired by the commitment and professionalism of the service men and \nwomen I met there.\n  I was pleased the Senate adopted my amendment that would correct a \nflaw in current law that unintentionally but severely restricts the \nnumber of families of injured service members that qualify for travel \nassistance. Too many families are being denied help in visiting their \ninjured loved ones because the Army has not officially listed them as \n``seriously injured,'' even though these men and women have been \nevacuated out of the combat zone to the United States for treatment. My \namendment will provide at least one trip for families of injured \nservice members evacuated to a U.S. hospital so that these families can \nquickly reunite and begin recovering from the trauma they've \nexperienced.\n  I want to make plain that I also believe that our diplomats on the \nground in tough situations deserve our support and certainly deserve \nthe resources they need to provide for their own security. Any \nsuggestion that we can pursue our political strategy on the cheap while \nleaving the military alone responsible for the success or failure of\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\nthe U.S. intervention in Iraq is foolish. But I did vote to reduce some \nof the funds for the State Department provided in this bill, including \nfunds for the embassy in Iraq--an embassy that will be the most \nexpensive U.S. embassy in the world. These expenses simply do not \nbelong in an emergency supplemental. They are predictable, they are \nongoing, and they can be provided through the regular appropriations \nprocess.\n  I regret the managers of the bill did not seize the opportunity to \nextend the mandate of the Special Inspector General for Iraq \nreconstruction in this bill. Transparency and accountability in the \nreconstruction effort is not about finding new things to criticize. It \nis about responsible stewardship of U.S. taxpayer resources, and it is \nabout getting reconstruction right. Ultimately, it is about achieving \nour goals in Iraq. We need ongoing, vigorous, focused oversight of the \nreconstruction effort. While I was unable to get my amendment passed, I \nwill continue to work to ensure that this need is met.\n  Finally, I strongly support the tsunami relief provisions in this \nbill. The scale of this December 2004 tsunami disaster was nearly \noverwhelming, and the human losses were horrifying. I know that most of \nus here in the Congress and most Americans are firm in our resolve to \nbe strong, consistent partners to the survivors and the affected \ncommunities.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as debate about the supplemental \nappropriations for military operations and reconstruction in Iraq and \nAfghanistan comes to a close, I would like to ensure that our focus \nremains on the welfare of our Nation's troops.\n  That is why I would like to speak on behalf of the men and women who \nare serving in our Nation's Armed Forces--those currently on active \nduty as well as in the National Guard and Reserves--who are serving \ntoday in Iraq, Afghanistan, and across the globe.\n  Since the President declared an end to major combat operations in \nIraq on May 1, 2003, 1,419 American troops have died in Iraq and more \nthan 11,000 have been wounded.\n  Even if combat in Iraq is something that no longer makes the front \npages of our newspapers, it is still agonizingly clear that our troops \nremain in danger.\n  That is why it is even more important for this body to use sound \njudgment and good planning. One of my major concerns is that year after \nyear we have found a way to take the process of funding military \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan out of our regular budget process.\n  I am frustrated, quite frankly, that we have been subjected to this \nbiannual ritual. I am frustrated that questioning the timing of these \nrequests may cause our political opponents to call us unpatriotic. But, \nmost of all, I am frustrated that doing my duty as a U.S. Senator could \nbe considered anything less than keeping a sacred trust with our men \nand women in uniform.\n  In April of 2003, just a little over 2 years ago, Congress, at the \nPresident's request, provided approximately $78 billion to meet the \nchallenge in Iraq. Six months later, in October of 2003, the \nadministration came back to us and requested another $87 billion in the \nform of a supplemental appropriation to fund continuing operations in \nIraq.\n  In early June of 2004, the Senate voted for another $25 billion to \nkeep operations going through the end of that year. Now we are faced \nwith yet another emergency supplemental request of more than $80 \nbillion.\n  I agree that there is a need to adequately fund our troops. We must \ndo everything we can to protect our men and women who are in harms' \nway. What I don't understand, quite frankly, is this President's \ninability or unwillingness to make this request a part of the normal \nbudget and appropriation process that we go through every year.\n  As you recall, in April of 2003, the President requested $78 billion \nin emergency military funding. We were at the beginning of a war. \nAlthough it was a war of our choosing, I understood the uncertainty \nthat war brings. Furthermore, I understood the value of not allowing \nour enemies to get a read on our intent by peering into our budget \nprocess over the course of a year. I supported the President's request.\n  A mere 6 months later, President Bush returned to this body to \nrequest another $87 billion for ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. At that time, our troops were facing the imminent and \never-present danger of guerilla attacks.\n  Also, many of our troops were expressing concerns that they were not \nadequately trained for the specialized demands of peacekeeping and \npolicing that the reconstruction effort required.\n  Moreover, the dangers and difficulties that our troops faced went far \nbeyond the threat posed by attacks from insurgents and guerillas. I \ngrew increasingly concerned about the conditions under which many of \nour troops were being forced to serve in the Middle East.\n  I was consistently hearing about shortages of quality food and water. \nI was hearing that our troops were not properly equipped with the tools \nof warfare. I was hearing of parents sending their children bullet-\nproof vests because the military could not or would not provide them.\n  Although the administration had completely misjudged the nature of \nthis conflict, I understood that our troops must not suffer because \nothers had let them down. I understood that whatever this \nadministration's shortcomings were in terms of planning, our troops' \nsafety and well being came first. I supported the President's request.\n  Once again, in June of 2004, this administration asked for another \n$25 billion supplemental for the ongoing efforts in Iraq. At that time, \nwe were spending money in Iraq at an unexpectedly high rate, the \npromised money from Iraqi oil receipts was becoming an urban legend, \nand we were still dealing with a pervasive insurgency.\n  By June of 2004, we knew or should have known that Iraq was going to \nbe a part of this Nation's financial responsibility for some time to \ncome. But I understood that the situation was still uncertain. We had \nonly been in Iraq little more than a year and I was sure that the \nPresident's 2006 Defense budget proposal would more accurately reflect \nthe costs of the war. I understood that we could not drop the ball on \nthe welfare of our troops. I supported the President's request.\n  Now the President is requesting an additional $80 billion to support \nongoing military efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan. It seems as if we \nhave been here before. I have to ask myself, when does an ``emergency'' \nsupplemental request become sufficiently routine that it should be \nconsidered as part of our normal budget process?\n  Over the last 2 years we have been subjected to this ``emergency'' \nfour times. We have had two budgets come to Capitol Hill from this \nadministration in that time. Neither of those budgets requested one \nthin dime in support of our troops in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n  The present way in which we fund these conflicts is irresponsible and \nunsustainable. This administration, by not properly submitting this \nrequest through the normal budget and appropriations process, has \neffectively cut off our oversight role.\n  We now only have a scant few weeks to consider one of the most \nimportant pieces of funding legislation we will consider this year. \nFurthermore, as this supplemental becomes more and more routine, we run \nthe risk of hiding the true costs of the war from the American people.\n  The American people have every right to know, in as clear and \nstraightforward a manner as possible, what the financial costs of the \nwar are. By excluding those costs from the normal budget process we \nobscure the true effect of this conflict on our national debt, our \nbudget and our economy. I believe that the American people deserve more \ntransparency from us.\n  We are now at the point where poor budget planning is no longer \nacceptable. We can no longer accept the argument that unexpected events \nhave changed our outlook therefore we must have a supplemental. We know \nthat Iraq is unpredictable. We know that unforseen events occur. Our \nplanning must be flexible enough to accommodate this reality.\n  We see very clearly the effects of poor planning. We have seen it in \nthe way our troops have been inadequately equipped early on in this \nconflict. We have seen it in the way this administration has failed to \nproperly budget and has been forced to run to Congress for emergency \nfunds every 6 months.\n  In spite of the haphazard way that this administration has planned \nfor the\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\nfinancial aspects of this conflict, this Congress must keep faith with \nour troops and the American people. Part of that is making sure that we \nhold this administration and any future administrations accountable for \nproper planning.\n  We must make sure that our troops are properly equipped and provided \nfor and we must make sure that the American people have a true sense of \nthe economic impact of this war.\n  We know that we will continue to have a commitment in Iraq. The level \nof that commitment is no longer a surprise. I expect to see that \ncommitment reflected in the next Defense budget that is submitted to \nthis Congress for consideration. I do not believe that another \nsupplemental request beyond this one would be appropriate except in the \nmost extreme circumstances.\n  We must make sure that our troops are safe and have the equipment \nthey need. But, we must also make sure that the America they return to \nis stronger than the one they left. We must make sure that their \nchildren will not be burdened with the debt of our irresponsibility. We \nmust make sure that we are never accused of shirking our duty to create \nan America with more opportunity, more hope and more prosperity.\n  We can only do that when we understand that our insistence on using \nthe normal budget process to fund ongoing operations in Iraq is not an \naffront to our men and women in uniform, but rather, it is our way of \nhonoring them and the nation that they are fighting to protect.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as a cosponsor, I rise to discuss the \nDeWine/Bingaman amendment. This important measure would designate $20 \nmillion for critical election assistance, employment and public works \nprojects, and police assistance in Haiti. I am pleased that agreement \nhas been reached to include this amendment in the managers' package.\n  It has been just over a year since President Jean Bertrand Aristide \nwas forced into exile. It is well known that the United States played \nan active role in his departure. I do not wish at this time to consider \njust how great that role may have been. But as I have stated before, I \nam troubled that our Government chose to use its influence to remove a \ndemocratically elected leader--and for all of President Aristide's \nfaults, he was that--rather than working to restore stability.\n  To its credit, the United Nations Peacekeeping force in Haiti, \nMINUSTAH, has done much to reestablish security following President \nAristide's departure. I applaud those countries, particularly those \nLatin American countries, which have contributed forces. I am also \nencouraged by the work of the international community in support of the \nHaitian elections scheduled for this fall.\n  But without United States leadership, I am afraid that any temporary \nstability will be fleeting. Indeed, the Bush administration and the \ninternational community had an opportunity to become engaged in Haiti \nwell before we reached the current state of affairs. It failed to do \nso. The presence of President Aristide used to be the Bush \nadministration's excuse to not properly engage with Haiti. Right or \nwrong, that issue is no longer a factor.\n  Leadership here on the part of the Bush administration has been \nwoefully lacking. Indeed, if we continue on our present course, long-\nterm security in Haiti may be critically undermined. Most immediately, \nwithout increased United States support, the success of Haitian \nelections scheduled for this fall is in jeopardy--elections, which I \nmight point out, could do much for the stability and well-being of the \nHaitian people.\n  Mr. President, during the past year, Haitians have endured \nunimaginable hardships. Flooding in late May claimed almost 3,000 \nlives. Tropical Storm Jeanne killed nearly 2,000--making it the \ndeadliest storm this hurricane season. These catastrophes were only \ncompounded by a deteriorating security environment. They created a \nvicious cycle where widespread looting and rioting significantly \nimpeded disaster relief efforts.\n  Sadly, such violence and insecurity persists. The government lacks \ncontrol over substantial portions of the country. Armed gangs continue \nto terrorize the capital of Port-au-Prince. Elements of the former \nmilitary have occupied towns and police stations throughout the \ncountryside. Since September alone, around 400 Haitians have been \nkilled as violence spiraled out of control after an escalation in pro-\nAristide protests.\n  The ongoing disorder is perhaps best symbolized by a February 19 \nattack on Haiti's national prison. Approximately a dozen armed men \nassaulted the facility and released 481 prisoners, including drug \ndealers and other suspected criminals. The attack--which appears to \nhave been assisted from inside--is indicative of the government's \ninability to fully control even its own security forces.\n  If we are going to move toward a more hopeful future for Haiti, then \nwe need to renew our support for the Haitian people. That means, of \ncourse, working to establish basic security. Clearly, we need to reign \nin the armed gangs and former military. But that is not enough. Long-\nterm stability also requires a sustained commitment to democratic \ninstitutions and to economic development.\n  Last July, the United States pledged approximately $250 million in \naid for fiscal years 2004 and 2005. The United States provided $130 \nmillion of that assistance last year. That's a good start. But we need \nto do more.\n  Mr. President, the United Nations peacekeeping force in Haiti, \nMINUSTAH, is making important contributions to peace and stability in \nHaiti. While it was criticized for early inactivity, MINUSTAH has \nrecently stepped up its efforts to disarm former members of the Haitian \nmilitary and others. Indeed, recently two United Nations peacekeepers \nwere killed during operations to control police facilities previously \noccupied by members of the former military.\n  Despite this increase in activity, it is hard to imagine how MINUSTAH \ncan establish real security at its current force level. MINUSTAH only \nreached its full strength of approximately 7,000 military personnel and \n1,600 civilian police officers in December. Haiti also has about 4,000 \nof its own police officers, but most of these individuals are badly \ntrained and poorly armed.\n  By comparison, New York City, which has roughly the same number of \ncitizens as Haiti, is patrolled by 40,000 well trained and equipped \npolice officers. That is over three times the number of security \npersonnel as in Haiti. And it is worth noting that New York is not \nplagued by many of the problems that Haiti faces every day.\n  That is why this amendment includes funding to support police \nactivities in Haiti. A critical aspect of this assistance must be \npolice reform. Because regrettably, human rights groups report that \nsome members of the Haitian police have committed abuses, including \narbitrary arrests and, possibly, extrajudicial executions. Unless we \ncreate a climate of trust in Haiti with respect to that nation's police \nforce, there can be no lasting security. And it is difficult to build \ntrust without respect for the rule of law and the rights of \nindividuals. Any police assistance, therefore, must be used to teach \ngood policing practices, not just provide new resources for personnel, \nguns and ammunition.\n  Mr. President, the elections scheduled for this fall in Haiti could \nbe a critical step toward achieving lasting stability. After all, only \ndemocratically elected governments have the legitimacy necessary to \nfully address the persistent security and socio-economic problems \nfacing the Haitian people.\n  With assistance from the United Nations and the Organization of \nAmerican States, the Haitian government is organizing voter \nregistration and preparing the technical measures necessary to conduct \naccurate and fair polling. Smooth and successful polling operations are \nnecessary to ensure that the election outcome is never in doubt. To \nenhance the effectiveness of these efforts, this amendment would make \navailable critically needed funds for election assistance.\n  To ensure full legitimacy, however, I believe that the Haitian \ngovernment must also take steps to re-engage with the Lavalas family \nparty of President Aristide, which has threatened to boycott the \nelections. The Lavalas party is the largest and best organized party in \nHaiti, and without its participation, I am concerned that the election \nresults will not be accepted by the Haitian people.\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\n  A critical step toward re-engaging the Lavalas party would be \nreleasing former Prime Minister Neptune and any other Lavalas party \nmembers who are currently being held without formal charges being \nbrought against them by Haitian authorities. To that end, I, along with \nseveral of my colleagues, wrote to Prime Minister Latortue requesting \nthat he inform us on what charges the former Prime Minister is being \nheld, and if there are no formal charges filed, to release him \nimmediately. I have yet to receive an answer from the Haitian \ngovernment.\n  But in the long-term, no single election can eliminate the \ninstability and disorder that has afflicted the Haitian people for \ncenturies. These problems have their root in persistent poverty and \neconomic dislocation, and they can only be resolved through active \nengagement by the United States.\n  Haiti is the poorest country in the western hemisphere; 65 percent of \nthe population lives below the poverty line. The average income is \n$250. Life expectancy is a mere 53 years, and half of the population \ndoes not have access to clean drinking water. Only 50 percent of the \npopulation works in the formal economy. In such an environment, is it \nany wonder that Haiti has suffered from years of violence and disorder?\n  Sadly, children are particularly affected by these impoverished \nconditions. Over one in ten Haitian children dies before age five. \nApproximately 20 percent of all children suffer from malnourishment. \nHaiti also has the highest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the western \nhemisphere, and 4,000 to 6,000 children in Haiti are born with the \nvirus each year. Yet according to the World Bank, in the 1990's, there \nwere only two physicians for every 10,000 Haitians. That figure is \nunlikely to have improved. To combat the effects of such abject \npoverty, this amendment would provide assistance for employment \nprojects.\n  For many Haitians, moreover, economic progress is impossible because \nthey lack access to needed infrastructure. There are not enough roads, \nschools or hospitals. That is why funds designated by this amendment \nwould also be available for important public works.\n  Lastly, I encourage my colleagues to use the benefits of trade to \nhelp the Haitian people. Last Congress, I was proud to cosponsor \nSenator DeWine's HERO Act. This important legislation would have helped \nreinvigorate the Haitian economy by granting preferential trade \ntreatment to certain Haitian textile products. I was pleased that the \nSenate passed this bill last year. Unfortunately, it met opposition in \nthe other body. I hope we can make that legislation a priority in the \n109th Congress.\n  Mr. President, in 1994, the United States launched an armed \nintervention to reestablish Haitian democracy. Last year, the United \nStates again sent a contingent of Marines to restore stability. Too \noften in our history, our neglect of Haiti's most basic problems have \nleft us with no choice but to intervene when instability breaks out \ninto open crisis. Only through proactive leadership and a commitment to \nlong-term development in Haiti can we break this cycle. For all these \nreasons, I am pleased that this amendment has been accepted as part of \nthe managers' package. I urge the conferees to ensure that this \nlanguage is included in the conference agreement of this bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to address several amendments \noffered to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill this week. We \nare debating this emergency appropriation primarily to see to the needs \nof the men and women who are serving on the front line in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. That's because it's our job to make sure that our troops \nget the support and the resources they need when they need them.\n  But there is another front line we should not forget about, and that \nincludes the home front. And serving on the home front are the men and \nwomen of the National Guard, Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs \nagents, as well as the police forces who serve in big and small \ncommunities alike.\n  They, too, need resources and support from Congress. And while we \nhave a process by which Congress determines on a yearly basis what \nthose needs are, I am not content to just wait and see. I am concerned \nabout the fate of important legislation that was passed last fall that \nauthorized putting more border patrol agents on our front line--which \nmore and more often is up on the highline of Montana, and not only \nacross desert stretches on the Southern border.\n  That legislation, which was negotiated as part of the National \nIntelligence Reform Act of 2004 and signed by President Bush, \nrecognized for more personnel patrolling our borders. Now, while the \nadministration's fiscal year 2006 budget did not propose the funding \ncalled for in that legislation, it is up to all of us in Congress to \nmake sure that the border patrol gets the help it needs. That is why I \nam a cosponsor of Senator Byrd's amendment to deliver the funds our \nborder security personnel deserve.\n  But we have to do more. We need to help the border patrol and other \nFederal and State law enforcement agencies get their workload under \ncontrol and focus on the most serious threats to our Nation's security.\n  Surely, we all want to know who the millions of undocumented aliens \nare who cross our borders each year. And many of these people live and \nwork amongst us. The vast majority of these undocumented workers are \nhere because there are jobs--in the service, agricultural or other \nsectors--for which employers cannot find willing American workers.\n  As long as tough standards are in place for (1) proving that no \nwilling American workers could be found, (2) documenting the background \nof the worker and the nature of the work, and (3) consequences for \nbreaking the law, I think we are a safer Nation when we encourage \nillegal migrants and their employers to come out from the shadows and \nshow themselves.\n  Encouraging employers and foreign workers to work within the bounds \nof law will allow our border agents to better focus their efforts on \nthose who would enter the country to do our citizens harm. And up on \nthe Northern border, what used to be our nation's backdoor and is \nquickly becoming the front door, we face that more unlikely threat \nprecisely because all eyes are on the southern border.\n  I'm not talking about amnesty, and I'm not talking about rushing into \nsome sweeping immigration reform. I think that requires broader and \nmore considered deliberation by Congress. But it does make sense to \nbegin to document and track the movement of illegal migrants who would \notherwise pay taxes and abide by our laws if they could earn the chance \nto do so. This in turn helps our small and seasonal businesses maintain \na reliable, screened and legal workforce, and it allows us to focus our \nattention on stopping would-be terrorists from crossing our borders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read \na third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

I move to reconsider the vote by which the bill was \npassed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment, requests a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair appoints Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Specter, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bond, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Burns, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Craig, \nMrs. Hutchison, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Allard, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reid of Nevada, Mr. \nKohl, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, \nand Ms. Landrieu conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank all Senators for their \ncooperation in the passage of this bill. There were a lot of amendments \noffered, and we agreed to some of them. Some of them were adopted. We \nare going to conference with the House now to work out differences \nbetween the two bills. I am confident we will be able to come back with \na product in the form of a conference report which the Senate can \nsupport, which will continue to support the additional funding that is \nneeded for this fiscal year for our troops in the field, for those who \nare deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere in the world in the \nwar on terror, and will meet the needs of our State Department through \nreplenishment of accounts that have been depleted because of the \ndisaster in the tsunami episode and for other needs the Senate and \nHouse have seen fit to include in this appropriations bill.\n  As my first bill to manager on the floor of the Senate as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, I have to give great credit to the \nassistance I received personally from staff members here in the Senate, \nother Senators as well who are more experienced and who chaired \nimportant subcommittees in the past and this full committee, as a \nmatter of fact.\n  Specifically, I am thinking about Senator Byrd, the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, who has served as chairman of this \ncommittee and ranking member of the committee; Senator Stevens, who is \nchairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee; Senator Inouye, \nwho is the senior Democrat on that subcommittee, both of whom helped \nshape the content of this bill in areas under the jurisdiction of their \nsubcommittee; and the staff director, Keith Kennedy, who is back from a \nleave of absence he had doing other things for the last several years \nbut who, as a former staff director of this committee, provided strong \nleadership for our staff and gave me tremendous support which I needed \nto get this bill to this point. I am very grateful to him for his \nsupport and those who worked closely with him, like Terry Sauvain on \nthe Democratic side; Sid Ashworth, who is the clerk of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee, and her counterpart on the Democratic \nside, Charlie Houy; Paul Grove; Tim Rieser; Clayton Heil, who is \ncounsel to the committee; and Chuck Kieffer, all of whom provided very \nimportant and appreciated support to me during the handling of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we bring to a close the debate on the \nemergency supplemental, H.R. 1268, I thank my good friend from the \nState of Mississippi, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nThad Cochran. Senator Cochran was recently installed as the new \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee, and, although he has managed \nnumerous bills on the floor in the past, this is the first \nappropriations bill that he has managed as the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. I compliment Senator Cochran for a job well \ndone, and I especially thank him for his patience. In fact, all of the \nMembers should thank him for his patience. We have been on this bill \nfor the better part of 2 weeks, and we have given consideration to \nmany, many amendments. Throughout all of these many days of debate on \nthe underlying bill and on the numerous amendments offered by both \nsides, Senator Cochran has kept a level head, and he has shown patience \nin seeing that this supplemental is processed in an orderly manner and \nthat no Member is denied an opportunity to have input on this bill.\n  I also join with Senator Cochran in expressing gratitude to the staff \nmembers on both sides of the aisle who helped us with processing this \nbill and all those amendments. They worked late into the evening hours \non some of these matters, and I appreciate not only their hard work but \nalso their unstinting dedication to this institution.\n  Mr. President, this is only one in a series of supplemental requests \nthat have come from the administration asking the Congress to \nappropriate more funds for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and for \nreconstruction efforts in those countries. With approval of this \nsupplemental, we will have approved over $280 billion for the two wars \nthrough emergency supplemental bills. We should not continue to fund \nthese wars in this way. This is not the chairman's fault. He can only \nrespond to the administration's proposals. It is evident that many of \nmy colleagues are in agreement that funding for war activities should \nbe processed in regular annual appropriations measures, not through \nemergency supplementals. This was clearly and emphatically expressed \nagain in of the sense of the Senate amendment earlier this week. I hope \nthat this administration will take serious note of the Senate's strong \nview in this regard.\n  I assure my colleagues here today and the people of this country that \nI fully and wholeheartedly support our men and women in uniform. I give \nthese troops my gratitude and my respect. I wish that we could give \nthem more--I wish that we could give them a clearly defined mission, \nwith a clearly defined strategy for ending the war in Iraq and coming \nhome.\n  But, this administration is not winding down its military operations \nin Iraq--that is evident from the size of this most recent request \nsubmitted by the President. To the contrary, it appears that the United \nStates may be gearing up either to accommodate a permanent military \npresence in Iraq or to establish a launching pad for other military \noperations in the region. This, certainly, would be the wrong message \nto send to the people of Iraq and others in the region. I pray that \nthis is not the case.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4094-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we have completed a tremendously \nimportant piece of legislation for the funding of our troops in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. During this afternoon, I, along with Senator \nDanny Akaka, my ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and \nSenator Mike DeWine, added an amendment I want to speak for a few \nmoments about because I think it addresses a tremendous gap in the \ncoverage that exists in the treatment of the soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and airmen who are fighting for our country at this very \nmoment.\n  Our amendment addresses the coverage gap through the creation of a\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\nnew traumatic injury protection insurance program for the benefit of \nseverely disabled service members. But before I describe the amendment, \nlet me further discuss the nature of the problem our amendment attempts \nto attend.\n  It is widely known that due to the incredible advances in medicine, \nservice members who may not have survived life-threatening injuries in \nprevious wars are now making it back home alive from Iraq and \nAfghanistan. That is the good news. The bad news, however, is that they \nmust live with injuries that may have left them without their limbs, \nsight, hearing, or speech ability, or even more. All of my colleagues \nhave likely met these brave young men and women in their home visits or \nright here in Washington, DC, at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. They \nare fighting for their lives. They are attempting to learn, through \nphysical and occupational therapy, how to reengage back into society, \nneedless to say, relearning things I and my colleagues probably take \nfor granted every day--how to walk, how to read, how to simply make \nbreakfast in the morning and what, for them, can take months and quite \npossibly years to learn how to redo.\n  It is during this rehabilitation period at military hospitals the \nneed for additional financial resources becomes most acute. For many \nGuard and Reserve members at Walter Reed, they already have foregone \nhigher paying civilian jobs prior to their deployment. Lengthy recovery \nperiods simply add to the financial stress they bear. In addition, \nfamily members of injured soldiers bear the burdens necessary to travel \nfrom great distances to provide the love and emotional support that is \nabsolutely essential for any successful rehabilitation. Spouses quit \njobs to spend time with their husbands at the hospital, or husbands \nquit jobs to spend time with their wives. Parents spare no expense to \nbe with their injured children.\n  To meet these needs, our amendment would create a traumatic injury \nprotection insurance rider as part of an existing service member's \ngroup life insurance program. The traumatic insurance would provide \ncoverage for severely disabling conditions at a cost of approximately \n$1 a month for participating service members. The payment for those \nsuffering a severe disability would be immediate and would range from \n$25,000 to a maximum of $100,000. Of course, that is to tide them over \nduring this period before the other benefits we all know about kick in.\n  The purpose of the immediate payment would be to give injured service \nmembers and their families the financial cushion they need to sustain \nthem before their medical discharge from the service, when veterans \nbenefits kick in.\n  The traumatic injuries covered under our amendment include total and \npermanent loss of sight, loss of hands or feet, total or permanent loss \nof speech, total or permanent loss of hearing, quadriplegia or \nparaplegia, burns greater than second degree, covering 30 percent of \nthe body or face, certain traumatic brain injuries.\n  Most of the amendment is entirely reasonable given the cause. \nInformal CBO estimates put the fiscal year 2006 cost at about $10 \nmillion, a very small price to pay to meet the needs of those wounded \nwarriors.\n  I cannot take credit for the idea behind this amendment. The great \ncredit must go to disabled veterans from the Wounded Warrior Project, \nrun under the aegis of the United Spinal Association. Three Wounded \nWarrior veterans from the Iraq war visited my office last week to \ndiscuss the need to provide this type of an insurance benefit.\n  One veteran, former Army Staff Sergeant Heath Calhoun, had both of \nhis legs amputated after being struck during a rocket-propelled grenade \nattack in Iraq. Heath and his wife, Tiffany, who was present with him \nin my office, described the financial problems they had endured after \nTiffany quit her job to be with Heath during convalescence. It took \nover a year before Heath was medically discharged from service. While \nthe Calhoun family was able to make it through, it was an extremely \ntrying period. Heath told me he was adamant that other servicemen in \nIraq should not have to worry about finances, should they, too, be \ninjured.\n  The quickest way to accomplish that, he told me, was to add a \ndisability insurance rider, financed by service members through monthly \npremium deductions, to the existing life insurance program.\n  I am honored to sponsor that amendment. It is now in the legislation \nthat passed the Senate. The White House endorses it. The Defense \nDepartment endorses it. We had a press conference yesterday with the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs, Jim Nicholson, and the head of personnel \nat the DOD.\n  I want to also personally compliment Ryan Kelly, who was a visitor \nalso with me this past week. Mr. Kelly lost his right leg during an \nambush near Baghdad almost 21 months ago. I am told he was a principal \nauthor of the draft legislation that culminated in the amendment we \noffered here this afternoon. I thank him for the tremendously fine work \nhe did.\n  I also thank President Bush, of course--I just mentioned him--and his \ntop administration officials for lending their support to this \namendment. Secretary Nicholson, Defense Deputy Secretary of Defense \nPaul Wolfowitz, and their staffs provided invaluable technical support \nin drafting this amendment.\n  The supplemental already would make substantial improvements to \nbenefits provided to survivors of those killed in the line of duty. I \napplaud all of those efforts for our veterans and their survivors. I \nalso remind my colleagues we must be vigilant in our care for those who \nare still fighting to regain the normalcy of the lives they enjoyed \nprior to sustaining catastrophic injuries in the defense of our \nfreedoms. We now have moved this from an idea to an amendment, and now \ninto the legislation that passed. I thank my colleagues in the Senate \nfor their unanimous support of what is a very important piece of \nlegislation that fills a hole and sustains a family and sustains a \nwarrior in his or her greatest time of need--that of recovering from a \ntraumatic injury and moving into civilian or military whole life again. \nI thank my colleagues for their support. I yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            BORDER SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I feel very strongly that we must \nincrease our border security. The resources of our National Guard, law \nenforcement, and Customs and Border Patrol agents are stretched way too \nthin and they need our help, especially along the northern border. \nTheir ability to successfully carry out their daily duties is of \ncritical importance to the safety of all Americans.\n  We must protect our borders better and work to increase the \napprehension of illegal aliens crossing into the United States.\n  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act we passed in \n2004 authorized the hiring of 2,000 new Border Patrol agents. Yet the \nPresident's budget only proposed 210 new agents--about 10 percent of \nwhat is authorized.\n  The Border Patrol has been dangerously underfunded. That is why I \ncosponsored Senator Byrd's Border Patrol amendment, which passed \nyesterday, and why I supported Senator Ensign's amendment today.\n  I recognize we are fighting the war on terrorism overseas, but we \nneed more agents, investigators, detention, and deportation officers at \nhome.\n  Additional funding will ensure that more illegal aliens will be \ndetained and our borders will be tightened against all threats, \nespecially terrorism. The best way to prevent terrorism in the United \nStates is to prevent terrorists from entering the United States.\n  In my State of Montana, we deal with the vast northern border and the \nterrain is not easy to patrol. As you can imagine, as the southern \nborder is tightened, our northern border, which used to be America's \nback door, is quickly becoming the front door. We need more agents; it \nis that simple. That border is long. Agents can only cover so much \nterritory. The agents need training and facilities.\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\n  In addition to personnel and training, we must also employ the latest \ntechnologies. The Border Patrol conducted successful tests using \nunmanned aerial vehicles--around here known as UAVs--along the \nsouthwest border in Arizona for surveillance and detection of \nindividuals attempting to enter the U.S. illegally. Unfortunately, \nthose operations were ceased at the end of January of this year. \nThankfully, the funds provided in Senator Byrd's amendment will allow \nfor the immediate resumption of these surveillance and detection \noperations. UAVs are a safe alternative to placing civilians in harm's \nway.\n  It is up to all of us in Congress--not just today, but in future days \nand weeks and months--to make sure the Border Patrol gets the help it \nneeds. We must deliver the funds our border security personnel deserve \nto continue their work of apprehending illegal aliens, fighting the war \non terrorism, and keeping the homefront safe.\n  I might add, it also applies to methamphetamines. There is a lot of \nthat coming into our country across our borders. It is a huge problem. \nI daresay virtually every State in the Nation has a significant \nmethamphetamine problem, and too much is being used by citizens in \nStates. A lot of it is manufactured locally, but a lot is also \nimported. So more Border Patrol agents will help us fight not only \nterrorism, but the scourge of methamphetamines.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4096-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4096-S4097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESERVING SENATE RULES\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, engraved in stone on the panel behind \nthe Presiding Officer are the words ``E pluribus unum''--``Out of many, \none.''\n  The words also appear on the seal of the Senate, which appears on the \nflag the Senators see to the right of the Presiding Officer. It is one \nof my favorite mottos. It is the motto of the United States of America. \nThe words mean, ``One unity, formed from many parts.'' They represent \nthe Senate well. For it is here in the Senate our Nation has been \nbrought together. It is here in the Senate our Nation's leaders have \nworked out many of the great compromises that have bridged the issues \nof the day. It is here in the Senate that disparate interests in our \nNation have become one.\n  The Senate is a place of unity, a place of compromise, and a place of \nconsensus, because of its rules. The Senate works to force unity, not \nbecause its rules make it easy to get things done, but because the \nrules make it so hard. Because the Senate's rules require Senators to \nassemble majorities of three-fifths, and sometimes two-thirds, the \nrules force Senators to find policy positions that appeal more broadly, \nthat transcend party, that bring more Senators together.\n  Because its rules make it so hard to get things done, the Senate does \nmuch of its work through the ultimate expression of unity--through \nunanimous consent.\n  Because the Senate's rules make it hard to get things done, Senators \nmust work together to get things done. Because the Senate's rules make \nit hard to get things done, no Senator may completely disrespect a \nsecond Senator because a second Senator might hold up the first \nSenator's legislation.\n  Because the rules make it harder to get things done, the Senate has \ncollegiality and comity. It is that simple. The rules make it harder to \nget things done, and that forces us together. Because the Senate rules \nmake it harder to get things done, Senators of one party must reach out \nto the moderates of another party.\n  Let me state for the record, as my colleagues already know, I am one \nof those moderates. Since 1978, I have worked in this Chamber to put \nMontana first, to use common sense, to be effective, and to get things \ndone. Because of the way the Senate works and because of the way I \nwork, that has meant working together with other Senators, often across \nthe aisle.\n  I have worked together with Republicans to cut taxes, to reform \nenvironmental laws, to open international markets to American trade, \nand to update Medicare to provide prescription drugs. Why? Because all \nthose are important, and it is important to work together to get those \nthings done.\n  One of the reasons moderates, like me, of both parties can move \ncompromises and consensus legislation is because the rules of the \nSenate require getting more than a simple majority.\n  Contrast that with the House of Representatives. There the rules make \nit easy to get things done. But there, it is a rare exception when \nMembers craft legislation to appeal broadly, across party lines. There \nthe majority passes the legislation that represents the strongest \nachievable expression of the majority party's position. Unity is not \ntheir goal.\n  One might call the result majority rule, but the reality is that the \nproduct of the House of Representatives often represents an even \nsmaller fraction. The rules of the House of Representatives often \nencourage a majority of those in the majority party to decide policy \nand then to enforce that policy within the majority caucus. Because its \nrules make it so easy to get things done, Representatives of one party \nsteamroll the moderates of their own party, let alone of the other \nparty.\n  Thus, the rules of the House of Representatives foster sharper \npartisan division between the two parties. The rules of the Senate lead \nto the result: ``Out of many, one.'' The rules of the House lead to the \nresult: ``Out of many, two.''\n  The Senate's rules are particularly important to a State with a small \npopulation, such as my home State of Montana. This is particularly true \nin light of the small House delegation that such small States have. \nMontana, as several other States, has one Representative in the House. \nStates such as Montana rely on their Senators to allow their relatively \ngreater influence to protect their interests. Without the Senate rules, \nrural America would have a much harder time getting heard. Sometimes it \nis good that the Senate's rules require more than a thin majority, in \norder to make sure that every part of the country is truly represented.\n  Fundamental to the Senate's rules, for two centuries, has been the \nright to extended debate. In the First Congress, Senators debated at \nlength the permanent site for the Capitol. In 1811, the House of \nRepresentatives provided that a motion for the previous question could \ncut off further debate. But the Senate rules have not included such a \nmotion since the 1806 codification of the rules. We cannot summarily \ncut off debate, as the House can. And even after the Senate adopted \nrule XXII of cloture in 1917, the Senate rules have required a \nsupermajority to bring debate to a close. Since its revision in 1979, \nrule XXII has required the affirmative vote of 60 Senators to limit \ndebate.\n  Thus, for two centuries, Democrats and Republicans alike have used \nthe Senate's rules to protect the rights of the minority party. After \ntwo centuries, it would be a mistake to change those rules.\n  Extended debate allows Senators to protect minority interests. \nExtended debate gives life to the traditional story that Washington \ntold Jefferson that, like pouring coffee into a saucer, ``we pour \nlegislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it.'' Extended debate \nmakes the Senate, in Aaron Burr's words, ``a sanctuary; a citadel of \nlaw, of order, and of liberty.''\n  The Senate's rules thus help to protect personal rights and \nliberties. The Senate's rules help to ensure that no one party has \nabsolute power. The Senate's rules help to give effect to the Founder's \nconception of checks and balances.\n  The Senate's right of extended debate is particularly important in \nthe context of nominations for the lifetime jobs of Federal judges.\n  At the Constitutional Convention, the Founders debated different ways \nto appoint judges. On June 13, 1787, James Madison of Virginia proposed \nthat the Senate make the appointments to protect the integrity, the \nindependence of the third article; that is, the judges of the United \nStates of America. On June 15, William Paterson of New Jersey\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nproposed that the President make the appointments. On July 18, \nNathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts proposed a compromise, that the \nPresident make the appointment with the advice and consent of the \nSenate. That is, they both decide; not just the President, not just the \nSenate, they both do, again, to protect the integrity of the \nindependence of our Federal judiciary.\n  The history of the Constitutional Convention thus demonstrates that \nthe Founders hoped that both the President and the Senate could be \ninvolved in the process.\n  In its application, the Senate's involvement in the confirmation of \njudges has helped to ensure that nominees have had the support of a \nbroad political consensus. The Senate's involvement has helped to \nensure that the President could not appoint extreme nominees. The \nSenate's involvement has thus helped to ensure that judges have been \nfreer of partisanship and, in fact, more independent.\n  The Founders wanted the courts to be an independent branch of \nGovernment, helping to exercise the Constitution's intricate systems of \nchecks and balances. The Senate's involvement in the confirmation of \njudges has helped to ensure that the judiciary can be that more \nindependent branch. And that independence of the judiciary, in turn, \nhas helped to ensure the protection of personal rights and liberties in \nour country.\n  It is important that we get good judges. Over the years, this has \nbeen one of the issues of greatest importance to me as a Senator. That \nis why I worked to set up a merit selection system that is truly \napolitical to select judges that I recommend to the President from \nmy State of Montana. The Senate's rules help to make a merit selection \npossible.\n\n  I invite my colleagues to read the inscription in the marble relief \nover the Senate's door to my left. There is inscribed a single word: \n``Courage.'' That is what preserving the Senate's rules will require: \ncourage to stand up to the extremists; courage to stand up to the \nmajority of one's party; courage to save the institution itself.\n  For Senators of either party, the simplest thing is usually to vote \nwith the party. Voting with the party makes it easier to go to the \nparty caucus lunch. Voting with the party makes it easier to hang on to \na committee chairmanship.\n  To preserve this Senate will take the courage of at least six \nSenators in the majority party who are willing to vote for the \ninstitution first before their comfort at party lunches. It will take \nthe courage of six Senators in the majority party who are willing to \nrisk their chairmanships to protect the Senate--indeed, the country \nitself.\n  Let me offer this encouragement. I recall a decade ago in 1995, \nSenator Mark Hatfield from Oregon, who was then the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, told his majority leader, Senator Bob Dole, \nthat he would rather resign from the Senate than vote for the \nconstitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. Luckily, Senator \nDole did not accept Senator Hatfield's offer, and Senator Dole later \nwrote:\n\n       While I strongly disagreed with his position, I also \n     respected any Senator's right to vote their conscience.\n\n  In retrospect, Republican Senators should see it was lucky for them \nthat Senator Hatfield voted as he did. For if the Constitution required \na balanced budget, it would have required the majority party to make \nmassive cuts in Government services during the 5 years of deficits and, \nthus, if the Constitution required a balanced budget, the voters would \nhave long ago punished Republican Senators for the cuts they would have \nmade. They should thank Senator Hatfield that it did not pass. In the \nend, the sacrifices of these times ask that six Senators of the \nmajority party stand up. The sacrifices that these times ask of six \nSenators from the majority party pales next to those of an earlier \ngeneration. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson \nselected the words ``e pluribus unum'' as the Nation's motto on August \n10, 1776. That was barely a month after they had published the \ndocument, the Declaration of Independence, in which they had written:\n\n       We mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes \n     and our sacred Honor.\n\n  Just think of the courage of our Founding Fathers when they wrote the \nDeclaration of Independence to break away from England knowing if they \nwere apprehended, they would all be hanged. They knew that. Just think \nof their courage.\n  On the occasion of signing the Declaration, Benjamin Franklin is said \nto have warned: We must all hang together or surely we will all hang \nseparately.\n  Our Founders sought unity from the very beginning. For unity, they \nwere willing to risk their fortunes. For unity, they were willing to \nrisk their lives. How many here can say that?\n  Today, to preserve the rules of the Senate that so foster unity, six \nSenators will be asked to risk much less. To preserve this Senate, they \nneed not offer their fortunes. To preserve this Senate, they need not \noffer their lives. But to preserve this Senate, they will need to offer \ntheir courage.\n  I call on my colleagues in the majority to follow the exhortations \nengraved on the west door. I call on my colleagues to recall the \ncourage of our Founders who risked their lives to give us this sacred \ninheritance of checks and balances. I call on my colleagues to summon \nthe courage to vote against the effort to change the rules that make \nthe Senate the place we love so much, that would change the Senate so \nmuch so that it will dramatically undermine the protection of liberties \nand the protection of our rights that so many Americans look to us to \nenforce.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn).

Mr. President, on Tuesday, I introduced the Global Health \nCorps Act of 2005.\n  As a doctor who has traveled the world treating patients in desperate \nand war-ravaged lands, this cause is near and dear to my heart.\n  I believe, and I have seen, through the good works of many talented \nand compassionate men and women, that medicine is not only an \ninstrument of health, but a currency of peace. Healing gives hope. And \nI have seen that real, tangible, medical intervention can help bridge \nthe gaps and misunderstandings that so often divide cultures.\n  We see that phenomenon in Afghanistan and Iraq. And we saw it in \nSouth East Asia in the aftermath of the terrible tsunami tragedy.\n  Immediately, American military ships, planes and helicopters arrived \nto deliver food, water, medicine and tents to the devastated region. \nThe U.S. Agency for International Development set up a 24-hour, 7-day-\na-week, Disaster Response Command Center here in Washington and abroad.\n  Thousands of private citizens, religious groups, small businesses and \nlarge corporations sent tens of millions of dollars in donations to \nhelp aid the people of South East Asia. Many continue to keep giving. \nAmerica's response, both official and private, was a portrait in \ncompassion.\n  I had the opportunity to travel to the region with the distinguished \nSenator Mary Landrieu days after the tsunami struck. Together, we \nsurveyed the damage, assessed the humanitarian needs, and witnessed \nAmerican compassion in action.\n  We spoke to doctors, nurses, officials and victims. One doctor I met \nin Sri Lanka told me a remarkable story of compassion. He had e-mailed \na plea for help just as the massive wave swamped his hospital. Within 2 \ndays, a team of Scandinavian physicians who had seen the e-mail arrived \nto set up a pediatric ward.\n  Countless health care professionals from all over the world, both \nvolunteers and government workers, rushed to the devastated region to \noffer assistance and supplies.\n  The outpouring of support from the world community, led by American \nefforts, was truly extraordinary--a moving testament to our shared \nhumanity.\n  America is a giving nation. Indeed, America provides 60 percent of \nall food humanitarian relief in the world. Moreover, the generosity of \nprivate citizens significantly amplifies official efforts.\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\n  It is this spirit of generosity that the Global Health Corps seeks to \nharness. America possesses a vast reservoir of talent, knowledge, and \ncompassion that can help heal, both literally and figuratively, our \nglobal ties.\n  It was the famed violinist, Yehudi Menhuhin, who said:\n\n       Peace may sound simple--one beautiful word--but it requires \n     everything we have, every quality, every strength, every \n     dream, every high ideal.\n\n  Providing health care services and training to those in need is one \npositive step we can take to demonstrate our goodwill and high ideals, \nand by doing so, plant the seeds of hope and peace.\n  The purpose of the Global Health Corps is twofold.\n  First and foremost, the Health Corps will help to improve the health, \nwelfare, and development of communities in foreign countries and \nregions abroad.\n  In too many places, simple things like vaccinations, first aid, clean \nwater, and hygiene are unknown or woefully inadequate. Men, women and \nchildren especially children--suffer terrible illnesses that can be \neasily prevented with basic health services.\n  The Health Corps bill seeks to provide a range of services from rapid \nrelief, like what we saw following the tsunami, to long-term assistance \nto address endemic public health issues. It provides services such as \nveterinary care, which is very important in developing countries, where \nlivestock are frequently a family's means of nutrition, commerce, and \nwealth.\n  A new Institute of Medicine survey issued today reports that one of \nthe biggest obstacles to fighting HIV/AIDS in Africa is the severe \nshortage of medical personnel.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa has 25 percent of the world's HIV/AIDS cases, but \nonly 1.3 percent of the world's health force. In Rwanda, for example, \nthere are less than two doctors per 100,000 people.\n  If we are to maximize our help to these countries, we need to \nstrengthen the medical delivery systems on the ground. HIV/AIDS \nmedicine does no good sitting in boxes. Vaccines can't protect children \nfrom preventable diseases if there is no one to administer the shots. \nStrengthening the local infrastructure and teaching local citizens \nbasic health skills will go a long way to addressing their medical \nneeds.\n  The second goal of the Global Health Corps is to deploy health care \nassistance as a tool of public diplomacy. John F. Kennedy recognized \nthat our assistance to other nations carries the most weight when it \ninvolves personal, intimate contact on the community level and provides \ntangible benefits to everyday people. This is why he established the \nPeace Corps, and why this bill taps into the Peace Corps for \nvolunteers.\n  The new Global Health Corps will draw together health care \nprofessionals and volunteers from around the Nation, from both the \nprivate and public sectors.\n  Some Health Corps volunteers will be seasoned doctors, nurses, and \nmedical technicians. Others will enter the program with simply a \npassion for public health, a willingness to learn, and a desire to help \nothers.\n  The U.S. Government is already doing a great deal of work in these \nareas. But the Global Health Corps will pull it all together, \ncoordinate and focus our efforts, and tap into the private sector both \nprivate organizations and individuals--to multiply our efforts.\n  Like members of the Peace Corps and our many volunteers abroad, the \nGlobal Health Corps will serve as a shining example of the American \npeople, our charity and goodwill.\n  In a speech in San Francisco on the eve of the 1960 Presidential \nelection, John F. Kennedy made the stark but compassionate observation \nthat:\n\n       There is not enough money in all America to relieve the \n     misery of the undeveloped world in a giant and endless soup \n     kitchen. But there is enough know-how and enough \n     knowledgeable people to help those nations help themselves.\n\n  Indeed, as the famous proverb counsels:\n\n       Give a man a fish and he's fed for a day. Teach him how to \n     fish and he will be fed all of his life.\n\n  I am proud that Senator Lugar, Chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, is co-sponsoring my bill. I urge my colleagues to \njoin us in this vital mission.\n  In a world that is ever more connected by planes and computers, \nmarkets and movements, our fate is bound ever closer with that of our \nneighbors--near and far, wealthy and poor. I call upon my colleagues to \nadvance our common humanity. Helping heal others abroad--and showing \nthem America's heart--will help all of us stay safer at home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4098-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4098-S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SUPPORTING COPS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, combating violent crime, especially gun \ncrime, requires that our law enforcement agencies are adequately \nstaffed and equipped. I have been a strong supporter of the Community \nOriented Policing Services, COPS, program. The COPS Program has been \ncritical to our Nation's law enforcement community since its creation \nin 1994, and I am pleased to join Senator Biden as a cosponsor of the \nCOPS Reauthorization Act.\n  The COPS Program was designed to assist State and local law \nenforcement agencies in hiring additional police officers to reduce \ncrime through the use of community policing. In Michigan alone, 514 \nlocal and State law enforcement agencies have received more than $220 \nmillion in grants through the COPS Program since its creation. These \ngrants have improved the safety of communities by putting more than \n3,300 law enforcement officers on Michigan streets and by supporting \nother important programs. Nationwide, the COPS Program has awarded more \nthan $11 billion in grants, resulting in the hiring of 118,000 \nadditional police officers.\n  In my home State, the Detroit Police Department, DPD, used a COPS \ngrant to hire additional officers that were needed to implement a 5-\nyear community policing plan. Prior to the COPS grant award, the DPD \nlacked sufficient personnel to effectively cover high crime areas. The \ncommunity policing plan placed teams of officers in neighborhoods to \ncombat rising crime rates and work with residents to develop crime \nreduction strategies. The plan resulted in a drop in the number of \nreported violent crimes as well as improved police-community relations. \nThe success of the Detroit Police Department illustrates the important \nrole that COPS grants play in the safety of communities around the \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, authorization for the COPS Program was permitted to \nexpire at the end of fiscal year 2000. Although the program has \nsurvived through the annual appropriations process, it has received \nsignificant funding cuts. In fact, the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus \nAppropriations Act included only $606 million for the COPS Program, \n$142 million below the amount appropriated in 2004. In addition, \nPresident Bush's fiscal year 2006 budget would completely eliminate the \nCOPS hiring grants. Despite the important positive impact of the COPS \nProgram in Detroit and across the country, the President justified his \ncuts by calling the program ``nonperforming'' and not having ``a record \nof demonstrating results.'' Our State and local law enforcement \nagencies know better and we should listen to them.\n  The COPS Reauthorization Act would continue the COPS Program for \nanother 6 years at a funding level of $1.15 billion per year. This \nfunding would allow State and local governments to hire an additional \n50,000 police officers over the next 6 years. In addition, the bill \nwould modernize the COPS Program by authorizing $350 million in law \nenforcement technology grants to assist police departments in acquiring \nnew technologies for the analysis of crime data and the examination of \nDNA evidence, among other uses. The COPS Reauthorization Act would also \nbuild upon the accomplishments of the original COPS Program by \nauthorizing $200 million in community prosecutor grants. These grants \nwould be used to hire community prosecutors trained to work at the \nlocal and neighborhood level to prevent crime and improve relations \nwith residents.\n  At a time when we are asking more of our police departments than ever \nbefore, I believe we should be devoting more resources to the COPS \nProgram, not less. The increased threat of terrorism as well as the \ncontinuing epidemic of gun violence underscores the\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\nneed for more resources for our law enforcement agencies. Recognizing \nthis, we must build upon the past success of the COPS Program and \ncontinue to work to provide police departments with the tools and \nresources they need to help keep our families and communities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4099-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I speak about the need for hate crimes \nlegislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce hate crimes \nlegislation that would add new categories to current hate crimes law, \nsending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable in our \nsociety. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to highlight \na separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  Last month, a fifth person was arrested and charged with beating up a \nteenager because of his sexual orientation.

Mr. President, so far this year the Senate Republican \nleadership has called up one judicial nomination. That is right, \ndespite the fact that other nominations are on the Senate Executive \nCalendar and ready to be confirmed, it is the Republican leadership of \nthe Senate that is delaying action on judicial nominations.\n  When the Senate finally turned to the nomination of Paul Crotty to be \na U.S. district court judge for the Southern District of New York on \nApril 11, that nomination was confirmed 95 to 0. All Democrats present \nvoted in favor of confirmation. Indeed, Senator Schumer and Senator \nClinton came to the floor to speak in favor of the nominee. That is the \nonly judicial nomination Senate Republicans have been willing to \nconsider all year. There has been no filibuster of judicial nominees. \nInstead, it is the Senate Republican leadership that, through its \ndeliberate inaction, is keeping judgeships unnecessarily vacant for \nmonths. With the Crotty nomination, I was the one asking for months for \nthe nomination to be considered, debated, voted on and confirmed.\n  At the time, I noted that another noncontroversial nomination was \nready for Senate action. More than a week ago, I called upon the \nRepublican leadership to proceed to the confirmation of Michael \nSeabright to the District Court of Hawaii. I renew that plea.\n  All Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have been prepared to vote \nfavorably on this nomination for some time. We were prepared to report \nthe nomination last year but it was not listed by the then-chairman on \na committee agenda. I thank Chairman Specter for including Mr. \nSeabright at our meeting on March 17. The nomination was unanimously \nreported and has been on the Senate Executive Calendar for more than a \nmonth. It is Senate Republicans who are resisting a vote on this \njudicial nominee, not Democrats. I understand that Mr. Seabright has \nthe support of both of his home State Senators, both distinguished and \nhighly respected Democratic Senators.\n  Once confirmed, Mr. Seabright will be the 206th of 216 nominees \nbrought before the full Senate for a vote to be confirmed. That means \nthat 830 of the 875 authorized judgeships in the Federal judiciary, or \n95 percent, will be filled. As late as it is in the year, we would \nstill be back on pace with that set by the Republican majority in 1999, \nwhen President Clinton was in the White House. That year, the Senate \nRepublican leadership did not allow the Senate to consider the first \njudicial nominee until April 15. Two judges were confirmed in April and \nthe third was not confirmed until June.\n  Of the 46 judicial vacancies now existing, President Bush has not \neven sent nominees for 28 of those vacancies, more than half. I have \nbeen encouraging the Bush administration to work with Senators to \nidentify qualified and consensus judicial nominees and do so, again, \ntoday. The Democratic leader and I sent the President a letter in this \nregard on April 5, but have received no response.\n  It is now the third week in April, we are more than one-quarter \nthrough the year and so far the President has sent only one new nominee \nfor a Federal court vacancy all year--only one. Instead of sending back \ndivisive nominees, would it not be better for the country, the courts, \nthe American people, the Senate and the administration if the White \nHouse would work with us to identify, and for the President to \nnominate, more consensus nominees like Michael Seabright who can be \nconfirmed quickly with strong, bipartisan votes?\n  I commend the Senators from Hawaii for their efforts to work \ncooperatively to fill judicial vacancies. I only wish Republicans had \ntreated President Clinton's nominees to vacancies in Hawaii with \nsimilar courtesy. Had they, there would not have been the vacancies on \nthe Ninth Circuit and on the district court. The work of the Senators \nfrom Hawaii is indicative of the type of bipartisan efforts Senate \nDemocrats have made with this President and remain willing to make. We \ncan work together to fill judicial vacancies with qualified, consensus \nnominees. The vast majority of the more than 200 judges confirmed \nduring the last 3\\1/2\\ years were confirmed with bipartisan support.\n  The truth is that in President Bush's first term, the 204 judges \nconfirmed were more than were confirmed in either of President \nClinton's two terms, more than during the term of this President's \nfather, and more than in Ronald Reagan's first term when he was being \nassisted by a Republican majority in the Senate. By last December, we \nhad reduced judicial vacancies from the 110 vacancies I inherited in \nthe summer of 2001 to the lowest level, lowest rate and lowest number \nin decades, since Ronald Reagan was in office.\n  The Hawaii judgeship at issue here has been vacant for more than 4 \nyears, since December of 2000 when Judge Alan Kay took senior status. \nPresident Clinton made a nomination to that seat in advance of the \nvacancy, but the Republicans in control of the Senate refused to act on \nit. They preserved the vacancy for a Republican President.\n  In 2002, President Bush nominated James Rohlfing to the vacancy. That \nnomination failed, however, because in the view of his home State \nSenators and the American Bar Association, he was not qualified for the \nposition. It took the White House more than two additional years to \nagree. Finally, in May 2004 that nomination was withdrawn by President \nBush.\n  The administration finally got it right after consultation with the \nHawaii Senators. The President sent Michael Seabright's name to the \nSenate last September. An outstanding attorney who has experience in \nprivate practice as well as a sterling reputation as an assistant U.S. \nattorney, Mr. Seabright merited consideration and swift confirmation. \nDespite his reputation as a law-and-order Republican, Republicans would \nnot move on Mr. Seabright's nomination last Congress. The President \ntook his time renominating Mr. Seabright and even then it took repeated \nrequests to get his nomination included on the agenda of the committee. \nWhen he was considered on March 17 he was reported with unanimous \nsupport. Senate Democrats have long supported and requested action on \nthis nomination.\n\n  I have been urging this President and Senate Republicans for years to \nwork with all Senators and engage in genuine, bipartisan consultation. \nThat process leads to the nomination, confirmation and appointment of \nconsensus nominees with reputations for fairness. The Seabright \nnomination, the bipartisan support of his home State Senators, and the \ncommittee's action by a unaimous, bipartisan vote is a perfect example \nof what I have been urging.\n  I have noted that there are currently 28 judicial vacancies for which \nthe President has delayed sending a nominee. In fact, he has sent the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S4100]]\n\nonly one new judicial nominee all year. I wish he would work with all \nSenators to fill those remaining vacancies rather than through his \ninaction and unnecessarily confrontational approach manufacture \nlongstanding vacancies. It is as if the President and his most partisan \nsupporters want to create a crisis.\n  Over the last weeks we have heard some extremists call for mass \nimpeachments of judges, court-stripping and punishing judges by \nreducing court budgets. Now we are seeing an effort at religious \nMcCarthyism by which Republican partisans inject religion into these \nmatters. Rather than promote crisis and confrontation, I urge this \nPresident to disavow the divisive campaign and do what most others have \nand work with us to identify outstanding consensus nominees. It ill \nserves the country, the courts and most importantly the American people \nfor this administration and the Senate Republican leadership to \ncontinue down the road to conflict.\n  The Seabright nomination shows how unnecessary that conflict really \nis. Let us join together to debate and confirm these consensus nominees \nto these important lifetime posts on the federal judiciary.\n  It is the Federal judiciary that is called upon to rein in the \npolitical branches when their actions contravene the Constitution's \nlimits on governmental authority and restrict individual rights. It is \nthe Federal judiciary that has stood up to the overreaching of this \nadministration in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks.\n  It is more and more the Federal judiciary that is being called upon \nto protect Americans' rights and liberties, our environment and to \nuphold the rule of law as the political branches under the control of \none party have overreached. Federal judges should protect the rights of \nall Americans, not be selected to advance a partisan or personal \nagenda. Once the judiciary is filled with partisans beholden to the \nadministration and willing to reinterpret the Constitution in line with \nthe administration's demands, who will be left to protect American \nvalues and the rights of the American people?\n  The Constitution establishes the Senate as a check and a balance on \nthe choices of a powerful President who might seek to make the Federal \njudiciary an extension of his administration or a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of any political party. Today, Republicans are threatening \nto take away one of the few remaining checks on the power of the \nexecutive branch by their use of what has become known as the nuclear \noption. This assault on our tradition of checks and balances and on the \nprotection of minority rights in the Senate and in our democracy should \nbe abandoned. Eliminating the filibuster by the nuclear option would \ndestroy the Constitution's design of the Senate as an effective check \non the Executive. The elimination of the filibuster would reduce any \nincentive for a President to consult with home State Senators or seek \nthe advice of the Senate on lifetime appointments to the Federal \njudiciary. It is a leap not only toward one-party rule but to an \nunchecked Executive.\n  Rather than blowing up the Senate, let us honor the constitutional \ndesign of our system of checks and balances and work together to fill \njudicial vacancies with consensus nominees. The nuclear option is \nunnecessary. What is needed is a return to consultation and for the \nWhite House to recognize and respect the role of the Senate \nappointments process.\n  The American people have begun to see this threatened partisan power \ngrab for what it is and to realize that the threat and the potential \nharm are aimed at our democracy, at an independent and strong Federal \njudiciary and, ultimately, at their rights and freedoms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4100-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce my support for an \nimportant piece of legislation recently introduced by Senator Dorgan \nand Senator Graham, the Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Act of 2005.\n  This legislation lays out a bold vision for the energy future of our \nNation. It takes steps to secure the research, development, \ndemonstration and market transition necessary to deliver on the \ntremendous promise of a ``hydrogen economy.''\n  The economy of this country today depends heavily on oil, much of \nwhich we must import from countries with hostile and dangerous regimes. \nThis dependence on foreign oil threatens our national security, our \neconomy and the environment. We must take the steps now to find \nalternative sources of energy and new ways of powering everything from \ncell phones to cars. This bill does exactly that.\n  The Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology Act funds the research and \ndemonstration needed to develop key aspects of a reliable, renewable \nhydrogen economy. The bill incorporates language from the Hydrogen \nPassenger Vehicle Act, which I introduced earlier in this Congress to \nprovide funding for projects to demonstrate the cost-effective \nproduction and distribution of hydrogen from renewable sources, such as \nethanol. The bill also adopts several proposals from my Hydrogen and \nFuel Cell Energy Act, including support for hydrogen transportation \ncorridor demonstrations, such as the Upper Midwest Hydrogen Initiative.\n  This legislation will fund development of better fuel cell \ntechnology, of lighter, more efficient ways to store hydrogen on board \nvehicles, and of less expensive ways of converting renewable energy to \nhydrogen fuel.\n  It updates the language and sets clearer priorities for the existing \nhydrogen research program under the Matsunaga Act, and adds important \ndemonstration, commercialization, and market driver mechanisms, using \nFederal Government procurement to help drive demand for new technology.\n  In order to be most effective, however, we will need to enact the tax \nincentives necessary to encourage widespread investment, production and \nutilization of hydrogen. Tax credits for fuel cell vehicles, for \nhydrogen fueling infrastructure, for hydrogen fuel from renewable \nsources, and for stationary and portable fuel cells should all be \nconsidered as part of a package of support for the hydrogen economy.\n  The measures proposed in this legislation will require a significant \nFederal investment in our energy future, but with these measures, we \ncan use hydrogen and fuel cell technologies to realize our vision of \ncars that do not pollute, of power that will not go out, and of true \nenergy security. I urge the support of my colleagues for this visionary \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Harkin has shown great leadership \nin the effort to create a hydrogen fuel-cell economy and I welcome his \nsupport and look forward to working with him and other cosponsors as we \nmove this legislation forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4100-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4100-S4101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I, along with the Armenians in Rhode Island \nand throughout the United States, as well as those around the world, \nrecognize the 90th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  On the night of April 24, 1915, nationalists in the Ottoman Empire \nrounded up and executed 200 Armenian community leaders, sparking an 8-\nyear campaign of tyranny that impacted the lives of every Armenian in \nAsia Minor. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million Armenians were murdered, \nand another 500,000 were exiled.\n  The U.S. Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morganthau, Sr., \nunsuccessfully pleaded with President Wilson to act. Morganthau later \nremembered the events of the genocide. ``I am confident that the whole \nhistory of the human race contains no such horrible episode as this,'' \nthe Ambassador wrote in his memoir. ``The great massacres and \npersecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the \nsufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.''\n  Unfortunately, the United States, and the world, did not intervene.\n  Today, on the 90th Anniversary, I am proud to be one of 32 Senators \nwho urged President Bush to refer to the mass murder of Armenians as \ngenocide in his commemorative statement. Failing to do so, does not \nproperly commemorate this tragedy. Accurate acknowledgment of this \nevent in human history is a small, but necessary, step to take.\n\n[[Page S4101]]\n\n  Today, dozens of Armenian soldiers are deployed to Iraq, carrying out \nhumanitarian operations in Karbala and al-Hilla, working as truck \ndrivers, bomb detonators, and doctors. Armenian soldiers are also \nserving in Kosovo, performing peace support operations. I believe their \nresponse of helping others in need is part of the healing process. \nThese Armenians did not allow others to be left as helpless as they \nwere generations ago.\n  As a Nation, we must respond to acts of oppression to ensure that \nvictims of hatred and prejudice did not perish in vain. We must stand \nas witnesses to protect people from persecution for the simple reason \nthey are different. Thus, we must be committed to properly remembering \nthe Armenian Genocide.\n  Menk panav chenk mornar.

I am proud \nthat I have the opportunity to reemphasize their contribution here \ntoday, in particular, since the Air Guard has recently made us very \nproud in Montana.\n  Under the leadership of Colonel Mark Meyer, our 120th Fighter Wing \nhas been honored with three national awards for 2004--the Air Force \nOutstanding Unit Award, the Outstanding Security Forces Squadron of the \nYear Award, and the Maintenance Group Effectiveness Award.\n  The Air Force Outstanding Unit Award recognizes the exemplary \nachievements of the entire 120th Fighter Wing. On short notice the Wing \ndeployed more than 200 airmen to the 332nd Air Expeditionary Wing at \nBalad Air Base, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and at \nhome they activated 185 people to fight Montana's second largest \nwildfire season on record.\n  The Air Force also bestowed an award on the Wing's Security Forces \nsquadron, under the direction of Squadron Commander Major Donald \nMahoney. They were honored with the Air National Guard Security Forces \nUnit Award.\n  Among their standout achievements was the logistical support they \nprovided to the South Dakota Air National Guard Security Forces while \ntheir members conducted field training exercises at Fort Harrison in \nHelena. And, once again, our guardsmen operated on short notice.\n  Their Combat Arms Specialists performed weapons qualifications for \nover 300 personnel in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. They \ncompleted these tasks while protecting the Northern border between \nMontana and Canada and collaborating with Montana's local, civil, and \nmilitary emergency services agencies.\n  Under the leadership of Maintenance Commander Lieutenant Colonel \nKendall Switzer, the members of the 120th Fighter Wing Maintenance \nGroup earned the Air National Guard's Maintenance Effectiveness Award \nfor their extraordinary aircraft maintenance.\n  Their hard work and expertise supported three important missions: \nOperation Iraqi Freedom, the Alert Detachment at March Air Reserve base \nin California, and the Combat Air Patrol Missions of Operation Nobel \nEagle.\n  I offer a tremendous ``Well Done'' to the Air National Guard.

Mr. President, not many people can lay claim to a day, \nbut Gaylord Nelson can. On April 22, 1970, Gaylord Nelson created a day \nto celebrate the glory of the Earth. Nelson biographer Bill \nChristofferson asks ``Where did Nelson get his lifelong interest and \ndedication to the environment? By osmosis, [Nelson] would say, while \ngrowing up in Clear Lake Wisconsin.''\n  It's true that Wisconsin has a tradition of great conservationists, \nAldo Leopold, author of Sand County Almanac; Sigurd Olson, one of the \nfounders of the Wilderness Society; and John Muir, founder of the \nSierra Club. But because of Gaylord Nelson, Wisconsin can lay claim to \nthe genesis of Earth Day, a day of national and international \nremembrance of the importance of our natural resources and a clean \nenvironment.\n  While these great leaders are well known for their conservation \nvision, Wisconsinites across the State do their part every day to make \nthat vision a reality. From the backyards and parks of our cities and \nsuburbs to our forests and farms, we take our stewardship of the land \nseriously. For example, our farmers continue to work with the support \nof Federal, State and local partnerships to prevent pollution, improve \nwildlife habitat, and protect wetlands and open spaces, investing \nmillions of dollars in hundred of thousands of acres each year, all \nwhile ensuring the land is healthy enough to produce food and raw \nmaterials for generations to come.\n  I know that the people of Wisconsin, living in such a beautiful and \necologically diverse State, feel a special connection to our natural \nresources and share a long tradition of our State government achieving \nexcellence in its conservation policies. Conservation is part of our \nculture in Wisconsin, and the people in Wisconsin are very \nenvironmentally savvy. Every year I hold a town hall meeting in each \none of Wisconsin's 72 counties, and protecting the environment is a top \nissue.\n  I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr. Nelson. He is a \nformer member of this body, and I am privileged to hold his Senate \nseat. He is a distinguished former Governor of the State of Wisconsin, \na recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a personal hero \nof mine. I salute Gaylord Nelson for changing the consciousness of a \nNation. He is the living embodiment of the principle that one person \ncan truly change the world.\n  During his 18 years of service in the Senate, Gaylord Nelson brought \nabout significant change for the ``greener'' in both our Nation's law \nand the institution of the Senate itself. He is the co-author of the \nEnvironmental Education Act, which he sponsored with the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, \nand he sponsored the amendment to give the St. Croix and the Namekagon \nRivers scenic protection. In the wake of Rachel Carson's book Silent \nSpring, Gaylord Nelson, along with Senator Philip Hart of Michigan, \ndirected national attention to the documented persistent \nbioaccumulative effects of organochlorine pesticides used in the Great \nLakes by authoring the ban on DDT in 1972. He was the primary sponsor \nof the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore Act, protecting one of \nnorthern Wisconsin's most beautiful areas.\n  And Senator Nelson, of course, was the founder of Earth Day. Thanks \nto him, here we are 35 years later taking time out of our lives to \nthink about conservation. An astonishing 20 million Americans, 10 \npercent of the U.S. population, participated in the first observance of \nEarth Day on April 22, 1970. American Heritage magazine described the \nevent as ``one of the most remarkable happenings in the history of \ndemocracy.'' The day was marked by marches, rallies, teach-ins, and \nconcerts. Fifth Avenue was closed for 2 hours and over 100,000 people \ncelebrated Earth Day on Union Square in New York City.\n  Earth Day is an event that in addition to changing the environmental \nconsciousness of the country literally stopped the Senate. Members of \nboth bodies voted to adjourn their respective Houses in the middle of \nthe legislative week to attend Earth Day events, an adjournment that \nwould be extremely rare today. Twenty-two Senators participated by \ngiving Earth Day speeches across the country. The National Education \nAssociation, NEA, estimated that 10 million school children celebrated \nin the first Earth Day. The States of New Jersey and New York created \nState environmental agencies that week.\n  Earth Day has become an important part of who we are. From Milwaukee,\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\nWI, to Mumbai, India, millions of people across the world are taking \nSenator Nelson's legacy to heart. They are volunteering tomorrow and \nthis weekend to conserve the environment whether it is in their \nbackyard, local river, or park.\n  I hope that on this Earth Day 2005, the Congress will re-dedicate \nitself to achieving the bipartisan consensus on protecting the \nenvironment that existed for nearly 2 decades. The Clean Water Act, for \nexample, passed the Senate in 1971 by a vote of 86-0. When President \nNixon vetoed it, the Senate overrode his veto, 52-12. The Endangered \nSpecies Act, which is under such attack right now, was passed by the \nSenate on a 92-0 vote in 1973.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years we have faced numerous proposals to \nroll back the environmental and health and safety protections upon \nwhich Americans depend. From clean water to clean air, the list of \nenvironmental rollbacks is stunning and disturbing. We need to work \ntogether to protect the environment, not revert to the times when we \nsaw the Cuyahoga River catch fire, when at least one of the Great Lakes \nwas considered ``ecologically dead,'' and when dumping of toxic wastes \ninto rivers was standard operating procedure.\n  Gaylord Nelson stated on the 30th Anniversary of Earth Day:\n\n       We have finally come to understand that the real wealth of \n     a nation is its air, water, soil, forests, rivers, lakes, \n     oceans, scenic beauty, wildlife habitats, and biodiversity. \n     Take this resource away, and all that is left is a wasteland. \n     That's the whole economy. That is where the economic activity \n     and all the jobs come from. These biological systems contain \n     the sustaining wealth of the world.\n       As we continue to degrade them, we are consuming our \n     capital. And in the process, we erode our living standards \n     and compromise the quality of our habitat. We are veering \n     down a dangerous path. We are not just toying with nature; we \n     are compromising the capacity of natural systems to do what \n     they need to do to preserve a livable world.\n\n  Last night, Senator Nelson issued a statement to mark the 35th \nanniversary of Earth Day and calling Earth Day 2005 ``a wake up call.'' \nSenator Nelson said:\n\n       On environmental issues, our intelligence is reliable. Our \n     scientists have the facts, if we will only listen. It is a \n     ``slam dunk'' that we cannot continue on our present course. \n     But without Presidential and Congressional leadership, even \n     an enlightened public cannot cope with the greatest challenge \n     of our time.\n\n  I agree with this assessment, and I ask unanimous consent that the \nfull text of Senator Nelson's 35th anniversary of Earth Day statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Earth Day Anniversary 2005--A Wake Up Call\n\n       The 35th anniversary of Earth Day is a sobering occasion. \n     On previous anniversaries we have hailed this ``new \n     awakening'' as millions around the world suddenly rose up and \n     pledged their support for a new campaign to save the natural \n     environment.\n       In 1993 American Heritage magazine called Earth Day ``one \n     of the most remarkable happenings in the history of \n     democracy.'' There has been progress, of course, particularly \n     in public awareness of the critical role environment plays in \n     our lives and in the education and training of new \n     environmental leaders. Environment has become a major \n     political issue. The public is prepared to support those \n     measures necessary to forge a sustainable society, if the \n     President and the Congress have the vision to lead us to that \n     goal.\n       Unfortunately, the President and the Congress have not \n     stepped up to the challenge of providing national and world \n     leadership on the environmental crisis.\n       In fact, on some key issues, they are actually resisting or \n     reversing progress made in the past 30 to 40 years. And \n     without strong, sustained leadership from the President and \n     Congress, the urgent challenge to protect the environment and \n     create a sustainable society cannot succeed. Theodore \n     Roosevelt made conservation a top priority for the Republican \n     party, and many members of his party carried that torch over \n     the years. Recently, however, the GOP leadership has \n     abandoned this cause.\n       There are many serious environmental problems confronting \n     us. But two current environmental issues dramatize this \n     failure of leadership--energy conservation, and population \n     control. Both are critical to the sustainability of our \n     society. In each case, there is not only a lack of wise \n     national leadership but an apparent determination to turn \n     back the clock. The surrender to special interests on these \n     two issues makes a mockery of any claim to environmental \n     awareness.\n       Egged on by the President, the Senate on March 16 sneaked \n     into the annual budget resolution a scheme to allow drilling \n     for oil in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \n     protected in 1960 at the urging of great environmentalists \n     such as Sigurd Olson, Justice William O. Douglas, and \n     Wilderness Act author Howard Zahniser. The bill was signed by \n     President Eisenhower.\n       This is not just a sabotage of environmental policy. It \n     also undermines any hope for a wise energy policy. When all \n     the evidence calls for bold steps to conserve energy and \n     develop alternative sources, this cynical action implies that \n     we can burn all the oil we want and just move on to the next \n     untapped source, no matter where it might be.\n       We are told it may be 10 years before a very modest amount \n     of oil could be produced from this pristine refuge. And what \n     would it cost in real terms?\n       For the President to call for oil drilling in the Arctic \n     Wildlife Refuge is like burning the furniture in the White \n     House to keep the First Family comfortable.\n       Equally critical is the failure of the President and \n     Congress to confront the issue of population control, in our \n     own rapidly growing country and the rest of the world.\n       A ``Rockefeller Report'' in 1972, issued by the President's \n     commission on population growth, urged the U.S. to move \n     vigorously to stabilize our population at about 200 million \n     as rapidly as possible. Since then our population has \n     ballooned to 282 million, and is expected to reach 500 \n     million between 2060 and 2070. We are heading into a century \n     in which we will double and triple our population in a short \n     time.\n       Worldwide population projections are equally chilling. A \n     series of international conferences have called for bold \n     action to control population growth.\n       Yet the United States in recent years has become an \n     aggressive opponent of family planning programs in other \n     countries, and we are now facing efforts by some ``new \n     conservatives'' to impose similar restrictions at home.\n       On previous Earth Days we have offered a solution: The \n     President should set the standard by delivering a message to \n     the Congress on the state of the environment, citing \n     priorities that need to be addressed. Congress then should \n     hold hearings on these issues. This would produce a \n     ``national dialogue'' on the sustainability of our \n     environment, and provide a roadmap to the future.\n       Without Presidential leadership and Congressional hearings, \n     we cannot claim to be taking seriously the most compelling \n     threats facing our society.\n       On environmental issues, our intelligence is reliable. Our \n     scientists have the facts, if we will only listen. It is a \n     ``slam dunk'' that we cannot continue on our present course. \n     But without Presidential and Congressional leadership, even \n     an enlightened public cannot cope with the greatest challenge \n     of our time.--Gaylord Nelson, Washington, DC, April, 2005.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I hope that Wisconsinites and citizens across America \ntake Senator Nelson's words to heart. I hope that they use this Earth \nDay to collect their thoughts and voice their opinions about the need \nto protect the environment and need for Congressional leadership on \nthis issue.\n  Wisconsinites value a clean environment, not just for purely \naesthetic or philosophical purposes, but because a clean environment \nensures that Wisconsin and the United States as a whole remains a good \nplace to raise a family, start a business, and buy a home. We \nunderstand that by protecting our environment we are protecting our \neconomy. And, it is important on this Earth Day 2005 that we continue \nto fight for strong environmental laws, and we press for strong \nenvironmental leadership in Congress. Let's continue to move forward, \nnot roll back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4102-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4102-S4104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TAXPAYER PROTECTION AND ASSISTANCE ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on Monday, April 18, 2005, I introduced \nS. 832, the Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act of 2005.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record explanatory \nlanguage to accompany that legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Analysis of Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act\n\n\n                    (1) low-income taxpayer clinics\n\n       Present Law. The Internal Revenue Code (the ``Code'') \n     provides that the Secretary is authorized to provide up to $6 \n     million per year in matching grants to certain low-income \n     taxpayer clinics. Eligible clinics are those that charge no \n     more than a nominal fee to either represent low-income \n     taxpayers in controversies with the IRS or provide tax \n     information to individuals for whom English is a second \n     language (``controversy clinics''). No clinic can receive \n     more than $100,000 per year.\n       A ``clinic'' includes (1) a clinical program at an \n     accredited law, business, or accounting\n\n[[Page S4103]]\n\n     school, in which students represent low-income taxpayers, or \n     (2) an organization exempt from tax under Code section 501(c) \n     which either represents low-income taxpayers or provides \n     referral to qualified representatives.\n       Explanation of Provision. The provision authorizes $10 \n     million in matching grants for low-income taxpayer return \n     preparation clinics (``preparation clinics''). These clinics \n     may provide tax return preparation and filing services to \n     low-income taxpayers, including those for whom English is a \n     second language. The authorization of $6 million for low-\n     income controversy clinics under present law is also \n     increased to $10 million.\n       The provision expands the scope of clinics eligible to \n     receive preparation clinic grants to encompass clinics at all \n     educational institutions. The provision prohibits the use of \n     grants for overhead expenses at both controversy clinics and \n     preparation clinics. The provision also authorizes the IRS to \n     use mass communications, referrals, and other means to \n     promote the benefits and encourage the use of low-income \n     controversy and preparation clinics.\n       Effective Date. The provision is effective for grants made \n     after the date of enactment.\n\n\n                          (2) enrolled agents\n\n       Present Law. The Secretary is authorized to regulate the \n     practice of representatives of persons before the Department \n     of the Treasury. Circular No. 230, promulgated by the \n     Secretary, provides rules relating to practice before the \n     Department of the Treasury by attorneys, certified public \n     accountants, enrolled agents, enrolled actuaries, and others.\n       Explanation of Provision. The provision adds a new section \n     to the Code permitting the Secretary to prescribe regulations \n     to regulate the conduct of enrolled agents in regard to their \n     practice before the IRS and to permit enrolled agents meeting \n     the Secretary's qualifications to use the credentials or \n     designation ``enrolled agent'', ``EA'', or ``E.A.''.\n       Effective Date. The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n    (3) regulation of practice before the department of the treasury\n\n       Present Law. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to \n     regulate the practice of representatives of persons before \n     the Department of the Treasury. The Secretary is also \n     authorized to suspend or disbar from practice before the \n     Department a representative who is incompetent, who is \n     disreputable, who violates the rules regulating practice \n     before the Department, or who (with intent to defraud) \n     willfully and knowingly misleads or threatens the person \n     being represented (or a person who may be represented). The \n     rules promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to this provision \n     are contained in Circular 230. Although permitted by statute, \n     the preparation and filing of tax returns and other \n     submissions (absent further involvement) has not been \n     considered within the scope of these Circular 230 provisions.\n       Reasons for Change. In her 2003 annual report to the \n     Congress, the National Taxpayer Advocate noted that over 55 \n     percent of the 130 million U.S. individual taxpayers paid a \n     return preparer to prepare their 2001 Federal income tax \n     returns and that of the 1.2 million known tax return \n     preparers, one-quarter to one-half are not regulated by any \n     licensing entity or subject to minimum competency \n     requirements. Fifty-seven percent of the earned income credit \n     overclaims were attributable to returns prepared by paid \n     preparers.\n       Tax practitioners play an important role in the tax system. \n     While certain individuals authorized to practice before the \n     IRS are already subject to oversight, many are not. For those \n     taxpayers who use a paid tax practitioner, compliance with \n     the tax laws hinges on the practitioners competence and \n     ethical standards. The IRS's lack of oversight over such \n     practitioners therefore contributes to noncompliance. \n     Further, improving the accuracy of tax returns at the front-\n     end of the process, should reduce government burden and \n     intrusion on taxpayers through enforcement.\n       Requiring regulation of individuals preparing Federal \n     income tax returns and other documents for submission to the \n     IRS will improve the fairness and administration of the tax \n     system. Testing, education, ethical training, and effective \n     oversight of enrolled preparers are critical elements to \n     improving tax compliance.\n       Description of Proposal. The proposal expands the \n     Secretary's authority to regulate representatives practicing \n     before the Treasury to include individuals preparing for \n     compensation Federal income tax returns and other submissions \n     to the IRS (``enrolled preparers''). The types of \n     practitioners authorized to practice before the IRS that are \n     subject to oversight under regulations in effect on the date \n     of enactment of the proposal are excluded from the \n     regulations establishing eligibility requirements for \n     compensated preparers (i.e., Enrolled Agents, Certified \n     Public Accountants, and attorneys).\n       The Secretary of the Treasury is required to issue \n     regulations no later than one year after the date of \n     enactment establishing eligibility requirements for enrolled \n     preparers to practice before the Treasury. Such regulations \n     will require the initial registration of enrolled preparers, \n     as well as a process for regularly renewing the initial \n     registration. Enrolled preparers renewing their registration \n     shall be required to establish completion of continuing \n     education requirements in a manner set forth by the Treasury \n     in regulations. The Secretary is expected to minimize the \n     burden and cost on those subject to the registration \n     requirement to the extent feasible. Thus, the Secretary is \n     authorized to define the scope of the registration \n     requirement in a manner that accomplishes this goal.\n       The proposal requires the Secretary to develop and \n     administer an examination to establish the competency of \n     enrolled preparers. The examination for the enrolled \n     preparers should test the applicant's technical knowledge to \n     prepare Federal tax returns and knowledge of ethical \n     standards. Moreover, the examination shall be designed to \n     include testing on technical issues with high rates of \n     erroneous reporting, such as claims for the earned income \n     credit. The Secretary is authorized to contract for both \n     the development and administration of any examination. The \n     contract authority includes allowing the Secretary to \n     establish the parameters that the examination must meet \n     and authorize the use of an examination that is not, \n     however, developed or administered by the IRS. Further, \n     efficiencies will be gained by coordinating the \n     examination requirement with the enrolled agent exam (the \n     Special Enrollment Examination (SEE)).\n       To enhance the regulation of practice before Treasury, the \n     proposal establishes the Office of Professional \n     Responsibility within the IRS under the supervision and \n     direction of the Director, an official reporting directly to \n     the Commissioner, IRS. The Director, Office of Professional \n     Responsibility will be entitled to compensation at the same \n     rate as the highest rate of basic pay established for the \n     Senior Executive Service, or, if higher, at a rate fixed \n     under the critical pay authority established under section \n     9503 of title 5. The proposal also authorizes the Secretary \n     to appoint administrative law judges to conduct hearing of \n     sanctions imposed on representatives practicing before the \n     Treasury and allows transparent proceedings involving \n     practitioners to provide accountability for both the \n     practitioners and the discipline authority (i.e., the IRS).\n       The Secretary may impose fees for the registration and \n     renewal of enrolled preparers. The proposal provides that the \n     fees paid for registration and renewal shall be available to \n     the Office of Professional Responsibility for the purpose of \n     reimbursing the costs of administering and enforcing rules \n     promulgated by the Secretary regulating practice before the \n     Treasury.\n       The proposal also provides that the Secretary shall conduct \n     a public awareness campaign to encourage taxpayers to use \n     only those professionals who establish their competency under \n     the regulations promulgated under section 330 of title 31. \n     The public awareness campaign shall be conducted in a manner \n     to inform the public of the registration requirements imposed \n     on enrolled preparers and the general requirement that \n     preparers must sign the return and provide their registration \n     number on the return.\n       The proposal increases the penalties on tax return \n     preparers who fail to sign a return or fail to provide an \n     identifying number on a return from $50 to $500 per return. \n     In addition, amounts collected from the imposition of \n     penalties under section 6694 and 6695 or under the \n     regulations promulgated under section 330 of title 31 shall \n     be directed to the Office of Professional Responsibility for \n     the administration of the public awareness campaign. The \n     proposal also permits the Secretary to use any funds \n     specifically appropriated for earned income credit compliance \n     to improve compliance with the rules regulating practice \n     before the Treasury.\n       Effective date. The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n        (4) Regulation of Refund Anticipation Loan Facilitators\n\n       Present Law. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to \n     regulate the practice of representatives of persons before \n     the Department of the Treasury. The rules promulgated by the \n     Secretary pursuant to this provision are contained in \n     Circular 230. In general, the preparation and filing of tax \n     returns (absent further involvement) has not been considered \n     within the scope of these Circular 230 provisions.\n       The tax code also imposes penalties on persons who fail to \n     follow various tax code requirements in the process of \n     preparing and filing tax returns on behalf of taxpayers. \n     Present law does not contain any provision regulating the \n     conduct of persons who provide refund anticipation loans to \n     individual taxpayers in connection with the filing of tax \n     returns.\n       Reasons for Change. There is concern with the use of tax \n     refunds and the IRS's direct deposit indicator \n     acknowledgement as a means for selling refund anticipation \n     loans to taxpayers, particularly low-income taxpayers. \n     Requiring regulation of refund anticipation loan facilitators \n     will increase the ability of the IRS to hold such \n     facilitators accountable. Increasing the information that \n     must be disclosed, both orally and in writing, to the \n     taxpayer in connection with a refund anticipation loan will \n     heighten taxpayer awareness of the true costs and \n     consequences of a refund anticipation loan.\n       Description of Proposal. The proposal requires the annual \n     registration of refund loan facilitators with the Secretary \n     of the Department of the Treasury. A refund loan facilitator \n     is any person who originates the electronic submission of \n     income tax returns for another person and, in connection with \n     the electronic submission, solicits, processes, or otherwise \n     facilitates the making of\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\n     a refund anticipation loan to the individual taxpayer on \n     whose behalf the tax return is submitted. It is intended that \n     the Secretary, in promulgating regulations under this \n     proposal, will require refund loan facilitators to submit an \n     annual application that includes the name, address, and TIN \n     of the applicant and a schedule of the applicant's fees for \n     such year.\n       The proposal requires refund loan facilitators to disclose \n     to taxpayers, both orally and in writing, that they may file \n     an electronic tax return without applying for a refund \n     anticipation loan and the cost of filing such an electronic \n     return compared to the cost of the refund anticipation loan. \n     In addition, the proposal requires refund loan facilitators \n     to disclose to taxpayers all fees and interest charges \n     associated with a refund anticipation loan and provide a \n     comparison with fees and interest charges associated with \n     other types of consumer credit, as well as fees and interest \n     charges for similar refund anticipation loans. Refund loan \n     facilitators also must disclose to taxpayers the expected \n     time within which tax refunds are typically paid based on \n     different filing options, the risk that the full amount of \n     the refund may not be paid or received within the expected \n     time, and additional costs the taxpayer may incur in \n     connection with the refund anticipation loan if the tax \n     refund is delayed or not paid.\n       In addition to the above disclosure requirements, refund \n     loan facilitators must disclose to taxpayers whether the \n     refund anticipation loan agreement includes a debt collection \n     offset arrangement. Debt collection offsets are arrangements \n     between refund loan facilitators and a taxpayer's creditor to \n     offset the taxpayer's expected refund against an outstanding \n     liability owed to the creditor. There is concern with the \n     potential abuse of individual taxpayers through the use of \n     such arrangements by refund loan facilitators. To discourage \n     their use, refund loan facilitators must fully disclose to \n     taxpayers any arrangements to offset a taxpayer's expected \n     refund against an outstanding liability. The Secretary is \n     authorized to require refund loan facilitators to disclose \n     any other information deemed necessary. The provision does \n     not preempt state laws or political subdivision thereof.\n       The proposal permits the Secretary to impose monetary \n     penalties on refund loan facilitators who fail to meet the \n     registration or disclosure requirements, unless such failure \n     was due to reasonable cause. The penalty for failure to \n     register is not to exceed the gross income derived from all \n     refund anticipation loans during the period the refund loan \n     facilitator was not registered. The penalty for failure to \n     disclose the information required by the proposal is not to \n     exceed the gross income derived from all refund anticipation \n     loans with respect to which the refund loan facilitator \n     failed to provide the required disclosure information. The \n     proposal also permits the Secretary to disclose the name of \n     or penalty imposed upon any refund loan facilitator who \n     fails to meet the registration or disclosure requirements.\n       The proposal provides that the Secretary shall conduct a \n     public awareness campaign to educate the public on the costs \n     associated with refund anticipation loans, including the \n     costs as compared to other forms of credit. The public \n     awareness campaign shall be conducted in a manner that \n     educates the public on making sound financial decisions with \n     respect to refund anticipation loans. Amounts collected from \n     the imposition of penalties on refund loan facilitators shall \n     be directed to the IRS for the administration of the public \n     awareness campaign.\n       Effective date. The proposal is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n             (5) Taxpayer Access to Financial Institutions\n\n       Present Law. A large number of individual taxpayers do not \n     have bank accounts. Because of this, these taxpayers are \n     unable to participate fully in electronic filing, because IRS \n     cannot electronically transmit to them their tax refunds.\n       Reasons for Change. Effectiveness of tax incentives and \n     assistance programs are diminished when individuals do not \n     have an account at a financial institution. For example, the \n     benefits received through the Earned Income Tax Credit \n     incentive diminishes when taxpayers redirect their tax refund \n     in exchange for a refund anticipation loan. In contrast, if \n     such taxpayers had an account at an insured financial \n     institution, such tax refund could be directly deposited into \n     the taxpayer's account without a reduction for fees paid to a \n     refund anticipation loan facilitator.\n       Between 25 and 56 million adults are do not have an account \n     with an insured financial institution. These individuals rely \n     on alternative financial service providers to cash checks, \n     pay bills, send remittances, and obtain credit. Many of these \n     individuals are low- and moderate-income families. Promoting \n     the establishment of accounts with an insured financial \n     institution will allow the taxpayer to keep more of his or \n     her tax refund and encourage savings.\n       Description of Proposal. The proposal authorizes the \n     Secretary of the Department of the Treasury to award \n     demonstration project grants (totaling up to $10 million) to \n     eligible entities to provide tax preparation assistance in \n     connection with establishing an account in a federally \n     insured depository institution for individuals that do not \n     have such an account. Entities eligible to receive grants \n     are: tax-exempt organizations described in section 501(c)(3), \n     federally insured depository institutions, State or local \n     governmental agencies, community development financial \n     institutions, Indian tribal organizations, Alaska native \n     corporations, native Hawaiian organizations, and labor \n     organizations.\n       The provision requires the Secretary, in consultation with \n     the National Taxpayer Advocate, to study the delivery of tax \n     refunds through debit cards or other electronic means, in \n     addition to those methods presently available. The purpose of \n     the study is to assist those individuals who do not have \n     access to financial accounts or institutions to obtain access \n     to their tax refunds. The Secretary shall submit a report to \n     Congress with the results of the study not later than one \n     year after the date of enactment.\n       Effective Date. The proposal is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                      (6) Use of Practitioner Fees\n\n       Present Law. The Tax Court is authorized to impose on \n     practitioners admitted to practice before the Tax Court a fee \n     of up to $30 per year. These fees are to be used to employ \n     independent counsel to pursue disciplinary matters.\n       Explanation of Provision. The provision provides that Tax \n     Court fees imposed on practitioners also are available to \n     provide services to pro se taxpayers who may not be familiar \n     with Tax Court procedures and applicable legal requirements. \n     Fees may be used for education programs for pro se taxpayers.\n       Effective Date. The provision is effective on the date of \n     enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4104-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       TRIBUTE TO FIRST MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH OF LITTLE ROCK\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the \noldest houses of worship in Arkansas. This month the First Missionary \nBaptist Church of Little Rock, AR, will celebrate its 160th \nanniversary.\n  The First Missionary Baptist Church was founded in 1845 by Wilson \nBrown, a slave, who felt led by God to establish a house of worship. In \norder to fully understand this remarkable achievement we must look at \nthe era in which this church was founded.\n  First Missionary Baptist Church was established 15 years before the \nCivil War began and 18 years before the Emancipation Proclamation. Men \nand women of African descent during those times were viewed as property \nand had no legal rights. It certainly took courage and vision to \nestablish a church under such circumstances.\n  Over the years, the First Missionary Baptist Church family has been a \nwitness to history. Many important figures of the civil rights movement \nhave stood in First Missionary's pulpit to deliver stirring messages.\n  Reverend Roland Smith, the church's fifth pastor, was active in the \ncivil rights movement and invited powerful leaders such as Dr. Benjamin \nElijah Mays and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to speak from the pulpit. \nDr. King spoke in April 1963, just 4 months before the ``March on \nWashington'', and his famous ``I have a dream'' speech. The podium and \nbible he used that day are still on display in the vestibule of the \nchurch sanctuary.\n  In 1991, the church hosted another great leader, the Governor of \nArkansas Bill Clinton. A few short months later Gov. Clinton launched \nhis bid to become President of the United States. I guess you might say \nthat the pulpit at First Missionary Baptist Church is a launching pad \nto greatness.\n  Although First Missionary Baptist Church has great historical \nsignificance, its spiritual significance is most important. For 160 \nyears, this church has been a beacon of hope and a spiritual oasis to \nthousands of Arkansans. This church has worked hard to fulfill the \ncalling of Christ spoken of in the 4th chapter of Luke--to preach the \ngospel to the poor; to heal the brokenhearted; to preach deliverance to \nthe captives; and recovering of sight to the blind; to set at liberty \nthem that are bruised, to preach the acceptable year of the Lord. In \nthe end, that is First Missionary Baptist Church's greatest \nlegacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4104-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4104-S4105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ONCOLOGY NURSING SOCIETY\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \noncology nurses. May 1 marks the beginning of the 10th annual Oncology \nNursing Day and Month and this year marks the\n\n[[Page S4105]]\n\n30th Anniversary of the Oncology Nursing Society.\n  As co-chair of the Senate Cancer Coalition, I would like to recognize \nthat oncology nurses play an important and essential role in providing \nquality, comprehensive cancer care. These nurses are principally \ninvolved in the administration and monitoring of chemotherapy and the \nassociated side-effects patients experience. As anyone ever treated for \ncancer--or who has a loved one who has been treated--will tell you, \noncology nurses provide quality clinical, psychosocial and supportive \ncare to patients and their families. In short, they are integral to our \nNation's cancer care delivery system.\n  The Oncology Nursing Society is the largest organization of oncology \nhealth professionals in the world, with more than 31,000 registered \nnurses and other health care professionals. Since 1975, the Oncology \nNursing Society has been dedicated to excellence in patient care, \nteaching, research, administration and education in the field of \noncology. The Society's mission is to promote excellence in oncology \nnursing and quality cancer care.\n  The Oncology Nursing Society has 19 chapters in my home State of \nCalifornia, which support our oncology nurses in their ongoing efforts \nto provide outstanding quality cancer care to patients and their \nfamilies throughout our State.\n  Cancer is a complex, multifaceted and chronic disease. Each year in \nthe United States, approximately 1.37 million people are diagnosed with \ncancer, another 570,000 lose their battles with this terrible disease, \nand more than 8 million Americans count themselves among a growing \ncommunity known as cancer survivors.\n  In 2005, the American Cancer Society estimates that in the State of \nCalifornia there will be 135,030 new cancer diagnoses, and 56,090 \ncancer deaths. At the same time, in 2005, the Health Resources and \nServices Administration, HRSA, estimates that in the State of \nCalifornia there will be a shortage of 18,409 nurses or a ten percent \nunmet need for nurses overall.\n  We must do more as a Nation to prevent and reduce suffering from \ncancer and to support the oncology nursing workforce.\n  Every day, oncology nurses see the pain and suffering caused by \ncancer and understand the physical, emotional, and financial challenges \nthat people with cancer face throughout their diagnosis and treatment.\n  Over the last ten years, the setting where treatment for cancer is \nprovided has changed dramatically. An estimated 80 percent of all \ncancer patients receive care in community settings, including cancer \ncenters, physicians' offices, and hospital outpatient departments. \nOncology nurses are involved in the care of a cancer patient from the \nbeginning through the end of treatment, and they are the front-line \nproviders of care by administering chemotherapy, managing patient \ntherapies and side-effects, and providing counseling to patients and \nfamily members.\n  I thank all of our Nation's oncology nurses for their dedication to \nour Nation's cancer patients, especially those who care for cancer \npatients in California. I commend the Oncology Nursing Society for all \nof its efforts and leadership over the last 30 years and congratulate \nits leaders and members on its 30th Anniversary. The Oncology Nursing \nSociety has contributed immensely to the quality and accessibility of \ncare for all cancer patients and their families, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Society and oncology nurses in their \nimportant endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4105-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN ED WILLOUGHBY\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngood friend who recently retired after three decades on the radio. John \nEd Willoughby, who has been a familiar voice on WAPI-AM 1070s morning \ntalk-radio show, ``The Breakfast Club,'' signed off on April 15, 2005. \nJohn Ed's last day on the air was the 30th anniversary of his first day \non the air: April 15, 1975. Over the years, I had many opportunities to \njoin John Ed on the air, and I always appreciated his candid, honest, \nand humorous demeanor.\n  John Ed was born February 3, 1935, in Birmingham, AL. He attended \nWest End High School, where he excelled on the athletic field as \nquarterback of the football team, and captain of the baseball and \nbasketball teams.\n  He attended the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, which is where \nour friendship began. We met as students at the University of Alabama, \nand it was there that we both served as members of the Delta Chi \nfraternity.\n  His radio career began in 1975 on WSGN radio with cohost Tommy \nCharles. The duo was an instant success and became Birmingham's top \nrated radio morning show for 8\\1/2\\ years. John Ed and Tommy then moved \nto WVOK-AM/WQUS-FM for a short time before going to WERC radio in 1985. \nThey were a talk radio force to be reckoned with, remaining No. 1 in \nBirmingham, until Tommy's passing in 1996. Following Tommy's death, \nDoug Layton joined John Ed and they stayed on the air until February of \n1998. In June of 1998, John Ed joined his son, J Willoughby and Scott \nMichaels for a morning show devoted to talk radio on WAPI-AM called \n``The Breakfast Club.'' He would finish out his career at WAPI.\n  I have had the pleasure of being interviewed by John Ed numerous \ntimes over the years. Whether it was in-studio in Birmingham, in \nWashington during one of his visits, or over the phone, John Ed has \nbeen informative and fair. His listeners could count on a funny and \nenlightening show every morning.\n  John Ed is blessed with a wonderful family. I suspect that his \nnewfound free time will give him the opportunity to enjoy more time \nwith his wife Jean, son J, daughter-in-law Kim and granddaughter \nSamantha Jean. Incidentally, J Willoughby has assumed the reins from \nhis father, and is on the air with Richard Dixon.\n  John Ed has been a great friend to me and a familiar and loyal voice \nto so many in Alabama. He will be greatly missed by his devoted \nlisteners, but I am certain they join me in wishing him the very best \nas he embarks on many new endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4105-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF DR. PAUL W. DOERRER\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a privilege today to bring to \nthe attention of my colleagues the accomplishments of Dr. Paul W. \nDoerrer, the 2005 recipient of the Missouri Association of School \nAdministrators' Robert L. Pearce Award. The Pearce Award is the most \nprestigious honor that can be bestowed on a school superintendent in \nthe State of Missouri, particularly so because the honoree is selected \nby a committee of peers.\n  The Ritenour School District in St. Louis County has been fortunate \nto have the leadership skills of Dr. Doerrer for the past 35 years. The \nMissouri Legislature and State board of education were in the forefront \nand enacted standards-based education long before the passage of No \nChild Left Behind. In fact, the standards set in Missouri are among the \nhighest in the Nation. Under the able instructional leadership of Dr. \nDoerrer, the Ritenour School District has not only met but in many \ncases has exceeded the rigorous goals our State has set for student \nachievement of adequate yearly progress. In addition, under Dr. \nDoerrer's able leadership, the Ritenour School District was recently \nnamed as one of the ``Best Places to Work'' by the St. Louis Business \nJournal.\n  Dr. Doerrer has truly exemplified instructional leadership in our \nState. Whether it is staff development, instructional technology, human \nresources, or data driven decisionmaking, Dr. Doerrer has provided the \nvision and energy that has brought distinction to the Ritenour School \nDistrict. It is with admiration that I honor Dr. Doerrer today and \ncongratulate him as the 19th recipient of the Robert L. Pearce \nAward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4105-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4105-S4106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ATTACHE SHOW CHOIR\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Attache Show Choir from Clinton \nHigh School in Clinton, MS, is celebrating 25 years of excellence and \nhas gained national recognition as the premier show choir in the \ncountry for its outstanding winning tradition. The Clinton High School \nAttache Show Choir was formed in September 1980 by Winona Costello. \nSince 1992, the award winning Attache\n\n[[Page S4106]]\n\nShow Choir has been under the direction of David and Mary Fehr who \ntruly have a passion for excellence.\n  Since 1980, Attache has established a winning tradition by capturing \n52 Grand Champion titles, 5 second place titles, and 4 third place \ntitles in 64 competitions during the last 25 years at prestigious \ncompetitions throughout the Nation. Nationally, Attache has achieved \nunprecedented recognition and has received numerous awards through the \nyears for Best Vocals, Best Choreography, Best Overall Effect, Most \nCreative Show, Best Show Design, Best Repertoire, Best Costume Design, \nBest Visuals, Best Instrumental Combo, Best Rhythm Section, and Best \nBrass Section competing against choirs from all over the Nation. In its \nlast 35 competitions dating back to the 1995/1996 season, Attache has \ncaptured the Grand Champion title 33 times. During the last 15 \nconsecutive competitions, Attache has captured Grand Champion titles \nand therefore, has the longest grand champion winning streak of any \nshow choir in the Nation.\n  In the last 10, Attache has had the privilege of hosting a number of \ncompetitions, including Showstoppers Invitational in Orlando, FL, and \nShow Choir Nationals in Nashville, TN, where they also performed the \nopening number at the Grand Ole Opry in March 2005. During the 2005 \ncompetition season, Attache captured Grand Champion titles at the 10th \nAnniversary Fame Show Choir Cup in Branson, MO; the Fame Show Choir \nAmerica in Orlando, FL; the Petal Invitational in Petal, MS and the \nBuchanan Invitational in Troy, MO.\n  Attache has gained extensive praise and accolade for their remarkable \ntalent, phenomenal showmanship, and extraordinary success. It is with \ngreat pride to recognize the contributions of this nationally known \nmusical group which has brought honor to its school, its community, and \nto the State of Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4106-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4106-2", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4106-3", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 504.

A bill to encourage savings, promote financial literacy, and \nexpand opportunities for young adults by establishing KIDS Accounts; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing ``The America \nSaving for Personal Investment, Retirement, and Education (ASPIRE) Act \nof 2005'' along with Senator Corzine, Senator Schumer and Senator \nDeMint. A bipartisan group of members is introducing companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives. The bill creates a Kids \nInvestment and Development Savings (KIDS) Account for every child at \nbirth and creates a new opportunity for the children of low-income \nAmericans to build assets and wealth.\n  This country has seen a growing number of Americans investing in the \nstock market and has witnessed an historic boom in homeownership, which \nhas increased to record high levels. However, this growth in assets has \nnot reached every American. While many middle- and upper-income \nfamilies have increased their assets in the past decade, many low-\nincome families have not had the same financial success. A recent study \nconducted by the Federal Reserve found that the median net worth of \nfamilies in the bottom 20 percent of the nation's income level was a \nmere $7,900--an amount that is far too low to ensure a comfortable \neconomic future for their family. This challenge needs to be addressed \nto ensure that lower income families have a significant opportunity to \naccrue wealth and expand opportunities for their families.\n  Under this legislation, KIDS Accounts would be created after a child \nis born and a Social Security number issued. A one-time $500 deposit \nwould automatically be placed into a KIDS account. Children from \nhouseholds below the national median income would receive an additional \ndeposit of $500 at birth and would be eligible to receive dollar-for-\ndollar matching funds up to $500 per year for voluntary contributions \nto the account, which cannot exceed $1,000 per year. All funds grow \ntax-free. Access to the account prior to age 18 would not be permitted, \nbut kids--in conjunction with their parents--would participate in \ninvestment decisions and watch their money grow. When the young person \nturns 18, he or she can use the accrued money for asset building \npurposes such as education, homeownership, and retirement planning. \nAccrued funds could also be rolled over into a Roth IRA or 529 post-\nsecondary education account to expand investment options.\n  I would like to highlight what I view as the two major benefits of \nthis legislation. The first, and most apparent, is that this bill will \nhelp give younger individuals, especially low-income Americans, a sound \nfinancial start to begin their adult life. For example, a typical low-\nincome family making modest but steady contributions can create a KIDS \nAccount worth over $20,000 in 18 years. Second, and perhaps more \nimportant, is that KIDS Accounts create opportunities for all Americans \nto become more financially literate. The account holders and their \nguardians will choose from a list of possible investment funds and will \nbe able to watch their investment grow over time. All Americans will \nhave the opportunity to see firsthand that a smart investment now can \ngrow over time into considerable wealth.\n  I believe that this bill could be a significant and strategic step \nforward in the effort to expand asset opportunities to all Americans, \nand lower-income Americans in particular. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this bipartisan effort.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators \nSantorum, Schumer, and DeMint in introducing the ASPIRE Act of 2005, \nwhich would expand opportunities for young adults, encourage savings, \nand promote financial literacy, by establishing investment accounts, \nknown as KIDS Accounts, for every child in America.\n  ASPIRE is based largely on a similar initiative in the United Kingdom \ndeveloped by Prime Minister Tony Blair. Yet despite its British roots, \nthe proposal is based on the most basic of American values. By giving \nevery young person resources with which to get a start in life, ASPIRE \nwill help realize the American ideal of equal opportunity. And by \nmaking every young person an investor, the proposal would encourage \nself reliance, promote savings, and give every family a personal stake \nin America's economy.\n  Under ASPIRE, an investment account would be established for every \nAmerican child upon receiving a Social Security number. Each account \nwould be funded initially with $500. Those with incomes less than the \nnational median would receive an additional contribution of up to $500, \nand would receive a one-for-one government match for their first $500 \nof private contributions each year. Up to $1000 of after-tax private \ncontributions would be allowed annually from any source.\n  Funds would accumulate tax-free and could not be withdrawn for \npurposes other than higher education until the child reaches the age of \n18. At that point, funds could be withdrawn, according to Roth IRA \nguidelines, either for higher education or for the purchase of a home. \nFunds left unspent would be saved for retirement under rules similar to \nthose that apply to Roth IRAs or rolled over to a 529 plan for \neducational expenses. Once the account holder reaches the age of 30, \nthe initial $500 government contribution would have to be repaid, \nthough exceptions could be made to avoid undue hardship.\n  Accounts initially would be held by a government entity that would be \nbased on the successful Thrift Savings Plan, or TSP, which now manages \nretirement accounts for Federal employees with relatively low \nadministrative costs. As with the TSP, investors would have a range of \ninvestment options, such as a Government securities fund, a fixed \nincome investment fund, and a common stock fund. However, once an \naccount holder reaches the age of 18, funds could be rolled over to a \nKIDS Account held at a private institution.\n  It is difficult to understate the potential impact of giving every \nAmerican child a funded investment account of their own. For the first \ntime, every child will have a meaningful incentive to learn the basics \nof investing, because they will have real resources to invest. For the \nfirst time, even families with modest incomes will have a significant \nincentive to save, to earn the government match. And, perhaps most \nfundamentally, for the first time, every American child will grow up \nknowing that when they reach adulthood, they will have the ability to \ninvest in themselves and in their own education. In short, every child \nwill have hope for a real future.\n  Considering its potentially significant social and individual \nbenefits, the ASPIRE Act requires an investment that is relatively \nmodest. It has been\n\n[[Page S4113]]\n\nestimated that, when it becomes effective, the bill's cost would \nrepresent only about one tenth of one percent of the Federal budget. \nYet the proposal differs from other proposals for new spending or tax \ncuts because, for the first 18 years, it would not reduce overall \nnational savings at all. In that period, virtually every dollar of \noutlays would be saved, and would be available to expand long-term \neconomic growth. In fact, the proposal would lead to an increase in \nnational savings because of its incentives for families to save more. \nThis would help create the economic growth we need to handle the added \nburdens associated with the impending retirement of the baby boomers.\n  Senator Santorum and I are excited to be joined this year by Senators \nSchumer and DeMint as sponsors of ASPIRE, along with sponsors of \nidentical legislation in the House, Congressmen Harold Ford, Patrick \nKennedy, Thomas Petri and Phil English. In that process, we have been \nassisted by a broad range of experts and other interested parties, for \nwhich I am very grateful. However, I want to especially thank Ray \nBoshara and Reid Cramer of the New America Foundation, who have been \nextraordinarily helpful in the development of the legislation, and who \nhave taken the lead in efforts to promote this and other asset building \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. President, the ASPIRE Act is a big new idea based on simple, old \ntime American values. It already enjoys strong bipartisan support from \nconservatives and progressives, alike, in both houses of Congress. I \nlook forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsecure its prompt enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 869. A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to prohibit \nthe Secretary of Agriculture from basing minimum prices for class 1 \nmilk on the distance or transportation costs from any location that is \nnot within a marketing area, except under certain circumstances, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am offering a measure which \ncould serve as a first step towards eliminating the inequities borne by \nthe dairy farmers of Wisconsin and the upper Midwest under the Federal \nMilk Marketing Order system.\n  The Federal Milk Marketing Order system, created nearly 60 years ago, \nestablishes minimum prices for milk paid to producers throughout \nvarious marketing areas in the U.S. For sixty years, this system has \ndiscriminated against producers in the Upper Midwest by awarding a \nhigher price to dairy farmers in proportion to the distance of their \nfarms from areas of high milk production, which historically have been \nthe region around Eau Claire, WI.\n  My legislation is very simple. It identifies the single most harmful \nand unjust feature of the current system, and corrects it. Under the \ncurrent archaic law, the price farmers receive for fluid milk is higher \nthe further they are from the Eau Claire region of the Upper Midwest. \nThis provision originally was intended to guarantee the supply of fresh \nmilk from the high production areas to distant markets in an age of \ndifficult transportation and limited refrigeration. But the situation \nhas long since changed and the provision persists at the detriment of \nthe Wisconsin farmers even though most local milk markets do not \nreceive any milk from Wisconsin.\n  The bill I introduce today would prohibit the Secretary of \nAgriculture from using distance or transportation costs from any \nlocation as the basis for pricing milk, unless significant quantities \nof milk are actually transported from that location into the recipient \nmarket. The Secretary will have to comply with the statutory \nrequirement that supply and demand factors be considered as specified \nin the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act when setting milk prices in \nmarketing orders. The fact remains that single-basing-point pricing \nsimply cannot be justified based on supply and demand for milk both in \nlocal and national markets and the changing pattern of U.S. milk \nproduction.\n  This bill also requires the Secretary to report to Congress on \nspecifically which criteria are used to set milk prices. Finally, the \nSecretary will have to certify to Congress that the criteria used by \nthe Department do not in any way attempt to circumvent the prohibition \non using distance or transportation cost as basis for pricing milk.\n  This one change is vitally important to Upper Midwest producers, \nbecause the current system has penalized them for many years. The \ncurrent system is a double whammy to Upper Midwest dairy farmers--it \nboth provides disparate profits for producers in other parts of the \ncountry and creates artificial economic incentives for milk production. \nAs a result, Wisconsin producers have seen national surpluses rise, and \nmilk prices fall. Rather than providing adequate supplies of fluid \nmilk, the prices often lead to excess production.\n  The prices have provided production incentives beyond those needed to \nensure a local supply of fluid milk in some regions, leading to an \nincrease in manufactured products in those marketing orders. Those \nmanufactured products directly compete with Wisconsin's processed \nproducts, eroding our markets and driving national prices down.\n  The perverse nature of this system is further illustrated by the fact \nthat since 1995, some regions of the U.S., notably the central states \nand the Southwest, are producing so much milk that they are actually \nshipping fluid milk north to the Upper Midwest. The high fluid milk \nprices have generated so much excess production, that these markets \ndistant from Eau Claire are now encroaching upon not only our \nmanufactured markets, but also our markets for fluid milk, further \neroding prices in Wisconsin.\n  The market-distorting effects of the fluid price differentials in \nfederal orders are shown by a previous Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis that estimated that the elimination of orders would save $669 \nmillion over five years. Government outlays would fall, CBO concluded, \nbecause production would fall in response to lower milk prices and \nthere would be fewer government purchases of surplus milk. The regions \nthat would gain and lose in this scenario illustrate the discrimination \ninherent to the current system. Economic analyses showed that farm \nrevenues in a market undisturbed by Federal orders would actually \nincrease in the Upper Midwest and fall in most other milk-producing \nregions.\n  While this system has been around since 1937, the practice of basing \nfluid milk price differentials on the distance from Eau Claire was \nformalized in the 1960s, when the Upper Midwest arguably was the \nprimary reserve for additional supplies of milk. The idea was to \nencourage local supplies of fluid milk in areas of the country that did \nnot traditionally produce enough fluid milk to meet their own needs.\n  That is no longer the case. The Upper Midwest is no longer the \nprimary source of reserve supplies of milk. Unfortunately, the prices \ndidn't adjust with changing economic conditions, most notably the shift \nof the dairy industry away from the Upper Midwest and towards the \nSouthwest, and specifically California, which now leads the nation in \nmilk production.\n  The result of this antiquated system has been a decline in the Upper \nMidwest dairy industry, not because it can't produce a product that can \ncompete in the marketplace, but because the system discriminates \nagainst it. Over the past few years Wisconsin has lost dairy farmers at \na rate of more than 5 per day. The Upper Midwest, with the lowest fluid \nmilk prices, is shrinking as a dairy region despite the dairy-friendly \nclimate of the region. Some other regions with higher fluid milk prices \nare growing rapidly.\n  In a free market with a level playing field, these shifts in \nproduction might be fair. But in a market where the government is \nsetting the prices and providing that artificial advantage to regions \noutside the Upper Midwest, the current system is unconscionable.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and bring reform to this \noutdated system and work to eliminate the inequities in the current \nmilk marketing order pricing system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\n                                 S. 869\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONTRACT REQUIREMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Office may enter into contracts with \n     qualified carriers offering health benefits plans of the type \n     described in section 8903 or 8903a of title 5, United States \n     Code, without regard to section 5 of title 41, United States \n     Code, or other statutes requiring competitive bidding, to \n     provide health insurance coverage to employees of \n     participating employers under this Act. Each contract shall \n     be for a uniform term of at least 1 year, but may be made \n     automatically renewable from term to term in the absence of \n     notice of termination by either party. In entering into such \n     contracts, the Office shall ensure that health benefits \n     coverage is provided for individuals only, married \n     individuals without children, and families.\n       (b) Eligibility.--A carrier shall be eligible to enter into \n     a contract under subsection (a) if such carrier--\n       (1) is licensed to offer health benefits plan coverage in \n     each State in which the plan is offered; and\n       (2) meets such other requirements as determined appropriate \n     by the Office.\n       (c) Statement of Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--Each contract under this Act shall contain \n     a detailed statement of benefits offered and shall include \n     information concerning such maximums, limitations, \n     exclusions, and other definitions of benefits as the Office \n     considers necessary or desirable.\n       (2) Nationwide plan.--The Office shall develop a benefit \n     package that shall be offered in the case of a contract for a \n     health benefit plan that is to be offered on a nationwide \n     basis.\n       (d) Standards.--The minimum standards prescribed for health \n     benefits plans under section 8902(e) of title 5, United \n     States Code, and for carriers offering plans, shall apply to \n     plans and carriers under this Act. Approval of a plan may be \n     withdrawn by the Office only after notice and opportunity for \n     hearing to the carrier concerned without regard to subchapter \n     II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of title 5, United States Code.\n       (e) Conversion.--\n       (1) In general.--A contract may not be made or a plan \n     approved under this section if the carrier under such \n     contract or plan does not offer to each enrollee whose \n     enrollment in the plan is ended, except by a cancellation of \n     enrollment, a temporary extension of coverage during which \n     the individual may exercise the option to convert, without \n     evidence of good health, to a nongroup contract providing \n     health benefits. An enrollee who exercises this option shall \n     pay the full periodic charges of the nongroup contract.\n       (2) Noncancellable.--The benefits and coverage made \n     available under paragraph (1) may not be canceled by the \n     carrier except for fraud, over-insurance, or nonpayment of \n     periodic charges.\n       (f) Rates.--Rates charged under health benefits plans under \n     this Act shall reasonably and equitably reflect the cost of \n     the benefits provided. Such rates shall be determined on a \n     basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent \n     with the lowest schedule of basic rates generally charged for \n     new group health benefits plans issued to large employers. \n     The rates determined for the first contract term shall be \n     continued for later contract terms, except that they may be \n     readjusted for any later term, based on past experience and \n     benefit adjustments under the later contract. Any \n     readjustment in rates shall be made in advance of the \n     contract term in which they will apply and on a basis which, \n     in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the general \n     practice of carriers which issue group health benefits plans \n     to large employers. Rates charged for coverage under this Act \n     shall not vary based on health-status related factors.\n       (g) Requirement of Payment for or Provision of Health \n     Service.--Each contract entered into under this Act shall \n     require the carrier to agree to pay for or provide a health \n     service or supply in an individual case if the Office finds \n     that the employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, \n     or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of \n     title 5, United States Code, is entitled thereto under the \n     terms of the contract.\n\n     SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY.\n\n       An individual shall be eligible to enroll in a plan under \n     this Act if such individual--\n       (1) is an employee of an employer described in section \n     2(b)(2), or is a self employed individual as defined in \n     section 401(c)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; \n     and\n       (2) is not otherwise enrolled or eligible for enrollment in \n     a plan under chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 6.

and\n       (D) shall be adjusted to cover the administrative costs of \n     the Office under this Act.\n       (2) Determinations.--In determining rates and premiums \n     under this Act, the following provisions shall apply:\n       (A) In general.--A carrier that enters into a contract \n     under this Act shall determine that amount of premiums to \n     assess for coverage under a health benefits plan based on an \n     community rate that may be annually adjusted--\n\n[[Page S4116]]\n\n       (i) for the geographic area involved if the adjustment is \n     based on geographical divisions that are not smaller than a \n     metropolitan statistical area;\n       (ii) based on whether such coverage is for an individual, a \n     married individual with no children, or a family;

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to increase \nparticipation in section 401(k) plans through automatic contribution \ntrusts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Save More \nfor Retirement Act of 2005 with my colleagues Senator Snowe, Senator \nLieberman and Senator Obama. This legislation is designed to achieve \ntwo important savings goals. First, it will encourage workers who are \nnot currently participating in their employer's retirement plan to do \nso. Second, it will encourage workers who are currently investing in \n40l(k) plans to save even more. At a time when national savings is at a \nnear all-time low, Congress needs to look at ways to expand retirement \nsavings, particularly savings garnered through an employer-provided \nretirement plan. This legislation is a commonsense approach that is \nbased on research undertaken and compiled by a host of retirement \npolicy experts from both academia and business. It is imperative that \nthe Congress continues to look for new and innovative ways to help \nworkers save for their retirement through the existing employer-\nprovided plan system. This legislation accomplishes that goal by \ncreating incentives for employers to modify their existing plans to add \nfeatures that have been proven to increase savings.\n  The first step is to encourage employers to add a feature to its \n40l(k) or similar plans to enroll its employees in the plan upon being \nhired unless the employee notifies the employer that he or she does not \nwant to participate in the plan. The decision to participate still \nrests entirely with the employees, as they can opt out before \nparticipation begins or at any time afterward. Although some employers \ndo offer these types of plans now, most maintain a more traditional \nstructure under which the employee must opt into participating. Studies \nhave indicated that such a seemingly minor change in how employees are \nenrolled can dramatically increase participation rates. It has been \nreported that one large company experienced an increase in employee \nparticipation in their retirement plan of 50 percent once the features \nwere changed to automatically enroll its employees. Clearly the first \nstep towards increasing our national savings rate is to get more people \nsaving.\n  Obviously the second step is to get those who are saving to set aside \neven more for their retirement years. For this reason, the legislation \nwould encourage plans to add a feature that increases employees' \ncontributions annually until it reaches at least 10 percent of the \nemployees' compensation. Again, studies have repeatedly demonstrated \nthat people are more likely to agree to save more in the future than \nthey currently do. It has also been demonstrated that people are more \nlikely to agree to save more in the future if they make the decision \ntoday and do not wait until future years to make that decision. In our \nlegislation, the employee can stop a future increase or change the \ncontribution rate. The employer has the discretion to tie these \nautomatic increases to either an annual increase or to increases in \nsalary or compensation. This is closely modeled on the Save More \nTomorrow, SMarT, plan advocated by Shlomo Benartzi from UCLA and \nRichard Thaler from the University of Chicago. These behavioral finance \nexperts claim that although participants in this plan may start saving \nat a lower rate--3.5 percent--than the average, within 4 years \nincreases averaged 13.6 percent--a greater than 10 percent increase. \nCompared to the control group saving rate of slightly more than 8 \npercent of their compensation, the end result is quite extraordinary.\n  To encourage employers to make these two changes to the plan, the \nlegislation creates a new safe harbor that, if all the criteria are \nmet, treats the plan as being nondiscriminatory. In order to qualify \nfor the safe harbor, the employer must provide either a nonelective \nmatch of 3 percent of the employee's compensation or an elective match \nof 50 percent of the first 7 percent of the employee's compensation. \nThese criteria can be met also if the employer contributes a comparable \namount to another qualified plan for the same employees. The employer \nmust also allow its contributions to vest in either 2 years, if the \nemployer enrolls the employees in its pension plan before the \nemployees' first paycheck, or in 1 year if the employer enrolls the \nemployees within the first quarter of being hired. It is important to \nnote that both of these vesting periods are shorter than current law \nallows and are comparable to what employers can do under the existing \nsafe harbor.\n  Finally, in an effort to help ensure employees are invested wisely, \nthe legislation directs the Department of Labor to provide guidance for \nemployers in selecting ``default'' investments so that employers have \noptions besides money market accounts and investment contracts. A \ndefault investment is the investment that is made when\n\n[[Page S4119]]\n\nemployees fail to indicate how they would like their retirement savings \ninvested. Due to liability concerns, retirement plans tend to invest \nthese funds in either investment contracts or money market accounts. \nThe benefit of compounding interest that would occur with even modest \nreturns in broad-based funds that have an equity component is lost. \nThis guidance will not allow employers to make default investment \ndecisions that are risky or put the employee's retirement at risk. It \nis important to note that the employee always retains the ability to \ninvest the funds differently in other investment options offered by the \nplan if they do not like the default investment offered by the \nemployer.\n  I thank all of those who have done considerable research into the \nimpact of human behavior on savings, which was quite instrumental to \nthe drafting of this legislation. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith them and others interested in this new approach to addressing our \nNation's savings problems.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit human cloning and protect stem cell \nresearch; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join with Senators \nFeinstein, Specter, Kennedy, and Harkin to introduce the Human Cloning \nBan and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2005. This bill could help \nusher in the next great era of medical treatment. At the same time, it \nwill criminalize the offensive practice of reproductive cloning.\n  If you remember when Jonas Salk discovered the polio vaccine, you \nwill recall what a revolutionary step that was, to be able to stop \nravaging diseases before they hit their victims. It led to a whole new \nway of practicing medicine and paved the way for the vaccines and \ntreatments that we take for granted today.\n  I believe we are on the verge of a similar step, a new generation in \nmedical research and treatment, thanks to the incredible potential of \nstem cells. Stem cell research--particularly, embryonic stem cell \nresearch--holds great promise. To quote Nobel Laureate Dr. Harold \nVarmus, ``The development of cell lines that may produce almost every \ntissue of the human body is an unprecedented scientific breakthrough. \nIt is not too unrealistic to say that this research has the potential \nto revolutionize the practice of medicine and improve the quality and \nlength of life.''\n  As Dr. Varmus noted, embryonic stem cells appear to have the amazing \npotential to transform themselves into any of the more than 200 types \nof cells that form the human body. These cells\n\n[[Page S4121]]\n\ncould be the key to understanding much about human health and disease \nand may yield new diagnostic tests, treatments, and cures for diseases \nsuch as diabetes, cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, autoimmune \ndiseases, and many, many others.\n  Stem cell research could potentially be the scientific advance that \ntakes the practice of medicine not just to the next level, but to five \nor ten levels above and beyond. Like my colleagues, I believe there is \nan urgent need for uniformity in the rules governing stem cell research \nin America. But let me just stress one aspect of that need: ethics. \nWithout the National Institutes of Health setting the ethical \nguidelines for stem cell research, we invite a host of problems. Most \nof us feel strongly that human reproductive cloning is wrong, for \nexample. But where should the lines be drawn with regard to embryonic \nstem cell research--particularly, somatic cell nuclear transfer and the \nuse of cell lines derived from IVF embryos?\n  The NIH is the obvious and crucial choice to help set the ethical \nboundaries. Our bill will ban outright any attempt at bringing to life \na cloned human being. It will also prohibit research on any embryo \ncreated through somatic cell nuclear transfer beyond 14 days, require \ninformed consent of donors, prohibit profiteering from donated eggs, \nand mandate separation of the egg collection site from the research \nlaboratory.\n  The NIH will help determine other suitable ethical guidelines in \nallowing this critical research to go forward with Federal funding and \nat federally-funded institutions. There is no question in my mind that, \nwhen they do, the rest of the world will follow.\n  Now, the last time we introduced this bill, there was interest in the \nfact that I, as a strongly pro-life senator, would be the lead sponsor. \nI think we have put that issue behind us, as more pro-life lawmakers \nhave expressed their support for this research. The fact is, I have \nnever believed that life begins in a Petri dish. And as I travel across \nmy home State of Utah, more and more Utahns, whether they are pro-life \nor not, come up to me and say, ``Orrin, we're with you on this. You're \ndoing the right thing.''\n  That support is building across the country, and we must act. If we \ndo not seize this opportunity, other countries could take the leading \nrole in medicine's next great advance. We will lose the chance to set \nethical guidelines, we will lose doctors to overseas research \ninstitutions, and most importantly, we will lose the chance to offer \nnew hope to American and other patients who are waiting in desperation \nfor treatments and cures.\n  I urge the Senate to take up and pass this bill, and I look forward \nto the work ahead.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 876\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senators Hatch, Kennedy, \nSpecter, Harkin and I are introducing legislation to ban human \nreproductive cloning, while ensuring that important medical research \ngoes forward under strict oversight by the federal government.\n  Simply put, this legislation will enable research to be conducted \nthat provides hope to millions of Americans suffering from paralysis \nand debilitating diseases including Juvenile Diabetes, Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, cancer and heart disease.\n  Every member of this body knows someone--whether it's a parent or \ngrandparent, a child or a friend--who suffers from one of these \ndiseases. That is why this legislation is so critical. We must act now \nto protect promising research that will bring hope to those who suffer.\n  I now that every member of this body would agree that human \nreproductive cloning is immoral and unethical. It should be outlawed by \nCongress and the President. That is exactly what this bill does.\n  It prohibits any person from conducting or attempting to clone a \nhuman being. It also prohibits shipping materials for the purpose of \nhuman cloning in interstate or foreign commerce and prohibits the \nexport of an unfertilized blastocyst to a foreign country if such \ncountry does not prohibit human cloning.\n  Any person that violates this prohibition is subject to harsh \ncriminal and civil penalties. They include: imprisonment of up to 10 \nyears in federal prison.\n  Fines of up to $1 million or three times the gross profits resulting \nfrom the violation, whichever is greater.\n  This legislation draws a bright line between human reproductive \ncloning and promising medical research using somatic cell nuclear \ntransplantation for the sole purpose of deriving embryonic stem cells.\n  Somatic cell nuclear transplantation is the process by which \nscientists derive embryonic stem cells that are an exact genetic match \nas the patient. Those embryonic stem cells will one day be used to \ncorrect defective cells such as non-insulin producing or cancerous \ncells. Then those patients will not be forced to take immuno-\nsuppressive drugs and risk the chances of rejection since the new cells \nwill contain their own DNA.\n  It is truly astonishing that somatic cell nuclear transplantation \nresearch may one day be used to regrow tissue or organs that could lead \nto treatments and cures for diseases that afflict up to 100 million \nAmericans. What we are talking about here is research that does not \neven involve sperm and an egg.\n  I believe it is essential that this research be conducted with \nFederal Government oversight and under strict ethical requirements.\n  That is why the legislation: Mandates that eggs used in this research \nbe unfertilized.\n  Prohibits the purchase or sale of unfertilized eggs--to prevent \n``embryo farms'' or the possible exploitation of women.\n  Imposes strong ethics rules on scientists, mandating informed consent \nby egg donors, and include safety and privacy protections.\n  Prohibit any research on an unfertilized blastocyst after 14 days--\nAfter 14 days, an unfertilized blastocyst begins differentiating into a \nspecific type of cell such as a heart or brain cell and is no longer \nuseful for the purposes of embryonic stem cell research.\n  Requires that all egg donations be voluntary, and that there is no \nfinancial or other incentive for egg donations.\n  Requires that nuclear transportation occur in labs completely \nseparate from labs that engage in in vitro fertilization.\n  And for those who violate or attempt to violate the ethical \nrequirements of the legislation, they will be subject to civil \npenalties of up to $250,000 per violation.\n  Embryonic stem cell research that is currently being done using \nprivate funds, in animal models, and by scientists overseas continues \nto show great promise and potential. This progress will not be \nsustained in the U.S. without additional stem cell lines for federally-\nfunded research and without strict federal oversight of this research.\n  Senator Hatch and I have argued this point for years. What has \nhappened since the President limited federally-funded research to only \nthose embryonic stem cell lines derived prior to August 9, 2001?\n  Researchers have made a number of advancements confirming the promise \nof embryonic stem cells using animal models and private research \ndollars. In the absence of federal policy on embryonic stem cell \nresearch and human reproductive cloning, States have taken action \ncreating a patchwork of state laws under varying ethical frameworks. \nFewer researchers are choosing to go into this field given the void \ncreated by Federal inaction.\n  Last January, a study published by researchers from the University of \nCalifornia San Diego and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies \nconfirmed that all 22 existing federally-approved stem cell lines are \ntainted by mouse feeders cells and cannot be used in humans.\n  Researchers at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, MA, used \nembryonic stem cells created by somatic cell nuclear transplantation to \ncure a genetic defect in mice.\n  Researchers at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York found that \nembryonic stem cells produce proteins\n\n[[Page S4123]]\n\nthat can help ailing organs repair themselves.\n  Stanford scientists were able to relieve diabetes symptoms in mice by \nusing special chemicals to transform undifferentiated embryonic stem \ncells of mice into cell masses that resemble islets found in the mouse \npancreas.\n  In the absence of federal legislation, we have seen a patchwork of \nState laws under varying ethical frameworks and this is extremely \nworrisome. In total, 30 States have passed laws pertaining to stem cell \nresearch and there is tremendous variety in those laws.\n  California launched a $3 billion initiative to fund embryonic stem \ncell research including somatic cell nuclear transplantation research \nwhich bans human reproductive cloning.\n  At least 6 academic centers in California including UC San Francisco, \nStanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine and UC Davis have already begun \ndeveloping facilities where this embryonic stem cell research will be \nconducted and are all actively recruiting stem cell biologists from \nacross the country.\n\n  New Jersey has proposed a $380 million initiative to fund embryonic \nstem cell research.\n  Wisconsin has proposed investing $750 million to support embryonic \nstem cell research.\n  By contrast, Arkansas, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Michigan \nhave specifically prohibited nuclear transfer used to create stem \ncells. And 22 other States have enacted laws on the matter.\n  What this means is researchers and research money are now moving to \nStates with pro-research laws and pro-research Governors.\n  There is clearly a void that needs to be filled--and it can only be \nfilled by the Federal Government.\n  To be clear, this is research that involves an unfertilized \nblastocyst. No sperm are involved. It is conducted in a petri dish and \ncannot occur beyond 14 days. It is also prohibited from ever being \nimplanted into a woman to create a child.\n  For those who believe that the clump of cells in a petri dish that we \nare talking about is a human life, that is a moral decision each person \nmust make for himself, but to impose that view on the more than 100 \nmillion of our parents, children and friends who suffer from \nParkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer is immoral.\n  As former Senator and Episcopal minister John C. Danforth said \nrecently in an op-ed in the New York Times, ``Criminalizing the work of \nscientists doing such research would give strong support to one \nreligious doctrine, and it would punish people who believe it is their \nreligious duty to use science to heal the sick.\n  This is exactly why the legislation I am introducing with my \ncolleagues Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Specter and Harkin is needed. I \nurge the Senate to take up and pass this bill and help turn the hopes \nof millions of Americans into reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     Coalition for the Advancement\n\n\n                                          of Medical Research,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2005.\n     Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, 331 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, On behalf of the Coalition for the \n     Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR), I am writing to add \n     our strong support for the introduction of the Human Cloning \n     Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2005. Along with \n     Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), \n     Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), and Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA), \n     your leadership in protecting research using somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer (SCNT), also known as therapeutic cloning, \n     is greatly appreciated.\n       This year, Congress will address the future of biomedical \n     research and the Nation's efforts to prevent, treat, and cure \n     such debilitating diseases as cancer, juvenile diabetes, ALS, \n     Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and many more. Let \n     me be clear, CAMR supports a ban on reproductive cloning; it \n     is unsafe and unethical. Given the scientific potential of \n     SCNT and regenerative medicine, however, we strongly support \n     the bill's effort to allow for this research, which may \n     provide essential tools allowing scientists to develop the \n     promise of embryonic stern cell research. I am sure you will \n     agree, therapeutic cloning is about saving and improving \n     lives. It is fW1damemally different from human reproductive \n     cloning; it produces stem cells, not babies.\n       CAMR applauds your leadership in sponsoring legislation \n     that ensures cures for devastating diseases continue to be \n     developed. We look forward to working with you.\n           Thank you,\n                                                     Daniel Perry,\n                                                        President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join Senator Hatch, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Specter and Senator Harkin in sponsoring the Human \nCloning Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2005. This \nbipartisan proposal will outlaw human cloning and open the way to \nproper, ethical cures for our most feared diseases.\n  Using cloning to reproduce a child is improper and immoral--and our \nlegislation will make it illegal. Medicine must advance hand in hand \nwith ethics, and the legislation we introduce today will make certain \nthat American research sets the gold standard for ethical oversight.\n  But it is wrong to deny the great potential of medical research using \nthe remarkable new techniques of stem cell research, which can save \nlives by preventing, treating, and curing a wide range of severe \ndiseases and disabilities.\n  We see the benefits of investment in biotechnology all around us. \nFifty years ago last week, Jonas Salk announced the first polio \nvaccine. Imagine a world without that extraordinary discovery--where \npeoples everywhere lived in fear of the polio virus and the devastation \nit brings.\n  Thirty years ago, Congress was considering whether to ban research on \nrecombinant DNA--the very foundation of biotechnology.\n  Time after time, we heard of the medical advances that this new field \nof research would bring. Then--as now--some dismissed this promise as a \npipe dream and urged Congress to forbid it. We chose instead to vote \nfor new hope and new cures. Today, countless Americans and persons \nthroughout the world are already benefiting from the new treatments \nthat biotechnology has brought. Why call a halt?\n  In the 1980s Congress made the right choice, again, by rejecting \nattempts to outlaw in vitro fertilization, a technique that has \nfulfilled the hopes and dreams of thousands of parents who would never \nhave been able to have a child.\n  Our debate today is no different and Congress should do all it can to \nsupport lifesaving research, not prohibit it.\n  Other nations are more than willing to leave us behind. The potential \nof this research is so immense that some of our best scientists are \nalready leaving America to pursue their dreams in research laboratories \nin other countries. We need to stop that exodus before it becomes a \nnightmare. Do we really want to wake up 10 years from now and hear that \na former American scientist in another land has won the Nobel Prize in \nmedicine for a landmark discovery in stem cell research?\n  The misguided fears of today can't be allowed to deny the cures of \ntomorrow. I commend my colleagues for their leadership on this \nimportant legislation, and I hope the Senate will act quickly to \napprove this urgently needed bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Frist, Mr. \n        Lugar, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Alexander, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Allard, and Mr. \n        Corzine):\n  S. 877. A bill to provide for a biennial budget process and a \nbiennial appropriations process and to enhance oversight and the \nperformance of the Federal Government; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lieberman, the \ndistinguished Ranking Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee and \neleven other Senators, I rise to introduce the ``Biennial Budgeting and \nAppropriations Act,'' a bill to convert the annual budget and \nappropriations process to a two-year cycle and to enhance oversight of \nfederal programs.\n  Our most recent experience with the Omnibus Consolidated \nAppropriations Act shows the need for a biennial appropriations and \nbudget process. That one bill clearly demonstrated Congress is \nincapable of completing the budget, authorizing, and appropriations \nprocess on an annual basis. That 1,000 plus paged bill contained nine \nof the regular appropriations bills.\n  Congress should now act to streamline the system by moving to a two-\n\n[[Page S4124]]\n\nyear, or biennial, budget process. This is the most important reform we \ncan enact to streamline the budget process, to make the Senate a more \ndeliberative and effective institution, and to make us more accountable \nto the American people.\n  Moving to a biennial budget and appropriations process enjoys very \nbroad support. President Bush has supported a biennial budgeting \nprocess. Presidents Clinton, Reagan and Bush also proposed a biennial \nappropriations and budget cycle. Leon Panetta, who served as White \nHouse Chief of Staff, OMB Director, and House Budget Committee \nChairman, has advocated a biennial budget since the late 1970s. Former \nOMB and CBO Director Alice Rivlin has called for a biennial budget the \npast two decades. The Majority Leader is a co-sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Vice President Gore's National Performance Review and the 1993 Joint \nCommittee on the Reorganization of Congress both recommended a biennial \nappropriations and budget cycle.\n  A biennial budget will dramatically improve the current budget \nprocess. The current annual budget process is redundant, inefficient, \nand destined for failure each year. Look at what we struggle to \ncomplete each year under the current annual process. The annual budget \nprocess consumes three years: one year for the Administration to \nprepare the President's budget, another year for the Congress to put \nthe budget into law, and the final year to actually execute the budget.\n  Today, I want to focus just on the Congressional budget process, the \nprocess of annually passing a budget resolution, authorization \nlegislation, and multiple appropriation bills. The record clearly shows \nthat last year's experience was nothing new. Under the annual process, \nwe consistently fail to complete action on multiple appropriations \nbills, to authorize programs, and to meet our deadlines.\n  While we have made a number of improvements in the budget process, \nthe current annual process is redundant and inefficient. The Senate has \nthe same debate, amendments and votes on the same issue three or four \ntimes a year--once on the budget resolution, again on the authorization \nbill, and finally on the appropriations bill.\n  A few years ago, I asked the Congressional Research Service (CRS) to \nupdate and expand upon an analysis of the amount of time we spend on \nthe budget. CRS looked at all votes on appropriations, revenue, \nreconciliation, and debt limit measures as well as budget resolutions. \nCRS then examined any other vote dealing with budgetary levels, Budget \nAct waivers, or votes pertaining to the budget process. Beginning with \n1980, budget related votes started dominating the work of the Senate. \nIn 1996, 73 percent of the votes the Senate took were related to the \nbudget.\n  If we cannot adequately focus on our duties because we are constantly \ndebating the budget throughout the authorizing, budgeting, and \nappropriations process, just imagine how confused the American public \nis about what we are doing. The result is that the public does not \nunderstand what we are doing and it breeds cynicism about our \ngovernment.\n  Under the legislation I am introducing today, the President would \nsubmit a 2-year budget and Congress would consider a 2-year budget \nresolution and 2-year appropriation bills during the first session of a \nCongress. The second session of the Congress would be devoted to \nconsideration of authorization bills and for oversight of government \nagencies.\n  Most of the arguments against a biennial budget process will come \nfrom those who claim we cannot predict or plan on a two year basis. For \nmost of the budget, we do not actually budget on an annual basis. Our \nentitlement and revenue laws are under permanent law and Congress does \nnot change these laws on an annual basis. The only component of the \nbudget that is set in law annually are the appropriated, or \ndiscretionary, accounts.\n  The most predictable category of the budget are these appropriated, \nor discretionary, accounts of the federal government. Much of this \nspending is associated with international activities or emergencies. \nBecause most of this funding cannot be predicted on an annual basis, a \nbiennial budget is no less deficient than the current annual process. \nMy bill does not preclude supplemental appropriations necessary to meet \nthese emergency or unanticipated requirements.\n  In 1993 I had the honor to serve as co-Chairman on a Joint Committee \nthat studied the operations of the Congress. Senator Byrd testified \nbefore that Committee that the increasing demands put on us as Senators \nhas led to our ``fractured attention.'' We simply are too busy to \nadequately focus on the people's business. This legislation is designed \nto free up time and focus our attention, particularly with respect to \nthe oversight of Federal programs and activities.\n  Frankly, the limited oversight we are now doing is not as good as it \nshould be. Our authorizing committees are increasingly crowded out of \nthe legislative process. Under a biennial budget, the second year of \nthe biennium will be exclusively devoted to examining federal programs \nand developing authorization legislation. The calendar will be free of \nthe budget and appropriations process, giving these committees the time \nand opportunity to provide oversight, review and legislate changes to \nfederal programs. Oversight and the authorization should be an ongoing \nprocess, but a biennial appropriations process will provide greater \nopportunity for legislators to concentrate on programs and policies in \nthe second year.\n  Mr. President, a biennial budget cannot make the difficult decisions \nthat must be made in budgeting, but it can provide the tools necessary \nto make much better decisions. Under the current annual budget process \nwe are constantly spending the taxpayers' money instead of focusing on \nhow best and most efficiently we should spend the taxpayers' money. By \nmoving to a biennial budget cycle, we can plan, budget, and appropriate \nmore effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, and \nimprove the efficiency of government agencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to \npermanently prohibit the conduct of offshore drilling on the Outer \nContinental Shelf in the Mid-Atlantic and North Atlantic planning \nareas; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Lautenberg, I \nam introducing legislation, the Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism Anti-\nDrilling Act, or COAST Anti-Drilling Act, to ban oil and gas drilling \noff the Mid-Atlantic and Northern Atlantic coast.\n  The people of New Jersey, and other residents of States along the \nAtlantic Coast, do not want oil or gas rigs anywhere near their \ntreasured beaches and fishing grounds. Such drilling poses serious \nthreats not only to our environment, but to our economy, which depends \nheavily on tourism along our shore. Coastal tourism is New Jersey's \nsecond-largest industry, and the New Jersey Shore is one of the fastest \ngrowing regions in the country. According to the New Jersey Department \nof Commerce, tourism in the Garden State generates more than $31 \nbillion in spending, directly and indirectly supports more than 836,000 \njobs, more than 20 percent of total State employment, generates more \nthan $16.6 billion in wages, and brings in more than $5.5 billion in \ntax revenues to the State.\n  Until the Bush administration came into office, there was no reason \nto suspect that drilling was even a remote possibility. Since 1982, a \nstatutory moratorium on leasing activities in most Outer Continental \nShelf, OCS, areas has been included annually in Interior appropriations \nacts. In addition, President George H.W. Bush declared a leasing \nmoratorium on many OCS areas on June 26, 1990, under section 12 of the \nOCS Lands Act. On June 12, 1998, President Clinton used the same \nauthority to issue a memorandum to the Secretary of the Interior that \nextended the moratorium through 2012 and included additional OCS areas.\n  Given the longstanding consensus against drilling in these areas, I \nwas deeply disturbed to discover that on May 31, 2001, the Minerals \nManagement Service released a request for proposals, RFP, to conduct a \nstudy of the environmental impacts of drilling in the Mid- and North-\nAtlantic. The RFP noted that ``there are areas with some reservoir \npotential, for example off the coast of New Jersey.'' In addition, the \nRFP explained that the study would be conducted ``in anticipation of \nmanaging the exploitation of potential and proven reserves.'' I \nbelieved that the RFP was inappropriate and misguided, and I was \npleased when at my urging and the urging of other coastal Senators, the \nadministration rescinded it.\n  After our strong bipartisan coalition fought off the Department of \nthe Interior RFP, our coastal coalition came together again to fight \noff the Outer Continental Shelf inventory provisions of last year's \nenergy bill. The bill directed the Department of the Interior to \ninventory all potential oil and natural gas resources in the entire \nOuter Continental Shelf, including areas off of the New Jersey coast. \nThe bill would have allowed the use of seismic surveys, dart core \nsampling, and other exploration technologies, all of which would leave \nthese areas vulnerable to oil spills, drilling discharges and damage to \ncoastal wetlands.\n  These provisions run directly counter to language that Congress has \nincluded annually in appropriations bills to prevent leasing, \npreleasing, and related activities in most areas of the Outer \nContinental Shelf, including areas off the New Jersey coast. \nFortunately, this provision was dropped last year, but it is likely \nthat it will resurface during debate on the Energy bill this year, and \nit is clear that we need to once and for all ban drilling off the coast \nof New Jersey and the rest of the Mid- and North-Atlantic.\n  So considering the minimal benefit and significant downside of \ndrilling off the coast of New Jersey, it is not worth threatening over \n800,000 New Jersey jobs to recover what the MMS estimated in 2000 to be \n196 million barrels\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nof oil, only enough to last the country barely 10 days.\n  I certainly don't think it is worth the risk, and it is time for \nCongress to act to resolve this question once and for all. That is why \nI am introducing the COAST Anti-Drilling Act. The Clean Ocean and Safe \nTourism Anti-Drilling Act would permanently ban drilling for oil, gas \nand other minerals in the Mid- and North-Atlantic.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important \nlegislation. Doing so would ensure the people of New Jersey and \nneighboring States that they need not fear the specter of oil rigs off \ntheir beaches.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 878\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Ocean and Safe Tourism \n     Anti-Drilling Act'' or the ``COAST Anti-Drilling Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION OF OIL AND GAS LEASING IN CERTAIN AREAS \n                   OF THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF.\n\n       Section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1337) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(p) Prohibition of Oil and Gas Leasing in Certain Areas \n     of the Outer Continental Shelf.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this section or any other law, the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall not issue a lease for the exploration, \n     development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other \n     mineral in--\n       ``(1) the Mid-Atlantic planning area; or\n       ``(2) the North Atlantic planning area.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 879.

Mr. President, it has been 20 years since the passage \nof the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984, a bill sponsored by the \nformer Senator Murkowski. The time has come to make some modifications \nto reflect the experience we've gained over that time.\n  I'm pleased to note that the amendments I introducing today are \nreally very modest, an indication that the act--and the presidential \ncommission it created--have functioned quite well. These minimal \nchanges will, I hope, make them function even more smoothly.\n  First, the chairman of the Arctic Research Commission will be \nauthorized compensation for an additional 30 days of work during the \ncourse of a year. That is still far less than the actual number of days \ndemanded by the position, but will help. Second, the bill will allow \nthe Commission to stimulate additional interest in Arctic research by \nestablishing a professional award program for excellence in research. \nCurrent and former members of the Commission will not be eligible. \nAwards will be capped at a symbolic amount of $1,000, but the \nrecognition by each winner's scientific peers will be invaluable. Third \nand finally, the bill will allow the Commission to reciprocate in the \nexpected manner when foreign delegations host a reception or other \nevent. This provision is limited to no more than two-tenths of a \npercent of the Commission budget--as with the award program, the value \nis primarily symbolic, but is nonetheless important.\n  Although these are small changes, they will help ensure a smoothly \nfunctioning Arctic Research Act, and that is important. Although it is \nnot something you hear about on a daily basis, the United States is a \nleader in the very small circle of Arctic nations, and the Congress \nplays a major role in ensuring that we remain a leader in this \ncritically important sphere. And make no mistake about it, the Arctic \nis critical to this country for social, strategic, economic and \nscientific reasons that are simply too plentiful to enumerate at this \ntime.\n  The main purposes of the Arctic Research and Policy Act are: 1, to \nestablish national policy for basic and applied research on Arctic \nresources and materials, physical, biological and health sciences, and \nsocial and behavioral sciences; 2, to establish the U.S. Arctic \nResearch Commission to promote Arctic research and to recommend \nresearch policies; 3, to designate the National Science Foundation as \nthe lead agency for implementing Arctic research; and, 4, to establish \nthe Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee, IARPC, which is \nresponsible for coordinating a multiplicity of Arctic research efforts \nthroughout the government.\n  As we continue to see evidence of Arctic warming--whether or not we \nconsider it to be human-caused or natural, global or regional--it is of \ntremendous importance to prepare as best we can. The future may hold \nboth positives--such as increased agricultural production and access to \nnatural resources--and negatives--such as widespread damage to existing \ninfrastructure, flooding, and sweeping social changes. The Arctic \nResearch Commission plays a vital role and deserves our full support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 879\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arctic Research and Policy \n     Amendments Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to expand the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farallones \nNational Marine Sanctuary and the Cordell Bank National Marine \nSanctuary; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Gulf of the \nFarallones and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries Boundary \nModification and Protection Act. I am joined in this effort by Senator \nFeinstein and Representative Lynn Woolsey who has introduced the \ncompanion bill in the other body.\n  The Gulf of the Farallones and the adjacent Cordell Bank are rich \nwith wildlife and are visually spectacular. They are one of \nCalifornia's--indeed America's--great natural treasures.\n  Thirty-three marine mammal species use this area. Over half of these \nare threatened or endangered. The sanctuaries also contain one of the \nlargest\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\npopulations of blue and humpback whales in the world. Every summer, \nmany grey whales dwell in the boundaries and neighboring waters of the \nsanctuaries. In addition, birds rely on the rich waters and surrounding \nland for nesting, feeding, and rearing of their young.\n  As effective as the current boundaries are in protecting this \nwildlife, new risks and a better understanding of the ecosystem \nnecessitate extending the existing boundaries.\n  My legislation would expand the boundaries of the two existing \nnational marine sanctuaries to protect the entire Sonoma Coast. By \nexpanding the boundaries of both the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell \nBank National Marine Sanctuaries, the bill will protect the Russian and \nGualala River estuaries and the nutrient-rich Bodega Canyon from \noffshore oil drilling and pollution.\n  Expanding these marine sanctuaries will help to ensure that they \nremain the treasures they are. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. \n        Murray, and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 881. A bill to provide for equitable compensation to the Spokane \nTribe of Indians of the Spokane Reservation for the use of tribal land \nfor the production of hydropower by the Grand Coulee Dam, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith my colleague from Washington State, Senator Murray, and former \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee chairman, Senator Inouye of Hawaii. The \nbill I submit today, which is identical to S. 1438 which passed the \nSenate unanimously on November 19, 2004, provides an equitable \nsettlement of a longer standing injustice to the Spokane Tribe of \nIndians.\n  For more than half a century, the Columbia Basin Project has made an \nextraordinary contribution to this Nation. It helped pull the economy \nout of the Great Depression. It provided the electricity that produced \naluminum required for airplanes and weapons that ensured our national \nsecurity. The project continues to produce enormous revenues for the \nUnited States. It is a key component of the agricultural economy in \neastern Washington and plays a pivotal role in the electric systems \nserving the entire western United States.\n  However, these benefits have come at a direct cost to tribal property \nthat became inundated when the U.S. Government built the Grand Coulee \nDam. Before dam construction, the free flowing Columbia River supported \nrobust and plentiful salmon runs and provided for virtually all of the \nsubsistence needs of the Spokane Tribe. After construction, the \nColumbia and its Spokane River tributary flooded tribal communities, \nschools, and roads, and the remaining stagnant water continues to erode \nreservation lands today.\n  The legislation Senators Inouye, Murray and I are introducing today \nis similar to P.L. 103-436, which was enacted in 1994 to provide just \ncompensation to the neighboring Confederated Colville Tribes. This bill \nwould provide the Spokane Tribe of Indians with compensation for the \nuse of its lands for the production of hydropower by the Grand Coulee \nDam under a formula based in part on that by which the Confederated \nTribes of the Colville Reservation were compensated in the Colville \nTribes' settlement legislation in 1994. The Spokane Tribe lost lands \nequivalent in area to 39.4 percent of the lands lost to Colville Tribes \na settlement based solely on this factor would result in a proportional \npayment of 39.4 percent to the Spokane Tribe. This was the formula \nbasis for similar Spokane settlement legislation introduced in the \nSenate and House in the 107th, 108th, and 109th Congress. However, \nbased upon good faith, honorable and extensive negotiations by and \nbetween the Spokane Tribe, the Bonneville Power Administration, the \nBureau of Reclamation the National Park Service during the past year, \nthis percentage has been reduced to 29 percent in recognition of the \nfact that certain lands taken for the construction of the Grand Coulee \nDam would be restored to the Spokane Tribe under the terms of this \nlegislation. The legislation reserves a perpetual right, power, and \neasement over the land transferred to carry out the Columbia Basin \nProject under the Columbia Basin Project Act, 16 U.S.C. 835 et seq.\n  The United States has a trust responsibility to maintain and protect \nthe integrity of all tribal lands with its borders. When Federal \nactions physically or economically impact or harm, our Nation has a \nlegal responsibility to address and compensate the damaged parties. \nUnfortunately, despite countless effort, half a century has passed \nwithout justice to the Spokane people.\n  In hearings before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on October \n2, 2003, Robert A. Robinson, Managing Director, Natural Resources and \nEnvironment, General Accounting Office testified:\n\n       A reasonable case can be made to settle the Spokane Tribe's \n     case along the lines of the Colville settlement--a one-time \n     payment from the U.S. Treasury for past lost payments for \n     water power values and annual payments primarily from \n     Bonneville [BPA]. Bonneville continues to earn revenues from \n     the Spokane reservation lands used to generate hydropower. \n     However, unlike the Colville Tribes, the Spokane Tribe does \n     not benefit from these revenues. The Spokane Tribe does not \n     benefit because it missed its filing opportunity before the \n     Indian Claims Commission. At that time it was pursuing other \n     avenues to win payments for the value of its land for \n     hydropower. These efforts would ultimately fail. Without \n     congressional action, it seems unlikely that a settlement for \n     the Spokane Tribe will occur.\n\n  The time has come for the Federal Government to finally meet its \nfiduciary responsibility for converting the Spokane Tribe's resource to \nits own benefit. Senators Inouye, Murray and I believe that the \nlegislation we are proposing today will finally bring a fair and \nhonorable closure to these matters. We are pleased that similar \nbipartisan legislation was also introduced today in the U.S House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I look forward to working with the Indian Affairs Committee and \nSenate colleagues as this legislation proceeds through the Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Wyden, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Feingold, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 882. A bill to designate certain Federal land in the State of Utah \nas wilderness, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce America's Red \nRock Wilderness Act of 2005. This legislation continues our Nation's \ncommitment to preserve our natural heritage. Preservation of our \nNation's vital natural resources will be one of our most important \nlegacies.\n  Unfortunately, remaining wilderness areas are increasingly threatened \nand degraded by oil and gas development, mining, claims of rights of \nway, logging and off-road vehicles. America's Red Rock Wilderness Act \nwill designate 9.5 million acres of land managed by the Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, in Utah as wilderness under the Wilderness Act. \nWilderness designation will preserve the land's wilderness character, \nalong with the values associated with that wilderness; scenic beauty, \nsolitude, wildlife, geological features, archaeological sites, and \nother features of scientific, educational and historical value.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act will provide wilderness protection \nfor red rock cliffs offering spectacular vistas of rare rock \nformations, canyons and desert lands, important archaeological sites, \nand habitat for rare plant and animal species.\n  Volunteers have taken inventories of thousands of square miles of BLM \nland in Utah to help determine which lands should be protected. These \nvolunteers provided extensive documentation to ensure that these areas \nmeet Federal wilderness criteria. The BLM also completed a reinventory \nof approximately 6 million acres of Federal land in the same area. The \nresults provide a convincing confirmation that the areas designated for \nprotection under this bill meet Federal wilderness criteria.\n  For more than 20 years Utah conservationists have been working to add \nthe last great blocks of undeveloped BLM-administered land in Utah to \nthe National Wilderness Preservation System. The lands proposed for \nprotection\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nsurround and connect eight of Utah's nine national park, monument and \nrecreation areas. These proposed BLM wilderness areas easily equal \ntheir neighboring national parklands in scenic beauty, opportunities \nfor recreation, and ecological importance. Yet, unlike the parks, most \nof these scenic treasures lack any form of long-term protection.\n  While my legislation would unambiguously protect Utah's red rock \nwilderness, the question of preserving these lands for future \ngenerations now also looms before the BLM. Not since the BLM conducted \nits inventories of Utah public lands in the early 1980s has the agency \nhad such a promising opportunity to recognize and care for Utah's \nwilderness. Whether the BLM realizes this opportunity has yet to be \nseen.\n  Today, nearly 6 million acres of wildlands that my legislation would \nprotect are involved in the BLM's land use planning process. As I \nunderstand, the BLM will be making lasting decisions about what places \nshould be preserved or developed, roaded or left unroaded, or \ndesignated for off-road vehicle travel. These policies will stand for \nas much as 15 to 20 years, a timespan long enough to leave a lasting \nmark on this landscape.\n  We must be clear about the impact of these plans. Fundamentally, the \nadministration is choosing how it will act as stewards for our wild and \nscenic places. These plans in Utah will profoundly influence many \nfragile desert lands that would be protected under America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act. Places like the San Rafael Swell, the Book Cliffs, the \nCanyonlands Basin, and Moab/La Sal Region now hang in the balance.\n  I believe Americans understand the need for wise and balanced \nstewardship of these wild landscapes. Unfortunately, the administration \nhas proposed little or no serious protections for Utah's most majestic \nplaces. Instead, the BLM appears to lack a solid conservation ethic and \nroutinely favors development and consumptive uses of our wild public \nland.\n  The administration has a decidedly different approach on the fate of \nsome of our remaining wilderness. Under the Price plan, the BLM leaves \n98 percent of the region's lands in America's Red Rock Wilderness Act, \noutside of already protected areas, open to oil and gas drilling. \nSadly, the Green River, which cuts deep into the rugged Book Cliffs \nforming the sandstone cliffs of Desolation Canyon, and other natural \nwonders are being jeopardized by the BLM for a negligible amount of \noil.\n  The BLM has made important headway in protecting America's Red Rock \nWilderness from off-road vehicle abuse, but more can still be done to \nsafely and effectively plan for off-road vehicle recreation. Just 5 \nyears ago, 94 percent of BLM public land in Utah lacked protection from \nmotorized vehicle abuse. As open BLM areas, many fragile lands in \nAmerica's Red Rock Wilderness Act and elsewhere were vulnerable to off-\nroad vehicle abuse. Since this free-for-all era, BLM trail designations \nhave helped to educate motorized users and direct use to appropriate \nareas. Stewardship over the long-term is still needed to ensure that \nour wilderness legacy remains intact.\n  America's Red Rock Wilderness Act is a lasting gift to the American \npublic. By protecting this serene yet wild land we are giving future \ngenerations the opportunity to enjoy the same untrammeled landscape \nthat so many now cherish.\n  I'd like to thank all of my colleagues who are original cosponsors of \nthis measure this year, many of whom have supported the bill since it \nwas first introduced. The original cosponsors of the measure are \nSenators Stabenow, Wyden, Feingold, Lautenberg, Bayh, Leahy, Lieberman, \nBoxer, Kennedy, Reed, Clinton, Corzine and Kerry. Additionally, I would \nlike to thank The Utah Wilderness Coalition, which includes The \nWilderness Society and Sierra Club; The Southern Utah Wilderness \nAlliance; and all of the other national, regional and local, hard-\nworking groups who, for years, have championed this legislation.\n  Theodore Roosevelt once stated:\n\n       The Nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources \n     as assets which it must turn over to the next generation \n     increased and not impaired in value.\n\n  Enactment of this legislation will help us realize Roosevelt's \nvision. In order to protect these precious resources in Utah for future \ngenerations, I urge my colleagues to support America's Red Rock \nWilderness Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to again join the \nsenior Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, as an original co-sponsor of \nlegislation to designate more than one million acres of Bureau of Land \nManagement, BLM, lands in Utah as wilderness.\n  I had an opportunity to travel twice to Utah. I viewed firsthand some \nof the lands that would be designated for wilderness under Senator \nDurbin's bill. I was able to view most of the proposed wilderness areas \nfrom the air, and was able to enhance my understanding through hikes \noutside the Zion National Park on the Dry Creek Bench wilderness unit \ncontained in this proposal and inside the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument to Upper Calf Creek Falls. I also viewed the lands \nproposed for designation in this bill from a river trip down the \nColorado River, and in the San Rafael Swell with members of the Emery \nCounty government.\n  I support this legislation for a number of reasons, but most of all \nbecause I have personally seen what is at stake, and I know the \nmarvelous resources that Wisconsinites and all Americans own in the BLM \nlands of Southern Utah.\n  Second, I support this legislation because I believe it sets the \nbroadest and boldest mark for the lands that should be protected in \nSouthern Utah. I believe that when the Senate considers wilderness \nlegislation it ought to know, as a benchmark, the full measure of those \nlands which are deserving of wilderness protection. This bill \nencompasses all the BLM lands of wilderness quality in Utah. \nUnfortunately, the Senate has not always had the benefit of considering \nwilderness designations for all of the deserving lands in Southern \nUtah. During the 104th Congress, I joined with the former Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Bradley, in opposing that Congress's Omnibus Parks \nlegislation. It contained provisions, which were eventually removed, \nthat many in my home state of Wisconsin believed not only designated as \nwilderness too little of the Bureau of Land Management's holding in \nUtah deserving of such protection, but also substantively changed the \nprotections afforded designated lands under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n  The lands of Southern Utah are very special to the people of \nWisconsin. In writing to me over the last few years, my constituents \nhave described these lands as places of solitude, special family \nmoments, and incredible beauty. In December 1997, Ron Raunikar of \nMadison, Wisconsin's Capital Times wrote:\n\n       Other remaining wilderness in the U.S. is at first \n     daunting, but then endearing and always a treasure for all \n     Americans. The sensually sculpted slickrock of the Colorado \n     Plateau and windswept crag lines of the Great Basin include \n     some of the last of our country's wilderness, which is not \n     fully protected.\n       We must ask our elected officials to redress this \n     circumstance, by enacting legislation which would protect \n     those national lands within the boundaries of Utah. This \n     wilderness is a treasure we can lose only once or a legacy we \n     can be forever proud to bestow to our children.\n\n  I believe that the measure being introduced today will accomplish \nthat goal. The measure protects wild lands that really are not done \njustice by any description in words. In my trip I found widely varied \nand distinct terrain, remarkable American resources of red rock cliff \nwalls, desert, canyons and gorges which encompass the canyon country of \nthe Colorado Plateau, the Mojave Desert and portions of the Great \nBasin. The lands also include mountain ranges in western Utah, and \nstark areas like the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. These \nregions appeal to all types of American outdoor interests from hikers \nand sightseers to hunters.\n  Phil Haslanger of the Capital Times, answered an important question I \nam often asked when people want to know why a Senator from Wisconsin \nwould co-sponsor legislation to protect lands in Utah. He wrote on \nSeptember 13, 1995 simply that:\n\n       ``These are not scenes that you could see in Wisconsin. \n     That's part of what makes them special.''\n\n  He continues, and adds what I think is an even more important reason \nto act to protect these lands than the landscape's uniqueness:\n\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\n\n     ``the fight over wilderness lands in Utah is a test case of \n     sorts. The anti-environmental factions in Congress are trying \n     hard to remove restrictions on development in some of the \n     nation's most splendid areas.''\n\n  Ten years later, Wisconsinites are still watching this test case. I \nbelieve that Wisconsinites view the outcome of this fight to save \nUtah's lands as a sign of where the Nation is headed with respect to \nits stewardship of natural resources. What Haslanger's comments make \nclear is that while some in Congress may express concern about creating \nnew wilderness in Utah, wilderness, as Wisconsinites know, is not \ncreated by legislation. Legislation to protect existing wilderness \nsimply ensures that future generations may have an experience on public \nlands equal to that which is available today. The action of Congress to \npreserve wild lands by extending the protections of the Wilderness Act \nof 1964 will publicly codify that expectation and promise.\n  Finally, this legislation has earned my support, and deserves the \nsupport of others in this body, because all of the acres that will be \nprotected under this bill are already public lands held in trust by the \nFederal Government for the people of the United States. Thus, while \nthey are physically located in Utah, their preservation is important to \nthe citizens of Wisconsin, as it is for other Americans.\n  I am eager to work with my colleague from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, to \nprotect these lands. I commend him for introducing this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Salazar, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 886. A bill to eliminate the annual operating deficit and \nmaintenance backlog in the national parks, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Alexander, Lieberman, Salazar, and Feinstein in introducing \nlegislation to restore and maintain our National Parks by the \ncentennial anniversary of the National Park System in 2016.\n  Heralding the establishment of the first National Parks, President \nTheodore Roosevelt stated, ``We have fallen heirs to the most glorious \nheritage a people ever received, and each one must do his part if we \nwish to show that the nation is worthy of its good fortune.''\n  And what a priceless fortune Americans enjoy--Yellowstone, the Grand \nCanyon, Yosemite, the Tetons, Mt. Rushmore, the Everglades, and \nhundreds of other extraordinary national parks that grace our country. \nHundreds of millions of families and visitors from all over the world \nhave visited these parks for recreational, educational, and cultural \nopportunities as well as the sheer pleasure of being surrounded by \ntheir natural beauty or historical significance.\n  Unfortunately, all of this public enjoyment and use coupled with the \nlack of adequate financial investment in our parks has left them in a \nstate of disrepair and neglect. A multi-billion dollar maintenance \nbacklog has cast a long shadow over the glory of our national park \nheritage. An annual operating deficit estimated at $600 million has \nfurther diminished the integrity of national park programs and \nfacilities.\n  The National Parks Centennial Act would allow all Americans to \ncontribute to the restoration of the parks through the creation of a \nCentennial Fund with monies generated by a check-off box on federal tax \nreturns. The funds collected will be directed to the priority \nmaintenance and operation needs of the national parks to make them \nfiscally sound by 2016. What better way or time to demonstrate that \n``we are worthy of the good fortune of our parks''?\n  I commend the National Parks Conservation Association for promoting \nthis sound and innovative approach to remedying the significant \ndeterioration of our parks. A companion House bill has been introduced \nby Representatives Souder and Baird with solid bipartisan support.\n  Surely this is legislation that we can all agree on and support. All \nof our lives have been enriched by our National Parks. This bill \nprovides an opportunity to show our appreciation to restore and \nmaintain our country's cultural and natural heritage for generations to \ncome. The passage of this legislation will ensure that our national \nparks will have a glorious 100th birthday to celebrate. Let's get on \nwith it!\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Today I am joining with Senators McCain, Lieberman, \nSalazar and Feinstein in introducing the National Park Centennial Act--\na bill to make the National Park System fiscally sound by its 100th \nbirthday in 2016. The park system currently suffers from a multi-\nbillion dollar backlog of maintenance projects and an operating deficit \nthat exceeds $600 million each year.\n  The Centennial Act aims to remedy this crisis by giving tax-payers \nthe opportunity to check off a box on their tax returns each year that \nwould send a small contribution to a National Park Centennial Fund. \nToday, taxpayers can contribute $3 to Presidential elections. This Act \ngives taxpayers an opportunity to contribute directly to our national \nparks via their tax returns.\n  Our parks are national treasures, and they deserve to be preserved in \nall their pristine glory. They are a part of our heritage.\n  It is a national travesty that they suffer from such a terrible lack \nof funding. The overall backlog, according to the Congressional \nResearch Service, is about $7 billion, though estimates vary by about \n$2 billion in either direction.\n  My own State, along with our neighbor North Carolina, is home to the \ncountry's most visited national park, the Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park. I live just a few miles from the park myself.\n  In Tennessee, we have tried to deal with the maintenance backlog in a \nnumber of different ways. More than 2,100 volunteers have provided over \n110,000 man-hours of service to the park, which is the equivalent of 50 \nstaff and $1.9 million in extra funding. That's the third best \nvolunteer rate in the National Park System.\n  Our local communities in Tennessee and North Carolina have \nestablished a non-profit organization to help support the park--\n``Friends of the Smokies''--which has raised more than $8 million since \nits founding in 1993 through individual, corporate and foundation \ncontributions, merchandise sales, special events, and sales of \nspecialty license plates in Tennessee and North Carolina. Friends now \nhas over 2,000 members. In addition to its fundraising activities, \nFriends of the Smokies coordinates more than 80 volunteers who provide \ndirect and indirect assistance with projects that benefit Great Smoky \nMountains National Park.\n  Yet, despite all this extra support, the backlog in the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park remains significant. The Park's current \nmaintenance backlog is estimated at approximately $180 million dollars. \nIt is estimated that the Great Smokies will receive up to $36 million \nover the next 5 years to address the maintenance backlog. There is over \na $140 million shortfall at the Great Smokies alone.\n  Examples of maintenance backlog projects at the Smokies are:\n  Rehabilitation of North Shore Cemetery access routes; rehabilitation \nof three comfort stations at Balsam Mountain; rehabilitation of three \ncomfort stations at Chimney Tops picnic area; rehabilitation of \nNewfound Gap Road, phase one; replace obsolete parkwide key system; \nrepave Clingmans Dome Trail.\n  We need to do better. It will be hard to do better in this budget \nenvironment. So this is an innovative way to help the parks do better.\n  Sixty percent of this fund will go to maintenance backlogs. Forty \npercent of this fund will supplement the annual operating deficits at \nthe parks. This program will terminate in 2016.\n  Parallel legislation has already been introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives, including Congressman Jimmy Duncan. I hope Congress \nwill move quickly to address this critical need of our national parks.\n  Our national parks are national treasures. They are a part of our \nheritage, a part of who we are as Americans. We need to take care of \nthese parks so that they are still there, in all their glory, and still \naccessible for many generations to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SALAZAR:\n  S. 888. A bill to direct the Department of Homeland Security to \nprovide guidance and training to State and local governments relating \nto sensitive homeland security information, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an important \npiece of legislation to help our local first responders and emergency \nofficials better prepare and respond to terrorist attacks.\n  State and local emergency officials represent more than 95 percent of \nAmerica's counterterrorism capability. They are on the front lines of \nthe war on terror. Despite this, there is still a fundamental \ndisconnect between what we do in Washington to help and what state and \nlocal officials actually need. Too often this happens because people in \nWashington are not listening to our folks back home.\n  One familiar example is homeland security grant funding. In the years \nfollowing 9/11, the Federal Government put more money into homeland \nsecurity than ever before. Office of Domestic Preparedness Grants \nincreased 2,900 percent from 2001 to 2003. The Federal Government acted \nquickly to get money out the door, but in too many cases, the Feds did \nnot give States the guidance they needed to best use that money. As a \nresult, State officials were left scratching their heads. Money was \nwasted and local officials did not get all the help they needed.\n  The same is true with antiterrorism intelligence. Police and fire \ndepartments across the country are being bombarded with terrorism \nintelligence from more than a dozen Federal sources. State officials \nare getting expensive Federal security clearances so that they can \nreview spy reports. But State and local officials are not getting the \nguidance they need to help them talk to each other.\n  Police, firemen, and EMTs are the first people on site during an \nemergency, whether it is a terrorist attack or car accident. Our first \nresponders must be given the information they need to safely handle any \nsituation, the training they need to protect the public and the access \nto grants to purchase the proper tools to do their jobs--this \nlegislation, if passed, will help do just that.\n  Right now, there are surprisingly few uniform standards for non-\nFederal agencies to handle sensitive homeland security information. \nWhile there are detailed procedures for handling classified documents \ncreated by the FBI, CIA and other Federal agencies, there is little \nreal world guidance for how to make decisions about how to manage \ninformation from non-Federal sources, including locally generated \nhomeland security plans, State-level grants and intelligence gathered \nby local law enforcement agencies.\n  This lack of guidance has real implications for public safety. Over \nthe last few months, Colorado's State government has been fighting over \nthe Secretary of State homeland security information. Currently, \nColorado State law makes secret a wide swath of homeland security \ninformation, including any document sent to, from, or on behalf of the \nState Office of Preparedness, Security and Fire Safety. Local officials \nhave trouble acquiring State information to help them develop \nantiterrorism plans, and even State legislators can't find out where \nhomeland security money is going.\n  State officials across the country have wasted precious resources \nbattling over what to make public and what to keep secret. They have \nestablished a wide array of procedures for sharing sensitive \ninformation among emergency management personnel. The current system of \ndistributing homeland security intelligence and grants funding is \ninefficient and has failed to ensure an adequate balance between \nprotecting sensitive information and ensuring that first responders and \nthe public have the information they need to keep Coloradans and \nAmericans safe.\n  The legislation I am introducing would take three steps to clearing \nup this confusion and giving States the tools they need to better \nprepare and respond to terrorist attacks.\n  First, it establishes detailed best practices for State and local \ngovernments to help them determine what homeland security information \nshould be made public, what should remain classified, and how different \ngovernment entities and emergency personnel can share and use sensitive \ninformation.\n  Second, it establishes a training program to spread these best \npractices among state and local officials.\n  Third, it directs the Department of Homeland Security to provide more \ndetailed instructions to State and local officials about how to manage \ninformation about homeland security grants that are applied for and \nawarded by DHS.\n  This bill will give emergency officials across the country the tools \nthey need so that they do not have to waste precious resources remaking \nthe wheel on homeland security information sharing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security \n     Information Guidance and Training Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are few uniform standards for State and local \n     government agencies to handle sensitive homeland security \n     information;\n       (2) there are detailed procedures for handling classified \n     documents created by the Federal Government, but there is \n     little guidance for how to make decisions relating to the \n     management of information from non-Federal sources, including \n     locally generated homeland security plans, State-level \n     grants, and intelligence gathered by local law enforcement \n     agencies;\n       (3) State and local government officials have--\n       (A) a wide variety of approaches for handling such \n     information;\n       (B) wasted precious resources battling over what \n     information to make public and what information to keep \n     secret; and\n       (C) established a wide array of procedures for sharing \n     sensitive information among emergency management personnel; \n     and\n       (4) the current system is inefficient and has not ensured \n     the adequate balance between protecting sensitive information \n     and ensuring that public officials and the public have the \n     information needed to keep the Nation safe.\n\n     SEC. 3. GUIDANCE FOR BEST PRACTICES RELATING TO SENSITIVE \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Consistent with section 201(d) of the \n     Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121(d)), the Under \n     Secretary of Homeland Security for Information Analysis and \n     Infrastructure Protection shall establish best practices for \n     State and local governments to assist State and local \n     governments in making determinations on--\n       (1) the types of sensitive non-Federal homeland security \n     information (including locally generated homeland security \n     plans, State-level grants, and intelligence gathered by local \n     law enforcement information agencies) that--\n       (A) should be made available to the public; or\n       (B) should be treated as information which should not be \n     made available to the public; and\n       (2) how to use and share sensitive homeland security \n     information among State and local emergency management \n     personnel.\n       (b) Effect on State and Local Governments.--Nothing under \n     subsection (a) shall be construed to--\n       (1) require any State or local government to comply with \n     any best practice established under that subsection; or\n       (2) preempt any State or local law.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRAINING.\n\n       The Director of the Office for Domestic Preparedness \n     shall--\n       (1) establish a training curriculum based on the best \n     practices established under section 3; and\n       (2) provide training to State and local governments using \n     that curriculum.\n\n     SEC. 5. GUIDANCE ON GRANT INFORMATION.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall publish in the \n     Federal Register detailed instructions for State and local \n     governments on the management of information relating to \n     homeland security grants administered by the Department of \n     Homeland Security.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \n        Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Collins, Mr. Durbin, and \n        Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 889. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require \nphased increases in the fuel efficiency standards applicable to light \ntrucks, to require fuel economy standards for automobiles up to 10,000 \npounds gross vehicle weight, to increase the fuel economy of the \nFederal fleet of vehicles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill with my \ncolleagues Senators Snowe, Corzine, Leahy, Cantwell, Collins, Durbin, \nSchumer and Jeffords to close the SUV loophole.\n  This bill would increase Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) \nstandards for SUVs and other light duty trucks. It would close the \n``SUV Loophole'' and require that SUVs meet the same fuel efficiency \nstandards as passenger cars by 2011.\n  Crude oil prices remain above $50/barrel. On April 1, 2005, crude oil \nprices hit a record high of $57.70/barrel. Prices at the gas pump \ncontinue to soar as well. Today, the average price for regular gasoline \nwas $2.24 per gallon. In California, the average price is almost $2.60.\n  This is not a problem we can drill our way out of. Global oil demand \nis rising. China imports more than 40 percent of its record 6.4 \nmillion-barrel-per-day oil demand and its consumption is growing by 7.5 \npercent per year, seven times faster than the U.S.\n  India imports approximately 70 percent of its oil, which is projected \nto rise to more than 90 percent by 2020. Their rapidly growing \neconomies are fueling their growing dependence on oil--which makes \ncontinued higher prices inevitable.\n  The most effective step we can take to reduce gas prices is to reduce \ndemand. We must use our finite fuel supplies more wisely.\n  This legislation is an important first step to limit our nation's \ndependence on oil and better protect our environment.\n  If implemented, closing the SUV Loophole would: save the U.S. 1 \nmillion barrels of oil a day and reduce our dependence on oil imports \nby 10 percent.\n  Prevent about 240 million tons of carbon dioxide--the top greenhouse \ngas and biggest single cause of global warming from entering the \natmosphere each year.\n  Save SUV and light duty truck owners hundreds of dollars each year in \ngasoline costs.\n  CAFE Standards were first established in 1975. At that time, light \ntrucks made up only a small percentage of the vehicles on the road, \nthey were used mostly for agriculture and commerce, not as passenger \ncars.\n  Today, our roads look much different, SUVs and light duty trucks \ncomprise more than half of the new car sales in the United States. As a \nresult, the overall fuel economy of our Nation's fleet is the lowest it \nhas been in two decades, because fuel economy standards for these \nvehicles are so much lower than they are for other passenger vehicles.\n  The bill we are introducing today would change that. SUVs and other \nlight duty trucks would have to meet the same fuel economy requirements \nby 2011 that passenger cars meet today.\n  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, NHTSA, has \nproposed phasing in an increase in fuel economy standards for SUVs and \nlight trucks under the following schedule: by 2005, SUVs and light \ntrucks would have to average 21.0 miles per gallon; by 2006, SUVs and \nlight trucks would have to average 21.6 miles per gallon; and by 2007, \nSUVs and light trucks would have to average 22.2 miles per gallon.\n  In 2002, the National Academy of Sciences, NAS, released a report \nstating that adequate lead time can bring about substantive increases \nin fuel economy standards. Automakers can meet higher CAFE standards if \nexisting technologies are utilized and included in new models of SUVs \nand light trucks.\n  In 2003, the head of the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration said he favored an increase in vehicle fuel economy \nstandards beyond the 1.5-mile-per-gallon hike slated to go into effect \nby 2007. ``We can do better,'' said Jeffrey Runge in an interview with \nCongressional Green Sheets. ``The overriding goal here is better fuel \neconomy to decrease our reliance on foreign oil without compromising \nsafety or American jobs,'' he said.\n  With this in mind, we have developed the following phase-in schedule \nwhich would follow up on what NHTSA has proposed for the short term and \nremain consistent with what the NAS report said is technologically \nfeasible over the next decade or so: by model year 2008, SUVs and light \nduty vehicles would have to average 23.5 miles per gallon; by model \nyear 2009, SUVs and light duty vehicles would have to average 24.8 \nmiles per gallon; by model year 2010, SUVs and light duty vehicles \nwould have to average 26.1 miles per gallon, by model year 2011, SUVs \nand light duty vehicles would have to average 27.5 miles per gallon.\n  This legislation would do two other things: it would mandate that by \n2008 the average fuel economy of the new vehicles comprising the \nFederal fleet must be 3 miles per gallon higher than the baseline \naverage fuel economy for that class. And by 2011, the average fuel \neconomy of the new federal vehicles must be 6 miles per gallon higher \nthan the baseline average fuel economy for that class.\n  The bill also increases the weight limit within which vehicles are \nbound by CAFE standards to make it harder for automotive manufacturers \nto build SUVs large enough to become exempted from CAFE standards. \nBecause SUVs are becoming larger and larger, some may become so large \nthat they will no longer qualify as even SUVs anymore.\n  We are introducing this legislation because we believe that the \nUnited States needs to take a leadership role in the fight against \nglobal warming.\n  We have already seen the potential destruction that global warming \ncan cause in the United States.\n  Snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada are shrinking and will almost entirely \ndisappear by the end of the century, devastating the source of \nCalifornia's water.\n  Eskimos are being forced inland in Alaska as their native homes on \nthe coastline are melting into the sea.\n  Glaciers are disappearing in Glacier National Park in Montana. In 100 \nyears, the park has gone from having 150 glaciers to fewer than 30. And \nthe 30 that remain are two-thirds smaller than they once were.\n  Beyond our borders, scientists are predicting how the impact of \nglobal warming will be felt around the globe.\n  It has been estimated that two-thirds of the glaciers in western \nChina will melt by 2050, seriously diminishing the water supply for the \nregion's 300 million inhabitants. Additionally, the disappearance of \nglaciers in the Andes in Peru is projected to leave the population \nwithout an adequate water supply during the summer.\n  The United States is the largest energy consumer in the world, with 4 \npercent of the world's population using 25 percent of the planet's \nenergy.\n  And much of this energy is used in cars and light trucks: 43 percent \nof the oil we use goes into our vehicles and one-third of all carbon \ndioxide emissions come from our transportation sector.\n  The U.S. is falling behind the rest of the world in the development \nof more fuel efficient automobiles. Quarterly auto sales reflect that \nconsumers are buying smaller more fuel efficient cars and sales of the \nbig, luxury vehicles that are the preferred vehicle of the American \nautomakers have dropped significantly.\n  Even SUV sales have slowed. First quarter 2005 deliveries of these \nvehicles are down compared to the same period last year--for example, \nsales of the Ford Excursion is down by 29.5 percent, the Cadillac \nEscalade by 19.9 percent, and the Toyota Sequoia by 12.6 percent.\n  On the other hand, the Toyota Prius hybrid had record sales in March \nwith a 160.9 percent increase over the previous year.\n  The struggling U.S. auto market cannot afford to fall behind in the \ndevelopment of fuel efficient vehicles. Our bill sets out a reasonable \ntime frame for car manufacturers to design vehicles that are more fuel \nefficient and that will meet the growing demand for more fuel efficient \nvehicles.\n  We can do this, and we can do this today. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 889\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Automobile Fuel Economy Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed colleague, \nSenator Feinstein as the lead cosponsor for the Feinstein-Snowe \nlegislation that will rectify an unacceptable inequity when it comes to \nobtaining greater fuel economy for the vehicles we choose to drive. \nThis bill allows us to take a road currently less traveled towards \ndecreasing our Nation's need to import greater and greater amounts of \nforeign oil from the most volatile area of the globe, and at the same \ntime, decrease polluting vehicle emissions that affect both the \npublic's and the planet's health.\n  What is clear, on the eve of Earth Day, is that the Federal \nGovernment must lead in ensuring consumers a choice of vehicles with \nhigher fuel economy, an appropriate degree of safety, and a minimal \nimpact on our environment. Closing what is called the SUV loophole that \nallows popular SUVs and other light trucks to get only 20.7 miles per \ngallon while other passenger cars need to meet a 27.5 mile per gallon \nthreshold, will help us meet these environmental, economic, and \nnational security goals, and I think it's an idea whose time has long \nsince arrived.\n  My colleague from California has been a passionate advocate of this \nproposal, and I'm proud to work with her again in introducing our \npractical, attainable bill that can garner the kind of broad support \nnecessary to address this national imperative this year. Now I know \nwhen we first introduced our plan in 2001, some believed it was too \nmuch too soon, while others felt it didn't go far enough. And around \nhere, that's usually a sign you're onto something. But can anyone \nhonestly say we're better off today without nothing? That we're in \nbetter shape because we failed to pass what is possible four years ago?\n  This legislation is a critical first step to provide real relief from \nskyrocketing gas prices that have reached over $2 a gallon all across \nthe county are estimated to stay high throughout the year. The increase \nin Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards for the light \ntrucks category--mostly SUVs and minivans--will ultimately decrease our \nneed for foreign oil. I would like to bring to my colleagues' attention \nthat every hour, $28 million leaves our country to pay for the Nation's \nunquenched thirst for foreign oil. When it comes to the fuel economy of \nAmerica's sport utility vehicles, surely we can do better for our \npocketbooks, for our planet, and for our promise for the future.\n  It is unacceptable to me that a developing country like China has put \nin place new regulations that are more stringent than U.S. CAFE \nstandards to promote better fuel. economy in their vehicles and rein in \nthat country's energy consumption. Like the U.S., China greatly depends \nupon foreign oil. However, China's GDP per capita was only \napproximately $860 in 2004 while the U.S. was at $35,000 per person. \nThe standards that go into force in China in July of 2005, require that \nall new passenger cars get two miles per gallon more than U.S. CAFE \nstandards. And SUVs will have to achieve 1.7 to 2.7 miles per gallon \nmore depending on the make. By 2008, large cars in China will have to \nget 30.4 miles per gallon. China, very aware of their rising oil \nimports, skyrocketing oil prices, and their air pollution, are finding \na way to achieve greater fuel economy, but the U.S. cannot? This makes \nabsolutely no sense to me.\n\n  Right now, all our vehicles combined consume over 40 percent of our \noil, while coughing up over 20 percent of U.S. carbon monoxide \nemissions--the greenhouse gas linked to global climate change. To put \nthis in perspective, the amount of carbon monoxide emission just from \nU.S. vehicles alone is the equivalent of the fourth highest carbon \nmonoxide emitting country in the world. Given these stunning numbers, \nhow can we continue to allow SUVs to spew three times more pollution \ninto the air than passenger cars?\n  Just think for a moment how much the world has changed \ntechnologically over the past 25 years. We've seen the advent of the \nhome computer and the information age. Computers are now running our \nautomobiles, and Global Positioning System devices are guiding drivers \nto their destinations. Are we to believe that technology couldn't have \nalso helped those drivers burn less fuel in getting there? Are we going \nto say that the whole world has transformed, but America doesn't have \nthe where-with-all to make SUVs that get better fuel economy?\n  Well, I don't believe it, and neither does the National Academy of \nSciences that issued a report in 2001 in response to Congress' request \nthe previous year that the NAS study the issue. They concluded that it \nwas possible to achieve a more than 40 percent improvement particularly \nin light truck and SUV fuel economy over a 10-15 year period--and that \ntechnologies exist now for improving fuel economy. That was 3\\1/2\\ \nyears ago.\n  I don't want America's SUV manufacturers to be ``the industry that \ntime forgot?'' and history clearly shows that the Federal Government \nmust play a role in ensuring that consumers have a choice in vehicles \nwith high degrees of fuel economy, an appropriate degree of\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\nsafety and a minimal impact on our environment. As the 2001 NAS Report \nalso stated, ``Because of the concerns about greenhouse gas emissions \nand the level of oil imports, it is appropriate for the Federal \nGovernment to ensure fuel economy levels beyond those expected to \nresult from market forces alone.'' How can we do anything less?\n  So many questions that we already have the answers to but not the \ninitiative or will to do so. Closing the SUV loophole will help us \nachieve so many goals, and it's an idea whose time has long since \narrived.\n  I ask for my colleagues' support for closing the SUV loophole, and I \nthank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/04/21/senate-section/article/S4135-1", "month": "04", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 118--RECOGNIZING JUNE 2 THROUGH JUNE 5, 2005, AS THE \n``VERMONT DAIRY FESTIVAL,'' IN HONOR OF HAROLD HOWRIGAN FOR HIS SERVICE \n            TO HIS COMMUNITY AND THE VERMONT DAIRY INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Leahy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry:\n\n                              S.
