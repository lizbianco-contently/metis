Mr. President, last week USA Today reported that the Bush \nadministration may be collecting the phone records of millions of \nAmericans. The administration's efforts to monitor activities of \nAmerican citizens appeared to be far broader than President Bush had \npreviously acknowledged.\n  Not surprisingly, Democratic and Republican Members of Congress have \nexpressed concerns about this report and indicated they have sought \nmore information about this program. Several Members made it clear that \nGeneral Hayden would be required to answer questions about this program \nas part of his confirmation process.\n  Late yesterday, the Senate was informed that the administration \nagreed to brief all members of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the \nPresident's authorization of NSA warrantless surveillance programs, \nincluding clarifying whether the reports in USA Today are accurate. \nThis new overture to the Senate on one aspect of the administration's \noverall efforts is a welcome development. I hope this action has more \nto do with a newfound interest to keep Congress fully informed than \nabout its concerns regarding their nomination for CIA Director. I am \nsurprised it has taken so long, and so much tugging and pulling, to get \nthe administration to at least this point. It is, quite simply, \nrequired by law under the National Security Act of 1947 and by the \nSenate's own rules. So it really is about time.\n  Chairman Roberts approached me on the floor yesterday to tell me \nabout these new developments. The Senator from Kansas and I have had \nour differences and will continue to have those differences over the \nconduct of the Intelligence Committee's investigation of the \nadministration's misuse of intelligence on Iraq. Senator Roberts and I \nspent many good years together as the chairman and vice chairman, back \nand forth--whatever the leadership was in the Senate--on the Ethics \nCommittee. We had a good relationship. That is going to override all \nthe negativity we have had on this Intelligence Committee stonewalling \nwe have had.\n  In the instance about this NSA wiretapping, I appreciate Chairman \nRoberts' acknowledgment that the Senate needs more information on these \nprograms and the role the President has played in this. I appreciate \nvery much the work by the Chairman and the hard work by Vice Chairman \nRockefeller to step forward to allow all members of the Intelligence \nCommittee to know what is going on or attempt to get to know what is \ngoing on. It is important\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\nfor everyone in this Chamber and for the administration to recognize \nthat this briefing on this single issue is very necessary but not \nsufficient for the American people to have confidence that their \nGovernment is not only protecting them from terrorists but also \nrespecting their constitutional rights.\n  Clearly, Senators need to know a lot more about the domestic \nsurveillance program, and I hope today's briefing accomplishes that \nobjective. But just as clearly, Senators need to know a lot more about \nother important issues: misuse of intelligence, selective leaking, \ndamage to the CIA.\n  I hope the administration's offer yesterday is the first of their \nefforts to inform Congress, not the last.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may we proceed with the final argument on \nKyl-Cornyn?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4027\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is pending. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, it looks like we are beginning to make \nsome progress. About 4 weeks ago, this amendment was introduced in its \noriginal form, and unfortunately debate was derailed. We were \nunsuccessful in moving on for further amendments and debate. \nFortunately, it looks as if things have gotten back on track. We are \nstarting to see votes and debate on amendments. I don't necessarily \nlike the way all of the votes are turning out, but this is the Senate \nand majority rules and I accept that.\n  All of us who are interested in comprehensive immigration reform want \nto see this bill continue to move, to have amendments laid down, \ndebated, and have them voted on. I am very pleased that it appears that \nwe are very close to having, if not unanimous agreement, at least \nmajority support on a bipartisan basis for the amendment that Senator \nKyl and I laid down about a month ago and which has now been modified \nslightly to bring more people on board.\n  This amendment, quite simply, is designed to make sure that convicted \nfelons and people who have committed at least three misdemeanors do not \nget the benefit of the legalization track contained in the underlying \nbill, whatever it may be. There will be other amendments later on that \nperhaps won't share the same sort of bipartisan and majority support. \nBut this one at least seems to have gathered a solid group of Senators \nto support it.\n  In addition to convicted felons, those who have committed at least \nthree misdemeanors would not be given the benefit of earned \nlegalization under the bill. It would also exclude absconders. By that, \nI mean people who have actually had their day in court and have been \nordered deported from the country but have simply gone underground, \nhunkered down in the hope they might be able to stay.\n  There have been some motions made regarding this amendment for waiver \nby the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security for \nextraordinary circumstances. For example, if someone is able to \nestablish that they didn't actually get notified, then as a matter of \nfundamental due process considerations they ought to be able to revisit \nthat and to show that they did not get notice of the removal \nproceedings. We agreed that would be a fair basis to waive this \nprovision.\n  Finally, it also appears that the other basis for waiver would be if \nthe alien's failure to appear was due to exceptional circumstances \nbeyond the control of the alien--a very narrow exception; and, finally, \nif the alien's departure from the United States would result in extreme \nhardship to the alien's spouse, parent, or child who is a citizen of \nthe United States or an alien lawfully permitted to have permanent \nstatus.\n  We move it in the right direction. It is a fundamentally fair and \ncommonsense amendment. I am pleased to support it and announce what \nappears to be a growing consensus that it should be accepted.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nArizona may need.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, I would \nlike to point out that we spent the better part of yesterday \nnegotiating with Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn, along with Senator \nKennedy and others, a group of us. We have been trying to modify the \noriginal Kyl-Cornyn amendment so that it would be broadly acceptable. I \nthink we have succeeded, thanks to the goodwill of all parties \nconcerned.\n  Fundamentally, the purpose, which we are all in agreement with, is we \ndon't want people who are convicted felons or criminals guilty of \ncrimes to be eligible for citizenship in this country. We have enough \nproblems without opening up that avenue. Yet, at the same time, we \ndidn't want to go too far to exclude people from eligibility for \ncitizenship who, frankly, may have committed incidental crimes or the \ncrime was associated with their attempt to enter this country.\n  For example, in order to obtain asylum, when people flee oppressive \nand repressive regimes in which their lives are at risk, and they had \nto use a bogus or counterfeit document in order to expedite their \nentrance into this country, of course, we don't think that should make \nthem ineligible for citizenship or application for citizenship.\n  I think we have reached a careful balance. There are categories of \npeople under conditions of extreme hardship or danger who are seeking \nasylum and would be exempted, but at the same time the thrust of the \nKyl-Cornyn amendment, which is the prevention of people who have \ncommitted felonies and numbers of misdemeanors and other crimes would \nnot be eligible for a path to citizenship as outlined in the \nlegislation that would apply to the others who have not committed \ncrimes.\n  I am aware there is some concern about this on both sides of this \nissue. I want to assure everyone that this is the product of a long, \narduous series of negotiations and discussions among all involved in \nthis issue.\n  I hope there is an understanding that we have come up with what most \nof us think is a reasonable compromise to address very legitimate \nconcerns on both sides. People who are fleeing oppression may have used \na bogus document, and on the other side of the coin, obviously, someone \nwho has committed\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\nserious crimes or a series of misdemeanors we would not want to have \nthem eligible for citizenship.\n  I thank Senators Kyl, Cornyn, Kennedy, and others who have actively \nnegotiated and come up with what we agree is a reasonable compromise.\n  By the way, that is the trademark of the progress of this \nlegislation. That gives me optimism that we will be able to \nsuccessfully conclude it in a reasonable period of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nSouth Carolina needs.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like for a moment to showcase the \nstaff of all Senators involved who have been working for hours to try \nto get this right. It is important to get this right. For me, this is \nsort of the model for where we go from here as a Nation and how we \naddress immigration issues. Senator Kennedy and his staff have been \nterrific.\n  The goal, as Senator McCain said, was to make sure that our country \nis assimilating people who potentially add value to our country. If you \nare a thug, if you are a crook, if you are a murderer or a rapist or a \nbunco artist or a felon, you don't really add any value, and the only \nperson you can blame is yourself. So I have no sympathy for your cause \nbecause your misconduct, your mean, hateful, cheating behavior has \ndisqualified you--and too bad. You don't add value.\n  With three misdemeanors, as defined in the bill and as we have it \nunder Kyl-Cornyn, you have had one chance, two chances, and the third \ntime you are out. You have nobody to blame but yourself.\n  I think every Democrat and every Republican should come to grips with \nthe idea that when we give people a second chance--whatever you want to \ncall this process we are about to engage upon--there are certain people \nwho do not get that second chance based upon what they did, either once \nor three times.\n  I think that is a good addition to this bill. It expands the base \nbill, and Kyl-Cornyn has done a good service to the body in that \nregard. But there is another side of this story. It is a group of \npeople who haven't committed crimes other than violating immigration \nlaws--nonviolent crimes or who, as Senator McCain said, is one step \nahead of a death squad in some bad part of the world and have come here \nto start a new life.\n  On the civil side, there is a group that split--the absconders. If \nyou have been given an immigration deportation order and you just \nignore it, then you are not subject to being eligible either because \nyou have had your day in court. You lose and there is no use retrying \nyour case.\n  However, if you fall into a category of people who had no knowledge \nor notice of the order for deportation, then it is not fair to hold you \naccountable to comply with something you didn't know about. So we are \ngoing to look at that case anew.\n  Within that population of people who have been issued deportation \norders, some of the people we are talking about come to our country one \nstep ahead of death squads or repressive governments. A humanitarian \nargument could be made in a few cases that we are going to listen to. \nFor that small group of people, we will have a waiver requirement. We \nwill waive the ineligibility if to deport you would reenforce a system \nthat would have led to a tragedy.\n  If you had not gotten into the program using fraudulent documents--if \nI had to choose between my family's demise or forging a document to get \naway from a oppressive government, I would forge the document. I am \nwilling to give those folks a chance to make the case that they add \nvalue.\n  On the humanitarian side, if you have a child or a member of a family \nwho is an American citizen and you receive a deportation order, I am \nwilling to allow a case to be made that it is not in the best interests \nof this country or justice to break up that family. There is a limited \nclass of cases. That is just as important to me as dealing with the \ncriminal because if you can't deal with hard cases that have some a \nsympathetic element, then you have hardened your heart as a body.\n  I don't mind telling a criminal: Too bad, you have nobody to blame \nbut yourself. But I am proud of the body listening to people who \ndeserve to be listened to and creating a waiver process that will bring \nabout a just result and to allow people to add value to the country if \nthey can prove they can.\n  Senator Kyl and Senator Cornyn have been great to work with. I hope \nwe get nearly 100 votes. I say to Senator Kennedy's staff, it would not \nhave been possible without you.\n  This body should be proud of this product because you break people \ninto groups because of what they did in their individual circumstances. \nTo me, that has been part of immigration reform. One size does not fit \nall.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senators Kennedy, Kyl, and Cornyn, \nas well as Senator McCain and those who are responsible for putting \nthis together.\n  This is a dramatic improvement over the original version of this \namendment.\n  I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from South \nCarolina. I think of these laws and amendments in human terms that we \ndeal with every day in our Senate offices. Almost 80 percent of all of \nthe case work requests for help that we receive in my offices in \nIllinois relate to immigration. Every day, we have new situations and \nnew family challenges that we are forced to confront. Some of them are \nheartbreaking.\n  I think specifically of the Benitez family in Chicago. Mr. Benitez is \nan American citizen. He works hard. He has lived in this country for \nmany years. He is a wonderful man. I see him in downtown Chicago \nregularly when I am going around. It is always good to see such a fine \nman who has worked so hard and who really believes in his family. His \nwife came to this country on a visa, overstayed the visa, married him, \nand continued to live in the United States undocumented. They have four \nchildren. Mr. Benitez and his four children are all American citizens.\n\n  The mother of his undocumented wife died in Mexico. She went back to \nMexico to the funeral of her mother. When she came back into the \ncountry, she was stopped at the border. Because of that, she has had an \noutstanding order of deportation. She made it back to the United States \nin an undocumented status with an outstanding order for deportation.\n  Is it justice in this case that this woman would somehow be deported \nfrom the United States at this moment if her husband and four children, \nall American citizens, are living here? They are good people, working \nhard, paying their taxes, speaking English, doing everything we ask of \nthem. That is not fair.\n  We have added in this amendment an opportunity for Mrs. Benitez to \nappeal for a humanitarian waiver for family circumstances. The language \nof this amendment bears repeating so the intent is clear. We give to \nthose aliens who would be subject to deportation an opportunity to \npetition in cases of extreme hardship if the alien spouse, parent, or \nchild is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted \nfor permanent residence.\n  We have created a family unification, humanitarian waiver, \nnonreviewable, but at least it gives Mrs. Benitez and people like her a \nchance to say: Let me keep my family together. Let me stay in the \nUnited States. Give me a chance to become legal.\n  That is sensible. That makes good sense. I am glad Senators Cornyn \nand Kyl have agreed to this and we have come together. There are some \npeople who will not be protected, those subject to orders of \ndeportation who are currently single and do not have any relatives \nwithin the United States who would qualify under these provisions. This \nmay not apply to them. But certainly for the family circumstance I just \ndescribed, this humanitarian waiver is on all fours. This affects these \nfamilies in a very positive way and gives them the chance they have \nbeen praying for for so long.\n  I commend Senator Kennedy and all who brought this together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will note that only 3 minutes \nremain. There was 15 minutes per side, and the time remaining is 3 \nminutes on the Democratic side.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, would the Senator from Texas yield me a \ncouple of minutes on his time?\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, just so the membership has a good understanding of \nwhere we are, I will summarize this provision. I thank Senator Cornyn \nand Senator Kyl for working with us, and Senator Graham and Senator \nMcCain for their great help and assistance, and my wonderful assistant, \nEsther, for all of her good work. Senator Durbin has illustrated the \nhuman terms which are involved in this issue as well.\n  Let me very quickly point out what the language provides. People \nshould understand now what the sense of this whole proposal is about. \nWe want to keep those who can harm us, the criminal element, out of the \nUnited States or for the consideration of being able to adjust status \nand be able to continue to work and live here. Those who can benefit \nthe United States ought to be able to remain.\n  This is what we were attempting to do with this particular language. \nThat is more complicated than it might seem.\n  Effectively, the Kyl-Cornyn amendment would make the various classes \nof aliens ineligible for the earned legalization program: Any person \nwho is issued a removal order, failed to deport, or deported and \nsubsequently returned; any person who was ordered to leave the country \nunder the visa waiver program is subject to expedited removal; any \nperson who fails to depart under a voluntary departure agreement; any \nperson convicted of a serious crime inside or outside the United \nStates; any person who has been convicted of a felony, or three \nmisdemeanors.\n  That is the operative aspect of the amendment. The compromise reached \nyesterday strengthens the waiver so that aliens under the final orders \nof removal will still be eligible for earned legalization if they did \nnot receive a notice of their immigration hearing, obviously, through \nno fault of their own--we know what the agency itself has missed, as \nthe GAO report indicated--or it is established they failed to appear at \ntheir hearing because of exceptional circumstances, which are certainly \nunderstandable; or, three, that they can establish extreme hardship to \ntheir spouse or child or parent who was a U.S. citizen or a lawful \npermanent resident. Senator Durbin gave the excellent examples of that \nprovision. Those are the kinds of examples we are all familiar with in \nthe Senate.\n  The waivers are available to immigrants who entered without \ninspection or those who fell out of status or who used false documents \nbut not to criminal aliens or aggregated felons. We believe the waiver \nwill cover many of the current undocumented who otherwise would be \nexcluded under the original Kyl-Cornyn amendment.\n  We believe it is important progress. It is not the way, certainly, \nsome Members would have drafted this proposal, but we understand the \nconcerns that have been expressed by the proponents. We believe this is \nlanguage which will for all intents and purposes treat individuals \nfairly, welcome those who should be welcome and exclude those who \nshould be excluded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent Senator Landrieu be added as a \ncosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will take a moment, before we vote to again \nthank the folks I thanked last night: Senator Kennedy; Senator McCain; \nmy colleague, Senator Cornyn, who worked on this amendment for a long \ntime; and Senator Lindsey Graham, among others, for working together to \narrive at a consensus on how this amendment should be drafted, to \nachieve the things the Senator from Massachusetts was just talking \nabout.\n  We all agree on the significant benefits that can result from \nlegislation of this kind, including, potentially, citizenship, for a \nlot of people. It should be limited to those who came here and \notherwise worked honestly in this country, and it should never be \navailable to those who have deliberately abused our laws, our process, \nor been convicted of serious crimes. As a result of this amendment, it \nwill make certain that benefits of the legislation, however they are \nultimately defined, are not available to that class of people we do not \nwant to count as fellow citizens when this is all over with.\n  I hope my colleagues will join in voting yes on the amendment. I \nthank my colleagues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Kyl opened debate on this amendment \nlast night by noting that when an earlier version of this amendment was \noffered a few weeks ago to S. 2454, it was a ``somewhat different'' \namendment. I understand and appreciate this understatement, but I also \nappreciate that Senator Kyl and his lead cosponsor Senator, Cornyn, \nwere willing to compromise and make improvements to their original \ntext.\n  I wish to express my appreciation to the Democratic leader, Senator \nReid. He was right to insist that the original version of the Kyl-\nCornyn amendment--a much broader version that some Senators wanted to \nadopt almost immediately when it was introduced a few weeks ago--\ndeserved review and should not be rushed through the Senate to score \npolitical points. He was right, as the latest version of the amendment \nattests. In addition, in the immigration debate prior to the April \nrecess, Senator Durbin recognized and described several drafting flaws \nin the original amendment that would have swept in hundreds of \nthousands of immigrants, perhaps unintentionally. With a little time, \nand thanks to a lot of hard work, the amendment has been significantly \nchanged, narrowed, and improved.\n  Among the modifications, the amendment now includes a waiver of its \nprovisions. It allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive \ncertain conditions of ineligibility to participate in the earned \nlegalization program in title VI of the bill. A negative impact on \nfamily members, or humanitarian concerns such as harsh conditions in \nthe immigrant's home country, should allow participation in the earned \nlegalization program. An alien's failure to obey an order of \ndeportation may be based upon the alien's trepidation over leaving \nbehind his U.S. citizen children. An immigrant may have had to use \nfalse documents to gain entry into the U.S., such as the case of an \nasylum seeker who is fleeing persecution.\n  There is a humane way to treat otherwise law-abiding immigrants. This \nis consistent with American values. I wish that the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment could be modified further so that its exclusions were more \nspecifically focused on criminals. That is what we have done in our \nbill and in underlying law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Senator Thune be \nadded as an original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, we yield back the time on both sides, if \nSenator Kennedy is amenable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We yield back the balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Texas yielding back all \ntime?\n  Mr. CORNYN. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 0, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 125 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 4027) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, under our sequencing, we are about to go \nto the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions. We are trying to get time agreements. Senator Sessions \nbelieves this is a very complex and important matter, which I agree \nthat it is, so I propound a unanimous consent request for 3 hours \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, could I, just for a moment, ask the \nleader to withhold the request and see if I can clear this with the \nleadership here? Could you withhold the request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do withhold the request. In the \ninterim, while Senator Kennedy is reviewing the matter, we can start \nthe debate with Senator Sessions and look forward to counting the time, \nwhich we start now, on Senator Sessions' ultimate hour and a half, if \nwe may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, perhaps as we go forward, we can finish \nup in less time than that. Maybe our colleagues on the other side will \nyield back some time. I think this is an amendment that we need to talk \nabout in some significant way. This amendment deals with barriers at \nthe border. I think this is something for which there is a growing \nappreciation, and it is not in the bill today.\n  Before I go into that, let me say to my colleagues and those who may \nbe listening that we need to spend yet more time with this legislation. \nIt is a 614-page bill. Few of our Senators have had the opportunity to \nstudy it or to understand in any significant degree the breadth of it. \nThere are things in it that absolutely do not represent good policy and \nneed to be reconsidered. I hope our colleagues will do that.\n  The vote last night on the Bingaman amendment was a very important \none. It took the maximum number of people who could enter our country \nunder the so-called guest worker provisions from around 130 million \nover 20 years, at a maximum, down far below that to probably 9 million. \nThat is in only one provision of the bill. However, I remind my \ncolleagues that while that was one of the most egregious provisions in \nthis entire legislation, this legislation still calls for massive \nincreases of legal immigration into our country, even with that change \nwe effected last night.\n  My staff worked hard on this, and I don't think anybody has even \nconsidered the numbers until the last week or the last few days. That \nanalysis concludes that as the bill is now written----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may interrupt the Senator from \nAlabama to propound a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will yield if I can reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set a 3-\nhour time limit, with an hour and a half under the control of Senator \nSessions, 45 minutes under the control of Senator Kennedy, and 45 \nminutes under my control, with the time of the vote to be determined by \nthe leaders. I do not anticipate a 1:30 vote, which would be \ninconvenient. We will respect Senator Reid's position of taking the \namendments one at a time and not setting them aside. But we can do that \nconsistent with stacking the votes until later in the afternoon.\n  Starting this morning, it was hard to get all of the people in, and \nwe started the vote a little earlier than anticipated. So we did not \nmaintain our time structure on the first vote. But we are going to \ninsist on observing the rule of 15 minutes and 5 minutes over, or if \nvotes are stacked, 10 minutes and 5 minutes over, to see if we can move \nthe bill along. So I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I add to that agreement no second-degree \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3979\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3979.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     Santorum, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. \n     Bunning, proposes an amendment numbered 3979.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To increase the amount of fencing and improve vehicle \n  barriers installed along the southwest border of the United States)\n\n       Strike section 106, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 106. CONSTRUCTION OF STRATEGIC BORDER FENCING AND \n                   VEHICLE BARRIERS.\n\n       (a) Tucson Sector.--The Secretary shall--\n       (1) replace all aged, deteriorating, or damaged primary \n     fencing in the Tucson Sector located proximate to population \n     centers in Douglas, Nogales, Naco, and Lukeville, Arizona \n     with double- or triple-layered fencing running parallel to \n     the international border between the United States and \n     Mexico;\n       (2) extend the double- or triple-layered fencing for a \n     distance of not less than 2 miles beyond urban areas, except \n     that the double- or triple-layered fence shall extend west of \n     Naco, Arizona, for a distance of 10 miles; and\n       (3) construct not less than 150 miles of vehicle barriers \n     and all-weather roads in the Tucson Sector running parallel \n     to the international border between the United States and \n     Mexico in areas that are known transit points for illegal \n     cross-border traffic.\n       (b) Yuma Sector.--The Secretary shall--\n       (1) replace all aged, deteriorating, or damaged primary \n     fencing in the Yuma Sector located proximate to population \n     centers in Yuma, Somerton, and San Luis, Arizona with double- \n     or triple-layered fencing running parallel to the \n     international border between the United States and Mexico;\n       (2) extend the double- or triple-layered fencing for a \n     distance of not less than 2 miles beyond urban areas in the \n     Yuma Sector; and\n       (3) construct not less than 50 miles of vehicle barriers \n     and all-weather roads in the Yuma Sector running parallel to \n     the international border between the United States and Mexico \n     in areas that are known transit points for illegal cross-\n     border traffic.\n       (c) Other High Trafficked Areas.--The Secretary shall \n     construct not less than 370 miles of triple-layered fencing \n     which may include portions already constructed in San Diego \n     Tucson and Yuma sectors and 500 miles of vehicle barriers in \n     other areas along the southwest border that the Secretary \n     determines are areas that are most often used by smugglers \n     and illegal aliens attempting to gain illegal entry into the \n     United States.\n       (d) Construction Deadline.--The Secretary shall immediately \n     commence construction of the fencing, barriers, and roads \n     described in subsections (a), (b), and (c) and shall complete \n     such construction not later than 2 years after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the \n     Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives \n     that describes the progress that has been made in \n     constructing the fencing, barriers, and roads described in \n     subsections (a), (b), and (c).\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\n     sums as may be necessary to carry out this section.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \ncolleagues, Senator Santorum, Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Vitter, and \nSenator Bunning be made original cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, my colleagues need to know that we \nstill, after the positive step we took last night, are looking at \nincreasing immigration into our country by a significant amount. Those \ntotals will range, depending on how it plays out, from a minimum of 63 \nmillion to 93 million. That is 3 to 5 times the current number we now \nallow, and would expect to allow, over 20 years, which is 19 million \npeople allowed to come into our country legally. This would raise that \nnumber to between 63 million and 93 million. It is better than where we \nwere yesterday, but I still submit that it is a number that has not \nbeen carefully thought out. We have not analyzed how to do this with a \nnumber that is still too great, in my opinion.\n  We hear over and over that this is a guest worker proposal, it is a \nguest worker plan. There is nothing ``guest'' about it. Every person \nwho comes in under this legislation, as it is now written, as it is now \non the floor of the Senate, will be able to enter for a significant \nperiod of time. They will be able to apply for a green card shortly \nthereafter. That means you are a legal, permanent resident. After 5 \nyears, you can apply for citizenship. So this is not temporary.\n  As President Bush mentioned yesterday several times--a temporary \nworker program--it is not temporary. It is a permanent move for people \nto enter our country to become citizens, and that is a matter far more \nsignificant than some have suggested to us. I think it is important for \nus to all know that. Please, we need to know that. Anybody who says \n``temporary worker'' in discussions with the media or on the floor of \nthe Senate ought to have their hand spanked a little bit.\n  Next, the legislation continues and accelerates an emphasis on low-\nskilled workers. All of the economists that we have heard testify in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee--and we have not had a lot--agreed that \nlow-skilled workers tend to be a net drain on the economy and utilize \nmore in Government benefits, welfare, and health care than high-skilled \nworkers. Any program that we pass ought to emphasize high-skilled \nworkers. This bill doesn't do that. This bill does nothing about the \nchain migration in which people who work their way to citizenship can \nbring in their parents, their brothers and sisters, adult children, \nregardless of the needs of the United States for workers, regardless of \nwhat skills they may have and whether we need them in the United \nStates. Under this bill, citizenship is an automatic right. That ought \nto be confronted. The economists and public policy experts we have \nheard from raise that point and say other countries are not that way.\n  So this is the Senate. We are supposed to be the thoughtful branch. \nThis is one of the most important issues this Senate has faced in \ndecades. The people of the United States really care about this. They \nare concerned about it. They want us to do the right thing. That will \ninclude creating a legal system that is enforceable and will increase \nthe number of legal immigrants into our country.\n  But how will we do it? Will we do it in a principled way that is \nhelpful to our Nation's future or will we continue to willy-nilly \nprovide, in effect, entitlements to people from all over the world to \ncome here regardless of the needs of the United States?\n  Some say: We just need to pass something. Don't be nitpicky, \nSessions, just pass something. We will get it to conference and somehow \nit will be fixed there.\n  I have my doubts about that, No. 1. No. 2, this is the Senate. We \nwill be casting votes on this legislation, and we ought not vote for \nanything that we know is not good public policy.\n  A critical part of the immigration reform that we need to effect for \nour country is to make sure that our legal system, which is so utterly \nbroken on this issue, is repaired. It needs to work. Can anyone dispute \nthat? Today, we understand that 1 million people come into the country \nlegally each year. The estimates are that 500,000 to 800,000 will be \ncoming in illegally each year--almost as many legal immigrants.\n  I see Senator Vitter in the Chair, who is such a knowledgeable and \narticulate spokesman on this issue. I happened to see the mayor's \ndebate in New Orleans last night, and Hard Ball asked them what about \nillegal immigrants? They had to have them to do the work in New \nOrleans. There was a discussion about it. What is the answer to that? \nOf course, you don't need illegal immigrants to do the work. Of course, \nif we craft a good immigration bill, when you have a crisis like \nHurricane Katrina, we would be able to have temporary workers come in \nin whatever numbers are necessary to do that work. That is what a good \nbill would do.\n  That is a crisis that calls for an unusual amount of workers. Why \ndon't we draft something that would actually work in that circumstance? \nNot anybody, no one, should come in and justify illegality. If the law \nis not adequate, let's fix it. The truth is, I think it is adequate \ntoday.\n  A critical part of moving us to an effective, enforceable, honorable, \ndecent, legal immigration system is to send the message to the world \nthat our border is not open, our border is closed. There are a number \nof ways to do that. I think that is important because we need to reach \na tipping point where the people who want to come to our country know \nwithout doubt that coming here illegally is not going to be successful, \nand their best way to come here is to file the proper application and \nwait in line. Isn't that the right policy?\n  So how do we go from this lawless system, a system that makes a \nmockery of the laws of this great Nation, the United States of America, \nto a system that works? We send some signals and we do some things \nappropriately. President Bush did one of them the night before last \nwhen he said we were going to use the National Guard. That is a signal \nto the world that business as usual has ended, that we are going to \ncreate a legal system that works. We want him to follow through on that \nand with all of the other requirements that go with it. But it is a \ngood step and a good signal, and it will help us improve that system.\n  Another way is to have more Border Patrol agents. We need that. We \nhave authorized some more in this bill but not enough. It is a matter \nof critical importance, and we will need to fund that--the Senate and \nHouse--and not just to authorize it. Isn't that an essential part of it \nif we are going to change from a lawless system to a lawful system?\n  Another thing that we absolutely need, and every expert knows, is to \nincrease the retention space. We have to end the catch and release. \nWhen you catch someone who comes into this country through Mexico or \nCanada from a country that is other than Mexico or Canada, where they \nare not contiguous to the United States, how do you get them home?\n  How do you return them? You have to put them on a boat or train or \nplane, and that is not always easy to do. So do you know what has been \nhappening, friends and neighbors? They catch them around the border, \nand they are released on bail and asked to come back at a certain time \nso they can be taken out of the country. How many do you think show up \nto be deported? They violated the law to come here, so we release them \non bail and ask them to show up so they can be deported. How laughable \nis that? One reporter did an analysis in one area of this system, and \n95 percent did not show up. Surprise, surprise. Why do we release them? \nWhy do we not hold them until they can be deported? Because we don't \nhave sufficient bed space.\n  Part of reaching a tipping point in creating a legal system is to \nmake sure we don't eviscerate the work of our law enforcement agents by \nhaving them turn loose the people they just went out in the desert to \ncatch. How simple is that? But it is critical, and it is not there yet. \nSo people who say they want a stronger border have to support, in my \nview, more detention spaces.\n  This amendment also deals with a critical component of creating a \nlegal system that works, and that is fencing. It sends a signal that \nopen border days are over, and it will greatly enhance\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\nenforcement. It will pay for itself many times over the years. It is a \nreasonable proposal. It does not overreach. It builds on the provisions \nthat are in the bill.\n  Senator Kyl in committee had a number of provisions dealing with \nArizona and fencing along that border. It builds on those provisions \nand keeps that language in the bill but provides and directs that we \nhave 370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of barriers sufficient to keep \nvehicles from crossing the border. We are at a point where we need to \ntake this step if we are serious.\n  The bill before us today, S. 2611, is the fundamental base bill from \nwhich we are working. Its language calls for repair and construction of \nadditional fencing in very limited areas along the southern border, \nmostly in Arizona, as I just mentioned. But for the most part, this \nprovision simply calls for the repair of fences that already exist in \nthe Tucson and Yuma sections of Arizona.\n  Other than this limited amount of fencing, provisions contained in \ntitle I of this bill call only for the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security to develop a comprehensive plan for the systematic \nsurveillance of the border, and section 129 calls for only a study to \nassess the necessity, feasibility, and economic impact of constructing \nphysical barriers along the border. Just a study.\n  This amendment attempts to go forward and create a real solution to \nthe problem. It directs that the Secretary of Homeland Security \nconstruct at least 370 miles of triple-layered fencing, including the \nfencing already built in San Diego, and 500 miles of vehicle barriers \nat strategic locations along the southwest border.\n  These are not extreme numbers in any way. In fact, they are the \nnumbers given to a number of Senators in a briefing a few weeks ago by \nSecretary Chertoff himself, President Bush's Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. He said this is what he believes at this point in time he \nneeds. It directs that this be done. It sends a signal to our \nappropriators that it should be funded, and it authorizes the President \nand the executive branch to go further than this and build such other \nfences as they may find appropriate.\n  We will have objections for reasons I am not sure why, but I suspect \nwe will have objections. One of the points I have been making for some \ntime when it comes to fixing our immigration system is that we have \nquite a number of Members of the House and Senate and members in the \nmedia who are all in favor of reforms and improvements as long as they \ndon't really work. If it really makes a difference and will actually \ntilt the system from one that is illegal and will change the status quo \nand move us to a legal system, somehow, someway, there will be \nobjections to it.\n  I submit that we are going to have objections to this modest proposal \nto build 370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of barriers according to \nthe request of the Secretary of Homeland Security because it is going \nto work. That is why. We will have a lot of other reasons, such as it \nmight send a bad signal. But good fences make good neighbors. Fences \ndon't make bad neighbors. Go to the San Diego border and talk with the \npeople. There was lawlessness, drug dealing, gangs, and economic \ndepression on both sides of the border. When they built the fence and \nbrought that border under control, the economy on both sides of the \nfence blossomed, crime has fallen, and it is an entirely different \nplace and a much better place. That is just the way it is. We have to \ndo this, and it is time to move forward.\n  A state-of-the-art border security system should be robust enough \nthat it would not be easily compromised by cutting, climbing, \ntunneling, or ramming through with a vehicle, when combined with high-\ntech detection devices, motion sensors, body sensors, and seismic or \nsubterranean sensors. A good barrier should make intrusion time \nconsuming enough that a border unit could respond to the attempted \nintrusion before they are successful. That is what a fence does. To be \nworth our efforts, it does not need to be 100 percent impenetrable; it \nsimply needs to improve significantly the status quo, and I am \nconfident this amendment will do that.\n  Mr. President, it is great to see my colleague, Senator Ben Nelson, \nin the Chamber. He is dealing with a number of important issues today, \nbut he has understood the importance of security at the border from the \nbeginning. He has articulated clearly and effectively his vision for \nthat and has recognized that unless we demonstrate to the world and to \nour own people that we have border security done first, then nothing \nelse is going to be meaningful, and we will be right back where we were \nin the beginning.\n  I know Senator Nelson has to leave, and I am pleased to yield to him \nsuch time as we have remaining to speak on this amendment. I have been \npleased to work with him on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the \nSenator from Alabama, for his incredible work on this border-security-\nfirst issue and his work on this particular amendment. It is a pleasure \nfor me to join with him to support securing our borders.\n  Senator Sessions has made a very strong argument as to why we need to \nsecure the border first to pursue this whole question of how do we deal \nwith border security and with the immigration issues of those who are \nalready here illegally.\n  The key is to prevent not only illegal pedestrian and vehicular \ntraffic crossing the international border of the United States for \npeople coming here to work, but it also includes a great concern, a \ngrowing concern about the number of people who are smuggling drugs into \nthe United States, as well as those who are crossing the border for \nother illegal purposes, such as gang membership in communities across \nthis country.\n  We have a multisituation with which we have to deal, but it is all \nhandled in the same way in terms of securing the border first. Whether \nit is to prevent illegal people coming for purposes of work or whether \nit is for other purposes, most of which would be criminal in nature, we \nneed to secure that border.\n  I never thought I would be proposing a security system that would \ninclude a border fence and a surveillance system that would protect our \nborders to the south or requiring a border study for the northern \nborder as well. But I never expected that we would end up with the \nproblem we have today.\n  If we go back to 1986 when the first amnesty bill was dealt with and \nPresident Reagan signed it and promised that the U.S. Government would \ncontinue to enforce border security, we had between 1 and 2 million \npeople in the United States illegally. Of course, that was, by \ncomparison to the 11 to 12 million today, a much smaller number, \nobviously, but a much smaller problem in terms of the numbers to deal \nwith.\n  Today, the problem has continued to worsen, and as a result of the \ndebate in the Senate and without action to secure the borders first \nfrom 3 weeks to 4 weeks ago, the number of border crossings is \nincreasing percentagewise. The numbers continue to increase because \nthere is an expectation that when they get here, somehow the U.S. \nGovernment, Congress, will find a way to bless it, find a way to excuse \nit, find a way to accept it, find a way to make it legal, and \neverything will be OK. That is because we haven't taken the opportunity \nto secure our borders first. Then, when we have those borders secured \nwith this fence, with this barrier against pedestrian and vehicular \ntraffic, we will be in a position to deal with the 11 to 12 million \npeople in this country illegally and find solutions through a \ncomprehensive approach.\n  My colleague has made it very clear and I believe it is very obvious \nthat if we continue to pursue a multiapproach in the Senate, as opposed \nto border security, and try to solve all the problems with a do-\neverything bill, that if this bill then passes and goes to conference, \nit will be easier to square a circle than it will be to square the \nSenate bill with the House bill. I am not going to excuse the dealings \nwe have with the people already here, but if we can't put the proper \norder in place, we are not going to be able to solve this problem. I \nbelieve that is a given.\n  When I first announced my border security bill last fall along with \nSenator Sessions and Senator Coburn, people across the country were \ntalking about\n\n[[Page S4654]]\n\nsecuring our borders, but there wasn't any action. The truth is, that \nwas last fall, and here we are in the spring, and there is still no \naction, people are still coming across the border in significant \nnumbers. We must, in fact, focus on how to deal with this problem in a \ncommonsense and effective way.\n  Sometimes it is great to talk about a comprehensive approach, and \nsometimes it makes a great deal of sense to talk about what might be \ninvolved in a comprehensive approach, but when we don't have a \ncomprehensive approach on the House side--and we have to, through \nconference, be able to make the Senate bill work with the House \nversion. We have to be practical and recognize that these are two, in \nmany ways, diametrically opposed approaches and there is no real way to \nsquare them.\n  I believe we ought to take the approach that makes the most sense, \nand that is to pass a border-security-first bill, adopt this amendment, \nand continue to work toward securing the borders so that once we get \nthat done, we can get a bill to the House, to conference, and we can \nget that accomplished, and then we can spend the time necessary to \nfigure out how we square the problems in the United States today with \npeople who are here illegally. Before we jump to conclusions that will \nenable others to come here legally or illegally, let us figure out what \nthe needs of the United States might be for workers before we decide to \nallow people to come on their own initiative, whether they fit the \nneeds that exist for workers in the United States at the present time \nor the future.\n  We don't have to be mean-spirited dealing with this issue. We don't \nhave to be divisive among one another to solve this problem. What we \nhave to do is apply some common sense as to what is going to work and \nhow we can get that accomplished. If we do that, then we can sit down \nand work our way through the other problem we have of the President's \npoints 1 and 2 in terms of border security. We can figure out a way, if \nwe are going to close the back door to illegal immigration, to open the \nfront door to legal immigration, whether it is through guest workers or \nemergency situations where we have emergency needs that would require \nworkers to come in on a guest-worker basis. We can resolve those \nissues. We can resolve that. What we cannot do is we cannot resolve all \nof this at the same time in one package effectively and get anything \ndone.\n\n  I am an optimist on most occasions, but I have to tell you that I am \nvery concerned what will happen is that the Senate will pass this \ncomprehensive, do-everything version of a bill, and then it will go to \nconference and nothing will happen. Actually, nothing will happen on \nthe legislation because it won't be able to be squared with the House \nversion.\n  But let me tell you what will happen. If we don't have that border \nsecured sufficiently, there will be an influx of more illegal \nimmigrants coming to get here while they can, while nothing occurs on \nthe legislation. That is unacceptable to the American people. The \nAmerican people want to secure the borders. They want to find a \ncomprehensive solution. But they know it doesn't make any sense for the \nproblem to get bigger in terms of the numbers while nothing happens on \nour legislation once it is passed by the Senate and goes to the \nconference committee.\n  I wish it were different. I wish I could say all we have to do is \npass a good version in the Senate and send it over to the House and \nsomehow the whole process will work and everybody will come together \nand we will have a bill and then it will all be taken care of and we \ncan all say: Well, we have solved that problem. It just doesn't work \nthat way here. We all know that.\n  Why don't we admit the practicality of where we are and resolve the \nborder security first, and then we can begin the very laborious and the \nnecessary task of working with the people who are here and do it in an \nappropriate fashion, rather than rushing our way through with one \namendment after another amendment after another amendment, and see at \nthe end of the day what we have? When you make a pie a slice at a time, \nit isn't necessarily a comprehensive approach.\n  I appreciate and I thank my good friend from Alabama for the \nopportunity to speak on this issue today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire wanted to \nspeak on a different subject, and I believe he has cleared that, and it \nwould not count against the time on this amendment. I would be pleased, \nif there is no objection, to allow him to speak on that subject now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to claim the \nfloor afterward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 20 \nminutes and the time not be charged to this amendment and that Senator \nSessions be recognized upon completion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to talk about border security. \nObviously it is a topic of hot discussion here in the Chamber, and I \njust wanted to try to put in perspective what has actually happened and \nwhat may happen, especially in light of the President's presentation on \nMonday night.\n  I have the good fortune, I guess, to chair the appropriations \nsubcommittee which has responsibility for border security. I took this \nover 2 years ago, a year and a half ago, I guess. When I took the \ncommittee over, it became immediately apparent to me that the \npriorities within the Department of Homeland Security were not \nnecessarily focused on what I consider to be the primary threat. So we \nreoriented the funding within the Department to look at threat first, \nthe highest level threat being, of course, a weapon of mass destruction \nwhich might be used against America. So we started to increase funding \nimmediately in that account.\n  In my opinion, the second highest level of threat was the fact that \nour borders were simply not secure. They were porous. We didn't know \nwho was coming in. We especially didn't know who was leaving. We knew \nthat we weren't in control of the southern border relative to those \nfolks coming in, and we knew that on the northern border, although we \ndon't have the human-wave issue of illegal immigrants coming into the \ncountry, we do have a very serious issue of people who might come \nacross the northern border represent clear and present threats to us, \nprobably even more so than across the southern borders, in some cases. \nSo we reoriented funding within the homeland security programs through \nthe first bill that I was in charge of.\n  At that time, the administration sent up a proposal which essentially \ncontinued what I would call the benign neglect of the border security \neffort in our country. Their proposal in that budget was for 210 \nadditional border agents and essentially no increase in technical \ncapability or in the capacity of infrastructure or the capacity of ICE. \nThere was a proposal in the Coast Guard area, but it was anemic. So we \ntook that proposal which came from the administration and we reoriented \nthat, too. We said: We are going to increase the number of border \nsecurity agents on the border by 8,000. We are going to spend about 4 \nyears to 5 years doing that. We had to begin slowly because the \ntraining facilities simply weren't there for this type of a huge \nincrease in border security staff. So we began with a supplemental \nnumber of 500, and then we followed that up with 1,000 additional \nagents in the next regular bill that came through. So we added 1,500 \nnew agents.\n\n  In addition, agents aren't the only issue. Boots on the ground is not \nthe only issue. Technology is an issue, but probably even more \nimportant is the issue of what you do with an illegal immigrant who has \ncome across our border once you capture that individual on our side of \nthe border. Most of them are Mexican, on the southern border--about 85 \npercent--and they are immediately put on a bus and taken back across \nthe border. In many instances, they just come back the next day or a \nweek later. But a number of them are non-Mexicans, and those folks were \ngiven what was called a catch-and-release status, where you essentially\n\n[[Page S4655]]\n\ngave them an indictment which said they must return to be heard in a \nhearing 2 or 3 weeks later, maybe a month later, and then you released \nthese individuals. Of course most of them never come back. Sixty-six \npercent never return to that hearing. That wasn't working, so we \nbelieved we should significantly increase the number of detention beds \nso we would have the capacity to actually hold people, especially non-\nMexicans, who were coming across our border and whom we couldn't \nimmediately return by bus to their country, as we could with the \nMexicans. So we started to expand the number of beds, and we increased \nthe number of beds by about I think 2,000 in that first budget cycle.\n  After having done that, it was ironic, and I guess appropriate, that \nthe White House came forward and said: What a great idea. That is our \nidea. Let's take credit for this idea. So they held a press conference \nand said: What a wonderful idea you had to increase the number of \nborder agents by 1,500 people and the number of beds by a couple \nthousand, and we would actually be taking the money and putting it \ntoward border security. That was a year ago.\n  Now the new budget came up again, and this time the administration \nsent up a budget which was oriented toward border security in that they \nrepresented that they were going to increase the number of agents by \nanother 1,500 and the number of beds by another 6,000, and they were \ngoing to begin to put more money into the Coast Guard initiative called \ndeepwater. But it is not really deepwater; it would be better called \nprotecting our coastline from threat. ``Deepwater'' makes people think \nit is somewhere out in the middle of the ocean. It may occur in the \nocean, but actually this is threat protection along our coast.\n  So they made these commitments within the budget they sent up. What \nthey failed to do, however, was fund those commitments because they \nsent up really a hollow budget in that they put in that budget a system \nfor paying for these new Border Patrol agents and these new beds by \nincreasing the fees on people who are traveling on airplanes by about \n$1.2 billion. Of course, that fee proposal had been rejected the year \nbefore. The Chairman of the committee that has jurisdiction over that \nproposal had rejected it out of hand this year when that budget was \nsent up, and everybody knows that it is not going anywhere, so it is \nwhat is called a plug. It happens around here. People send up a budget, \nand they will put a plug in it, which is basically a number they know \nthey are never going to get, but they put it in to make the budget look \ncorrect. This was a plug. Clearly, airline fees, if they are going to \nbe increased, that revenue should go toward airline traffic protection, \nwhich is basically TSA activity, maybe some visa activity, but it is \nnot appropriate to put an increase on the airline passenger, on people \nusing the airlines, and then take that revenue and put it on the \nborder. If you want to use a fee on the border, put a fee on the \nborder. Put a 50-cent charge as if you are going through a toll gate. \nIf people want to come across the border, maybe it should cost people \n75 cents.\n  But in any event, that wasn't proposed. What was proposed was to \nraise the airline fee, which everybody knew was not going to be done. \nIt was a plug number. So even though they sent up a budget number to \nincrease the Border Patrol agents by 1,500 and the beds by about 6,000, \nas a practical matter, it would be very hard for us to do that with the \nnumbers they sent up to back up those commitments, but at least the \ncommitment was there.\n  As the chairman of that appropriations subcommittee, it put me in a \nvery difficult position because basically I have to go out and find \nthat $1.2 billion to fill that hole, to get the additional funding to \nget those agents, which we wanted to do or had intended to do. That \nmeans I have to convince the Chairman of the committee, Senator \nCochran, to take money from some other subcommittee in order to do that \nwithin the confines of the budget--obviously a challenge to Senator \nCochran and clearly a position he shouldn't have been put in, but he \nhas been, as have I.\n  Now, because of the fact that, as we looked hard at the border patrol \nissue and the securing of the border issue, it became very apparent \nthat not only were boots on the ground an issue but actual physical \ncapital assets were a huge issue--for example, the planes that are \nflown by the Customs Department, the Customs agents, are 30 to 40 years \nold and 20 years past their useful life. The helicopters being flown by \nthe Border Patrol agents are 20 years past their useful life. The Coast \nGuard has a fleet which is very aged and which is not fast. They have \none or two planes that are up to snuff, but most of their planes need \nto be refurbished. In addition, the unmanned technological activity \nalong the border, specifically unmanned aerial vehicles--there was one, \nbut regrettably it crashed 3 weeks ago. That has been discussed a lot \non this floor. So there are actually none right now, and there won't be \na new one until August. In fact, the surveillance fleet is so bad that \nabout a month ago, the entire fleet was grounded, so we had no planes \nin the air.\n\n  Then you have the vehicle issue. These vehicles wear out very quickly \nbecause they are used very aggressively in very difficult terrain. Then \nyou have the issue of just simply the training facilities because as \nyou dramatically expand the number of people you are trying to put in \nthe Border Patrol, you need training facilities to do that. Those \ntraining facilities are being upgraded and have been upgraded, but they \nneed to be upgraded further to handle the even more people we are going \nto put in there.\n  So I suggested about a year and a half ago that we do a capital \ninfusion into the border security effort which would essentially \naccelerate the Coast Guard refurbishment, taking it from completion in \nthe year 2026, which I thought was a little long to wait for the Coast \nGuard to be refurbished, down to 2016. It would get the new planes for \nthe Customs Agency; get new helicopters for the Border Patrol; and \ninstead of having one Predator, which no longer exists, in the air on \nthe border, have three or four Predators on the border. There are other \ntechnologies which are a lot cheaper, actually, than using that vehicle \nwhich probably should be pursued, and doing the technology along the \nborder relative to land-to-land detection.\n  In addition, the capital infusion would give the Border Patrol the \nphysical facilities so that when we get all of these Border Patrol \nagents together in their various facilities, they have a place to sit \ndown, they also have desks at which to work, and they have vehicles \nthat allow them to go out in the field and do their job.\n  To accomplish that kind of refurbishment was in, our estimation, \nabout a $1.9 billion effort. So I initially put that forward in the \nDefense bill last year. It got knocked out. It went in on the Senate \nfloor, went to conference, and it got knocked out. I then put it in the \nreconciliation bill, and it got knocked out. I then put it in, with the \nsupport of the Senate--the strong support of the Senate--actually \nSenator Byrd has been a pleasure to work with as the ranking member on \nthis subcommittee. I then put it into the most recent supplemental that \ncame across the floor, $1.9 billion for capital activity. Well, then we \nhad a presentation by the President on Monday night which suggested we \nbring in the National Guard to basically, I guess, as I understand it, \nfree up Border Patrol agents from desk jobs and get them out in the \nfield--to simplify the statement of what they will be doing, although \nthey will be doing more than that, I am sure--essentially is funded by \ntaking the $1.9 billion and moving it from capital refurbishment over \nto operational exercises. That, in my opinion, is not necessarily--\nwell, I will let people assess where that is.\n\n  In any event, it would mean the capital initiative would no longer \nexist and the dollars would go to pay for the National Guard and for \nother activities that are operational in nature, including adding an \nadditional 1,000 Border Patrol agents on top of the 1,500, which we did \nplan to add this year. This would be good if we could actually \naccomplish that. However, there are technical restrictions on the \nability to hire--it takes about 35,000 applications to get 1,000 \nagents--and the capacity to train is extremely limited. It is limited, \nnot extremely limited--but it is limited so you probably can't do 2,500 \nagents in the timeframe this proposal has put forward. Maybe you can. I\n\n[[Page S4656]]\n\ndoubt it. The track record of this department in this area is not \nstellar.\n  Essentially what is happening is that $1.9 billion which was supposed \nto go to capital improvements to get the planes, so they could fly the \nhelicopters, fly the predators--so they could be up in the air, and the \nvehicle so they can drive around the border doesn't exist anymore. I \nwas told by the Chairman of the conference yesterday: Good luck in \ngetting this money. If you want to break the President's hard number of \n$94 billion and claim it as an emergency, you can get the money and get \nit that way.\n  Of course, as the Chairman of the Budget Committee, when I put this \nproposal forward I hadn't actually paid for it, and that was the key. I \ntook it out of the across-the-board cut from defense. It was not my \nfirst choice on how to pay for it, but at the request of Senators \nStevens and Warner, I did that. But, obviously, I am not going to put \nforward a proposal that exceeds the $94 billion and is unpaid for and \nthere is no way to pay for it from the money paid to the Defense \nDepartment in this supplemental as an add-on to the initial $1.9 \nbillion. We need, obviously, $3.8 billion at that point. So this \ncapital improvement exercise is essentially dead as a result of the \nmoney being moved, migrated over to the operations side relative to the \nNational Guard.\n  The practical effect of that also will be that the out-year pressure \non the budget, on the appropriations account relative to this account, \nwill be significantly higher because we will be putting in place a \nbudget item essentially paying for the National Guard, or the people \nwho replace the National Guard, which will be at least $1.9 billion in \ncosts annually on top of the present appropriated plan. So to do it \ncorrectly we should not only use this $1.9 billion for this operational \nactivity, but there should have been a supplemental request for the \nbudget of the homeland security agency, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, to reflect what you might call the expense that is going to \nbe generated by the ongoing cost of putting this type of initiative in \nthe field, if you are going to be sure that initiative will continue \nand will be robust.\n  I would be very much in support of that, obviously, because clearly \nthat number is going to have to be paid for. As I mentioned earlier in \nthis discussion, I already have a $1.2 billion hole in that budget \nwhich I have to pay for in order to get the full 1,500 complement in \nplace of additional agents. Now I will have a $1.2 billion hole plus a \n$1.9 billion hole on the operational side. And in addition, of course, \nI will have a $1.9 billion hole on the capital expenditure side because \nwe still have these airplanes that have to be replaced, helicopters \nthat have to be replaced, unmanned vehicles that have to be put in the \nair, and a Coast Guard that really should not have to wait until 2026 \nto adequately defend our coastline.\n  I want to outline the specifics of where we are now on the dollars \nrelative to border patrol and border security. When you get down to it, \nthis is not a complex issue, securing our border. We all know that with \n8,000 more agents, about 10,000 more detention beds, with decent \ntechnology on the border relative to unmanned vehicles and sensors, \nwith a Coast Guard that is up to snuff, with airplanes that are up to \nsnuff, we can essentially control the border to the extent you can \ncontrol it without a guest worker program in place. A guest worker \nprogram still, in my opinion, is critical to any long-term resolution \nof this program because human nature says people are going to cross the \nborder if they are getting paid $5 in Mexico and $50 in the United \nStates for a day's labor and they have a family to support. So that is \nan element of it.\n  But the first element to which I think everybody has agreed is decent \nborder security. Decent border security only requires resources. We \nhave the capacity to do it; we have the technology to do it. It would \nbe nice if the Defense Department would share a little more \naggressively with Homeland Security, or Homeland Security would, on the \nother hand, go out more actively to try to get the Defense Department \nto share it, but we have all the parts sitting there in the box. What \nwe have to do is pay the price of taking them out of the box and \nputting them in the places they should be.\n  I just wanted to outline where we stand relative to the issue of \nresources because I think there has been considerable confusion, \nespecially in light of the speech by the President on Monday.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Of course, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have before us now an amendment in terms of building \nsome 350 miles of additional fence. It is going to be a triple fence. \nThe best estimates--the Senate, I am sure, will hear from the Senator \nfrom Alabama--but the best estimates we have been able to see is \napproximately $4 billion.\n  I am just listening to the Senator talk about allocating resources to \nrenew technology between border guards, between helicopters, unmanned \naerial vehicles, other infrastructure improvements, and the pressure \nthat we are under in terms of the appropriations. Having listened to \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, and listened to how he had to allocate \n$1.9 billion, is he prepared to make any comment if we add another \nauthorization for another $4 billion or $5 billion on fencing, where \nthat money would be available?\n  Mr. GREGG. In response to the Senator from Massachusetts, neither he \nnor Senator Sessions is going to like my response. I come down on the \nmiddle on this one. We can have, in that capital allocation, money for \na fence. I believe additional fencing is important, especially in the \nurban areas where the crossing points are basically stepping across a \nstreet corner, and you have to put up significant fencing to accomplish \nthat. I honestly don't know the number of miles. But clearly there is \ngoing to be a significant cost. I am of the view that we ought to \nlisten to the department as to what the number is relative to the miles \nof fence that is needed. I would very much oppose a fence that ran the \nwhole length of the border. I think that would be a waste of money, it \nwould be inappropriate, and it would be extremely inhospitable to \nMexico.\n\n  But there are areas of the country that the only way you can do it is \nby fence. Certainly, the San Diego fence proved to us that fences do \nwork in urban areas. What the distances should be and what the numbers \nshould be, I don't know the answer to that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator could yield for another question? Could \nthe Senator have 3 more minutes to just yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I must say I agree with the Senator--we will have a \nchance, when I have my own time, to talk about Secretary Chertoff--that \nthere are appropriate areas. I agree with the Senator as well. But just \nextending a fence all along the border does not make sense. I think his \nresponse is certainly one with which I agree, and I thank him for his \ncomments.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator and yield the floor and appreciate the \ncourtesy of the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor allowing me to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nbecause it is very important that we have, as the chairman of our \nBudget Committee, someone who can add and someone who has a memory. We \nforget how things happen around here, and Senator Gregg has a way of \nreminding us of how we get in these fixes. It is very valuable to us.\n  I would respond to my colleague from Massachusetts that $4 billion to \n$5 billion is an estimate for the fence across the entire 1,980 miles \nof border. This amendment calls for 370 miles, some of which has \nalready been built. It is called for by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity. It does, indeed, focus mostly on urban areas, and it gives \nhim great flexibility in deciding where to put it.\n  Does it cost some money? Yes. But I want to tell every Member of our \nSenate community that the American people expect this. If it takes a \nsequester\n\n[[Page S4657]]\n\nacross the board and takes a half of 1 percent of every budget to get \nthis thing done and fix immigration, that is what they want us to do.\n  I am delighted that Senator Vitter of Louisiana is here and also \nwants to speak on this issue. He is an original cosponsor.\n  I would also note, and add for the Record, that Senator Graham, our \nPresiding Officer, and Senator Inhofe wish to be original cosponsors, \nas does Senator Kyl from Arizona. I ask that be part of the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield such time as Senator Vitter uses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this \namendment. First, let me congratulate my colleague from Alabama for \nputting together this very essential amendment. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor, and I want to strongly support it.\n  I also want to suggest that based on the discussion we just heard \ninvolving the chairman of the Budget Committee and the Senator from \nMassachusetts, everyone in this Chamber, based on their statements, \nshould support this amendment. Based on what the Senator from \nMassachusetts just said, he should embrace this amendment because, if \nyou look at the details of what this amendment does, it is perfectly \nconsistent with those statements, and it is perfectly consistent with \nwhat the President said on Monday night. It is utterly consistent with \nwhat Secretary Chertoff says he wants and needs as a crucial element of \nborder security. It is not the only element, not the only silver \nbullet, there is no magic wand, but it is a crucial element of border \nsecurity.\n  Unfortunately, the underlying bill does not provide enough \nauthorization and demand for fencing in this regard. The underlying \nbill, particularly section 106, only calls for a very limited and \nmodest repair and construction of fencing along very limited parts of \nthe southern border of Arizona. That is basically fencing that largely \nalready exists in the Tucson and Yuma sections of Arizona.\n  What this amendment would do would be to expand that provision in a \nvery reasonable and cost-effective way. What this amendment would say \nis that the Secretary of Homeland Security would construct at least 270 \nmiles of triple-layered fence, including the miles of fence already \nbuilt in San Diego, Tucson, and Yuma, and 500 miles of vehicle barriers \nat strategic locations.\n  Again, I underscore that this is not building a wall or a fence \nacross the entire Mexican border. This is not the cost cited by the \nSenator from Massachusetts. This is something far more focused, that \nwill be a great force multiplier as we put more agents at the border, \nand that is an absolutely critical part of truly defending the border.\n  As the chairman of the Budget Committee said, in highly urban areas \nthere is simply no way around the need for a fence. To avoid a fence in \nhighly populated areas would literally require a border agent every few \nfeet to monitor the border because you are talking about a border \nrunning through the middle, essentially, of an urban neighborhood. That \nis an impossible enforcement situation without some sort of physical \nbarrier. These 370 miles would go into those highly populated areas.\n  I underscore that this is exactly consistent with what virtually \neverybody has been talking about. Monday night the President talked \nabout border security. He wasn't quite as strong on border security as \nI would have liked. He wasn't quite as focused on border security, \nfirst, before we move on to other elements of this bill, as I would \nhave liked, but he explicitly mentioned the need for significant \nfencing for those highly populated areas. This amendment simply does \nthat.\n  The President's own Secretary, Mike Chertoff, has met with Members of \nthis body, and he specifically talked about exactly the same need and \nspecifically talked about 370 miles. That is where this number in this \namendment comes from. This number didn't come from out of the blue. It \nwasn't just a wild guess. It wasn't just a pretty number. It came from \ndiscussions with Secretary Chertoff.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee, when asked by the Senator from \nMassachusetts would he support fencing, said we absolutely need it as a \npiece of our enforcement puzzle for highly populated areas--for urban \nneighborhoods.\n  That is exactly what this amendment addresses. Again, the 370 miles \nis exactly focused on that type of need--highly populated areas where \nto patrol the border without any physical structure would literally \nrequire a border agent every several feet, which is completely \nimpractical and cost prohibitive.\n  I think this is an absolutely essential amendment to the bill. \nReally, this is the sort of amendment that will test how serious folks \nreally are about enforcement.\n  This whole immigration debate is pretty interesting. We have wildly \ndivergent views and strong passions on the issue from one end of the \nspectrum to the other. Yet if you listen to speakers on this floor, no \none is in favor of amnesty and everyone is in favor of border security. \nOf course, it depends on how you define ``amnesty'' and how you define \n``border security.''\n  In terms of border security, this amendment is a simple test on \nwhether you are really serious in what you say. This is a gut check \nthat the American people can understand very simply. If border security \nmeans anything, it surely means, among many other items, this 370-mile \nfence. If a Member of the Senate votes against this really quite \nnarrowly tailored, limited in some ways, modest amendment, I think the \nAmerican people will get it. They will surely know that Member isn't \nserious in any way about border security.\n  In closing, let me thank the Senator from Alabama again for this very \nnecessary amendment. If border security is to mean anything, if it is \nto possibly work--and I have serious reservations about whether the \nplan in this underlying bill will be allowed to work, will be enforced, \nif the appropriations will happen to make it work, but if it is to have \na chance to work, surely it has to include this modest 370-mile fence, \nthe sort of fencing President Bush specifically talked about and the \nnumber of miles his Secretary of Homeland Security specifically \nmentioned in meetings with Members of this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use.\n  Over the course of the discussion and debate on immigration reform, \nthose of us who have been strong supporters of it have pointed out what \nthe President of the United States pointed out; that is, this is about \nfour major aspects of having this program work. They are all \ninterrelated. That is what we call comprehensive. One of them is border \nsecurity.\n  Those of us who support strong immigration reform strongly support \nborder security. We voted for the enhancement and the increase in the \nsupplemental.\n  We just listened to the Senator from New Hampshire who outlined how \nhe allocated $1.9 billion. It is very interesting that we have some \nallocation for a San Diego fence in that, but he also talked about \nusing new technology and using recent technological breakthroughs as \nbeing the most effective way to provide security at the border. He \nreiterated that today.\n  The chart behind me illustrates border enforcement which is in S. \n2611 at the present time: 12,000 new border agents; high-technology, \nvirtual fence which was favorably and positively commented on by the \nSenator from New Hampshire when he had responsibility to take the $1.9 \nbillion and look at how he was going to allocate it over the period of \ntime.\n  It talks about the new roads, vehicle barriers at the border, and \nabout fencing in strategic locations.\n  Do you understand fencing in strategic locations? That is a part of \nS. 2611.\n  I was at the briefing with Mr. Chertoff. I understand he was talking \nabout building a fence at strategic locations, but 400 miles of urban \narea is on the border.\n  Let us be serious--400 miles. That is almost a quarter of the \nsouthern border stretching from California to the Gulf of Mexico. And \nwe are trying to\n\n[[Page S4658]]\n\nconvince the Member from Massachusetts that is an urban area? Come on.\n  We recognize there are going to be certain strategic areas for \nfencing. That is in this bill.\n  Authorization for permanent highways in the legislation, and we are \nall familiar with that. Who can get that bumper sticker up the highest? \nLet us put up another 30,000 border guards. I dare you to vote against \nthat and I will show that you are not interested in border security. \nLet us put another 1,800 miles of fence down there and triple wiring to \nshow how tough we are on it.\n  Is that the challenge out here when we are trying to deal with a \ncomprehensive program? I don't think so.\n  What we are trying to do is do what is necessary.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire talked about the limitations in \nrecruitment. You have to get 40,000 in order to get 1,000 in terms that \nwill be qualified for border security. He talks about the limitations \nin training programs. He talks about the technological kinds of \nlimitations.\n  I thought he made a very responsible presentation.\n  If there were additional needs, we were prepared.\n  We have had the opportunity to work on this issue on border security. \nWe have also recognized that part of border security is enforcement in \nterms of those who would be coming into the United States as guest \nworkers to make sure we are not going to have exploitation. If they are \nnot going to be able to get that job which they are able to get today, \nthere will be less pressures on the border.\n\n  All of that is entirely relevant. If they have the ability to go back \nand forth, there will be less pressure on the border as well. These are \nall entirely relevant. That is the result of the extensive hearings we \nhad. These are all the items which we have included.\n  I am for Secretary Chertoff working through those particular areas. \nWith his charts and maps, he demonstrated areas where he thought it \nmade some sense to put some fencing and other areas where he thought it \nwas completely unnecessary. There is nothing in the current \nlegislation. In fact, there is sufficient authorization. So if the \nSecretary wants to use resources that are allocated to him to meet the \nresponsibility, he has the power today to do it. There is no suggestion \nthat he does not have the power and does not have the flexibility in \nterms of the budget to be able to do that today in the selected areas.\n  But the idea to effectively fence a quarter of the border on the \nsouth, that is the downpayment for fencing the whole border.\n  There are Members of this body who believe that is the way to go. Let \nus put the fence all down there. Then we are going to have guards going \nall along that. We will back that up with the National Guard.\n  I don't know whether we have enough men and women in the National \nGuard or if we are going to have a sufficient number of men and women \nin the military to do that.\n  Then we are going to look at our northern border, as the Senator from \nNew Hampshire pointed out and as we have heard in our committee. If you \nare looking at security issues, there is as much concern about the \nnorthern border as there is about the southern border--so 4,200 miles \nup there as well. It is unlimited. Let us get more border guards up \nthere. Let us get 4,200 miles of fencing up there as well.\n  We should secure our borders. To do that, you need a multidimensional \napproach. You need effective enforcement. You need enforcement in terms \nof here at home for employers that are going to bring undocumented \naliens to their companies and corporations. And you need a process \nwhich is going to be vigorous in enforcement. We provide that as well.\n  I wish to mention a couple of items in terms of the fencing we have \nseen that I think are also related. If we look at what has happened at \nthe border crossings over the last several years, let us recognize that \nwe are all committed to doing more on the border. But the idea that \nborder security in and of itself with fencing or not is going to solve \nthe problem just defies all recent history.\n  Forty-thousand came across the border 20 years ago, and 400,000 10 \nyears ago. Mr. President, $20 billion--23 times the number of border \nagents we have put on in the last 10 years, and it is probably double \nthat today. You just can't spend enough money on those. You can't get \nenough agents. You have to look beyond that. You have to look at what \nis happening here in U.S. in terms of employment and tough enforcement. \nThat is what we are about in this legislation.\n  Let me point out what this chart says. These are deaths due to \nunauthorized border crossings. You go from 1996 with 315 to 1998 with \n491. The list goes on, 391, 371, 412, 369, 443. These are the deaths \nprimarily in the desert.\n  We can ask ourselves, Why do we have a significant increase in 1997 \nto 1998? Why did it go from 129 to 325?\n  Do you know what happened during that period of time? The fence went \nup in southern California. There is 67 miles of fencing at the present \ntime.\n  In the legislation, there are key areas which have been identified as \nurban areas, and we also provide the resources for targeted areas in \nArizona.\n  That is what has happened. During the building and construction of \nthat fence, we were driving these individuals who wanted to come to the \nUnited States to take the jobs which employers offered to them--and \nthey shouldn't have offered it if we had an effective system--they had \nto travel across the great desert, they had to travel across the \nmountains at dramatically higher risk in terms of their own safety and \nin terms of their own security. The totality of the pressure for coming \nhere was not reduced and the totality of the people who got in here was \nnot reduced.\n  There was a dramatic increase in the cost of lives. That may mean \nsomething to some people and it may not mean much to others.\n  Again, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, he talked about \nthe new technology, and he talked about the unmanned aerial vehicles \nthat we need to get and bring on board. He talked about new kinds of \ntechnology, which he pointed out, and which I believe, and as the \ntestimony presents itself, is really effective in developing the \nvirtual wall, the virtual wall of technology, the virtual wall that can \nprovide the security which this Nation needs. I support that. I will \nsupport certainly the resources to be able to do it.\n  But this is a feel-good amendment. We need to do things which are \nserious and which are important in terms of the border. This doesn't \nhappen to meet that particular requirement.\n  I hope the Senate will accept it. I withhold the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the time is under the control of Senator \nSessions, who asked I take the floor next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me first of all note that I very strongly \nsupport this amendment for one reason: It embodies the entirety of an \namendment which I offered in the Senate Judiciary Committee which was \nagreed to. When the Senator from Massachusetts defends the underlying \nbill, he is defending that amendment.\n  That amendment provides for about half of what we are talking about. \nIn fact, all of the language of that amendment is also included in the \namendment of Senator Sessions. Why do I know about that? It was my \namendment because it deals specifically with the State of Arizona. What \ndid we do? We went to the Border Patrol and we said: You will have \naircraft, sensors, cameras, border patrol, vehicles, fencing, all of \nthose things working in combination to try to secure the border.\n  What do you need, specifically? What are you recommending for the \nfencing part of that? This is what they said: First of all, we need to \ntear down some of the existing fencing because it is not very \neffective. It is the old surplus landing mat. It is solid steel. It \nstood vertically. The National Guard built that fencing and that is \nwhat exists in the urban areas.\n  I wish my colleague from Massachusetts could visit the border in \nArizona and see how that solid-steel fencing has divided communities. \nIt is an ugly eyesore. It is an ineffective way to prevent people from \ncrossing, right in the middle of Nagales, AZ. On the other side from \nNaco-Sonora, separated by this fence, we have a huge 30-foot-high or\n\n[[Page S4659]]\n\n20-foot-high barrier of solid steel. It is ugly. It is ineffective. \nPeople can climb up the other side, and our Border Patrol cannot see \nthem because it is solid steel.\n  What the Border Patrol would like is a double fencing that you can \nsee through so they can see who is on the other side and what they are \nabout to do. Moreover, the biggest part of violence now is the rock \nthrowing that occurs. They cannot see what is on the other side of this \nsteel barrier.\n  The first point is they want to replace this landing mat fencing with \nmodern, up-to-date fencing that is probably double. That is to say, \nthere are two fences involved, as there are in California. That has \nbeen extraordinarily effective to keep people out because you have a \npatrolling in the middle. People may get over one fence, but by the \ntime they get over that fence the cameras spot them and are able to \ndirect Border Patrol to the area. They are not able to get over the \nsecond fence so they cannot quickly melt into the rest of our society. \nThat is why this double fencing actually works.\n  In the area of San Diego, I am told that still no one has crossed \nover the double or triple fencing. No one. In that sector of the \nborder, the apprehensions have gone down. This is good news because it \nmeans there are not people crossing--from some 600,000 now down to \n100,000. And that is the entire sector of San Diego. In the specific \narea where there are 26 miles of fencing, no one gets across. That is \nwhat we are trying to achieve in the urban areas.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts said all that has done is to drive \nthem out into the desert, where it is more dangerous and deaths have \nincreased. What is the point of that argument? Is the point that we \nshould simply provide an invitation for those who would like to cross \nour border illegally, to do it in the same way as the urban area?\n  What the Border Patrol says works is a combination of things. Fencing \nin the urban area, where large numbers of people congregate at one \ntime. We have seen the pictures of them rushing the border through the \nSan Diego port of entry, where 200 or 300 people at a time congregate, \nrush the border, rush through, intermingle with the cars waiting to get \nthrough. It is impossible to apprehend more than a handful of them. \nThat is one of the techniques.\n  We have to try to stop that. One way we do that in the urban area is \nto have this fencing. Frankly, if I can get my colleagues from New \nEngland or other States to come down, Members would agree it is not \nvery sightly. From an environmental standpoint, it is not good. And \nfrom a good neighbor standpoint, it is not good to have this ugly \nfencing. We would like something that looks good and does the job.\n  What the amendment in the underlying bill does, and it is the same \nthing in Senator Session's amendment, it says we are going to replace \nthat landing mat fencing with the kind of fencing the Border Patrol \nbelieves would be more effective. That is part of the reason for the \n370 miles of fencing.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts derided the amendment as suggesting \nthat it was not just for the urban areas because, after all, 370 miles \nof fencing is a lot of fencing. That is a big piece of the whole \nborder. Now, let's calm down and do the math. There are several hundred \ntowns along the border. As one should not argue against oneself when \none supports the underlying bill, here is what one is supporting. What \nyou are supporting is fencing in the urban areas, approximately 10 \nmiles extended in either direction. The urban areas are maybe 5 or 6 \nmiles and 2 or 3 miles beyond that. That is what the underlying bill \nprovides.\n\n  I will read briefly from parts of the underlying amendment:\n\n       (1) replace all aged, deteriorating, or damaged primary \n     fencing in the Tucson Sector located approximate to \n     population centers in Douglas, Nogales, Naco, and Lukeville, \n     Arizona with double- or triple-layered fencing running \n     parallel to the international boundary . . .\n\n  To extend it for a distance of not less than 2 miles beyond urban \nareas except it shall extend west of Naco for a distance of 10 miles. \nThen we talk about the Yuma Sector of Yuma, Somerton, and San Luis, so \nthere are 15 communities in the State of Arizona.\n  If you proximate 10 miles on either side of the midpoint of the \ncommunity, that comes out to 140 miles of fencing. If you add to that, \nthere is at least 26 miles in the San Diego area. I don't know how much \nbeyond that. If you add the 26 miles, that is 176 miles. There are many \nother communities in California, but let's say there are four or five. \nThat gets you half of the 370 miles, and you have not even talked about \nthe longest part of the border in New Mexico and Texas.\n  My point is, if all you do is extend, to a modest degree, for more \nthan 10 miles on either side of the communities that are on the border, \nyou are easily up to 326 miles of fencing.\n  Why did the Border Patrol say it needed 326 miles of fencing? Because \nthey did the math. They counted up all of the communities and figured \nhow much fencing they needed in each of these urban areas and that is \nwhat they asked for. This amendment simply takes the underlying bill, \nwhich my colleague from Massachusetts is supporting, and adds \nessentially the fencing for Texas, New Mexico, and California to that, \nand the sum total we get is about 370 miles to replace existing fencing \nand add fencing strictly in the urban areas, which will be effective as \nthe fencing in San Diego has been.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts says we need to secure the border, but \nwe should do it in a serious way. I submit that a virtual fence is not \na fence. A serious way means building some miles of actual fence. That \nis what keeps the illegal immigrants from crossing illegally into the \nUnited States. In combination with UAVs, helicopter, fixed-wing \nsurveillance--there is surveillance actually in other ways, as well, \nwhich we do not need to get into--there are sensors, there are cameras, \nthere are people on patrol on horseback, on three-wheeled vehicles, on \nfour-wheeled vehicles, and you put all of those things together, and we \ncan build a combination of actual and virtual fencing that creates the \nability to control the border. This is what you do if you are serious \nabout controlling the border.\n  Finally, in the Judiciary Committee, we held hearings about what was \nnecessary to secure the border. We heard from the head of the Border \nPatrol, David Aguilar. We heard from the former head of the Border \nPatrol, we heard from the U.S. attorney from Arizona, we heard from a \ncouple of sheriffs on the border in Texas and Arizona. And we asked \nthem what was going on at the border and what they need to control the \nborder. Here are a couple of examples. David Aguilar said that over 10 \npercent of the people now apprehended coming into the country illegally \nhad criminal records. They were serious criminal records. We are not \ntalking about defacing public property. We are talking about murder, \nrape, kidnaping, violent smuggling, drug crimes, and the like. More \nthan 10 percent. These people are deterred by fencing, and they need to \nbe stopped. So we are not talking about people trying to come into the \ncountry to work.\n  The U.S. attorney for Arizona testified that crime, in the last year, \nin terms of assaults in the border areas, has increased by 108 percent. \nThe reason is because the Border Patrol is finally getting to be a \nsufficient number, and the fencing is doing a good enough job that we \nare contesting the territory of the drug cartels, the smugglers, the \ncoyotes, and the criminals are fighting back to try to regain the \nterritory with weapons. Do not think rocks are not a lethal weapon. As \na result, we are seeing that there is some progress being made, but it \nhas increased the violence. The Border Patrol desperately needs more \nfencing in order to protect their agents from these criminals on the \nother side of the border.\n  It is beyond me why someone would deride a recommendation of the \nBorder Patrol for a little bit of fencing in the urban areas to protect \nour officers who are out there trying to do their job, among other \nthings, to prevent violent criminals from entering the United States, \nto prevent contraband drugs from entering the United States.\n  This is why we are adding a little bit of fencing. The border is \n2,000 miles, roughly, and we are talking 370 miles, representing \nessentially the area of urban communities on the border. Bear in mind, \nthese are communities that straddle the border. In Douglas, until a few \nyears ago, there was a corral in the middle of town, and the border ran\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\nthrough the middle of the corral. There was nothing but a corral. In \nplaces right outside of town, there is a barbed-wire fence that is old \nand rusty and now does not even have three strands. That is the border.\n\n  These are communities in which people work and live on both sides, \nthey cross frequently, and they are now subjected to a huge amount of \ncrime because of the elements that have moved into those communities to \ntransport drugs, to make a lot of money transporting illegal \nimmigrants, and to come across the border from countries other than \nMexico because they are criminals, and they figured out this is a good \nway to get into the United States to do their crime. Who knows what \nterrorists might be thinking.\n  The point of this amendment is to add, simply, a little bit more \nfencing to what is already in the underlying bill in the urban areas of \nthe country to effectively secure the border which, after all, is what \nwe ought to be about here, to protect the people who live in the \nvicinity of the fencing and to protect the officers we have put into \nharm's way to do the job we want them to do.\n  I will conclude with this point. It has become very fashionable now \nfor everyone to say: We must secure the border. What this amendment \nsays is, if you are serious, if you really mean that, here is a very \nmodest little thing you can do, what the Border Patrol has recommended \nit needs, to have a modest amount of real fencing which they say \nprotects themselves and protects American citizens.\n  I don't have the statistics on the top of my head, and maybe Senator \nCornyn does, but at the hearing we held in our subcommittee, the \ntestimony was that crime in the San Diego area where this fencing had \ngone up had gone way down, but that San Diego and the Mexican citizens \non the other side of the border, likewise, have been subjected to a \nhuge increase in crime until that fence was built. Once the coyotes and \nthe cartels knew they could not come across in that area, they left. \nAnd so did the crime.\n  This is a great amendment. It should be supported by all Members. \nCrime in San Diego dropped by 56.3 percent between 1989 and 2000. If \nyou can cut the crime in half in a community by building this double \nfence, and they did, and I don't hear anyone objecting to the double \nfence in the area of San Diego, why shouldn't the other communities? If \nanyone would like to come to the Senate and say that it was a mistake \nto build that double fence in the area of San Diego, I would like to \nask them to please do it. I would love to hear the reason why that is \nnot a good idea.\n  All we are asking is that in the other urban areas along the border, \nthe same kind of fencing be built to protect our law enforcement \nofficials and the citizens of those areas and to help prevent this kind \nof smuggling across our border--nothing more, nothing less. This is a \nmodest amendment, and it should be unanimously agreed to by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Arizona. There is no more \nharder working, no more knowledgeable Senator in this Senate on the \nissues involving the border than he. I thank him for his eloquent \nremarks.\n  I am pleased to yield such time as he may consume to Senator Cornyn \nof Texas who, like myself, is one of the most knowledgeable people in \nthis Senate who has been engaged in this debate from the beginning and \nwhose advice and recommendations I have valued throughout. So I will \nyield to Senator Cornyn for such time as he may choose to use.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time remains on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-eight minutes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I assure my colleagues, I will not use but \na fraction of that time.\n  I think one of the things that makes this issue of fences and walls \nalong the border so controversial is because walls and fences are \npowerful symbols. Indeed, I know, in talking to some of our friends on \nthe other side of the border, they worry what the message is America \nwould send if we were to build, let's say hypothetically, a 2,000-mile \nwall between America and Mexico.\n  Well, suffice it to say that I think, as we have had this debate both \nin the Judiciary Committee and now here on the floor of the Senate--and \nas a lot of us have been working to try to better understand what is \nactually needed by the Border Patrol to secure our borders--our \nthinking has evolved.\n  Indeed, I was one of those who initially was somewhat skeptical of \nthe idea of a wall or a fence. But now I find myself supporting this \namendment. I would like to explain just for a minute why.\n  We sometimes joke among ourselves that if, in fact, Congress was to \nauthorize and the Department of Homeland Security was to build a 2,000-\nmile wall, 50-feet high, across the border, it would probably see a \nboom in the sale of 51-foot ladders or what we would see is a lot more \nof those tunnels like we have seen in the news recently in California \nand elsewhere, people going through a tunnel.\n  We all know, if you do not go over a wall or a fence, and you do not \ngo under a fence, you might go around the sides of the fence. So I have \nwondered whether this is, in fact, the most effective way to deal with \nthe problem.\n  As I have told my colleagues, coming from a State that has 1,600 \nmiles of common border with the country of Mexico, I hope you will go \nlook at it and see what we are talking about. I fear sometimes when \npeople talk about the border they are relying more on their \nrecollection, perhaps, of a movie they have seen or a novel they have \nread. It is a tough and difficult place to deal with, and you can \nappreciate, when you go to the border, the challenges the Border Patrol \nhas and why it is so easy, relatively speaking, for people who want to \ncome across that border into the United States, notwithstanding our \nefforts to try to secure it.\n  But I do not believe we ought to seal the border. I do not believe we \nought to close the border. But I do believe we ought to secure the \nborder. And I believe now that some strategic barriers--and, yes, even \nsome fencing, such as Senator Kyl and Senator Sessions have described--\nwould be helpful.\n  Now, how did I arrive at that conclusion? Well, because we held a \nnumber of hearings. As chairman of the Immigration and Border Security \nand Citizenship Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, we have had a \nnumber of hearings, including the experts who have told us that, yes, \nit would be helpful in some areas along this 2,000-mile border to have \nsome strategic barriers, some fences, some ways to funnel traffic so \nthat the Border Patrol can have an easier job trying to actually detain \npeople who come into the country illegally.\n  I would point out that under Senator Sessions' amendment, it would \nauthorize the building of up to about 370 miles of fence. About 70 \nmiles is already in place. So really we are talking about 15 percent of \nthat 2,000-mile border which would be authorized to be built subject to \nthe good judgment and discretion and professional decisions of the \nfolks who are in charge. The Border Patrol, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, they would be the ones deciding it because, frankly, I do not \nthink we here in Washington are in any position to decide where it \nought to go. We ought to leave it to the experts.\n  But the fact is, it is expensive. This leads me again to remind my \ncolleagues that we can pass some pretty expansive legislation here, we \ncan talk in grandiose terms about border security, worksite \nverification, and dealing with this great challenge that confronts us, \nbut sooner or later we are going to have to pay for it. And the $1.9 \nbillion the Senator from New Hampshire succeeded in getting \nappropriated in the supplemental appropriations bill is a mere \ndownpayment on what it is going to cost. So I hope Senators who talk in \nvery sincere terms, no doubt, about making sure this bill is \nenforceable will be just as emphatic when it comes to paying for these \nmeasures.\n  Let me say that we are not just talking about putting up some fencing \nin order to secure our borders. We are talking about doubling the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents. This is the primary law enforcement \nagency that is responsible for providing border security. The President \nannounced on Monday night that he was going to authorize up to 6,000 \nNational Guard troops to assist the Border Patrol on a stopgap\n\n[[Page S4661]]\n\nbasis, not to perform law enforcement per se but to provide support to \nthe Border Patrol while we recruit and train more Border Patrol agents.\n\n  Now, one thing I do not understand is why we are told that the Border \nPatrol can only train 1,500 Border Patrol agents a year. We need more, \nand we need them faster. In the last 3 years, the United States and the \ncoalition partners have trained a quarter of a million Iraqi security \nofficers and police and army. Why we can train, with the assistance of \nour coalition partners, 250,000 Iraqis but we can only train 1,500 \nBorder Patrol agents a year is beyond me. We need to find out why that \nis and fix it.\n  But I sincerely believe what we need is a combination of more boots \non the ground--we need human beings. We need to roughly double the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents to about 20,000. And just by way of a \nfootnote, let me point out in New York City alone there are about \n40,000 police officers. So we are talking about half the number of law \nenforcement agents along our 2,000-mile border than they have in New \nYork City. But they need some help.\n  We need the force multiplier that comes with technology. I know \nothers have talked about this, but a couple days ago I went out to Fort \nBelvoir, VA, out to the Army's night vision lab and their sensor lab \nwhere they actually develop this technology for use by our military in \nplaces such as Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere. What they \ndemonstrated for me is some of the technology that is relatively \ninexpensive that is already being used by our military in places such \nas Afghanistan and Iraq that could be easily used by the Department of \nHomeland Security along the border. And this ranges from unmanned \naerial vehicles that are airplanes, basically, with cameras on them \nthat weigh about 10 pounds that can stay in the air for up to 4 hours \nat a time, which can also tie into ground sensors and cameras, thermal \nimagery, radar, and other things that could be used to be a force \nmultiplier for our Border Patrol.\n  I think what we need is a combination of things to provide that \nsecurity along the border. I do not favor a 2,000-mile wall, but I do \nnot see what the objection is to using the necessary tools that are \nrequired in order to provide some chance of stopping the flow of \nhumanity across our border.\n  Last year alone, 1.19 million people were detained coming across our \nsouthern border--1.1 million people. And people wonder why we have a \nproblem? People wonder why we have a problem with controlling our \nborders when we do not have enough people, we do not have the \ntechnology, we do not have the strategic barriers there?\n  Well, part of the problem is we only have about 20,000 detention \nbeds--20,000. That is the reason the Department of Homeland Security is \nengaged in this flawed idea of catch and release. In other words, you \ncatch 1.1 million people, you send people back home more or less \nimmediately who come from Mexico, a contiguous nation. But if they come \nfrom other countries, then we have to make arrangements to send folks \nback where they came from. That requires them to be detained somewhere \nfor a while.\n  With only 20,000 detention beds, and 250,000, roughly, people coming \nfrom countries other than Mexico last year alone, you can see the \nproblem. So people are released on their own recognizance and asked to \ncome back for their deportation hearing 30 days hence. And guess what. \nMost of them do not show up. It makes you kind of wonder about the ones \nwho do, knowing, as they must, that we do not have the people, the \ntechnology, and the infrastructure in place actually to enforce the \nlaw. Well, that is what we are trying to fix here.\n  So let me say, in conclusion, I think we have all evolved in our \nunderstanding of what it is going to take to solve this problem. I \nbelieve we have seen some good movement across the aisle on a \nbipartisan basis to try to come up with solutions. And I have been led \nto conclude--as a result of all the discussions and debates we have \nhad, the hearings we have had in the Judiciary Committee, listening to \nthe experts who are in a position to know--that this is what they need.\n  Secretary Chertoff of the Department of Homeland Security told a \nnumber of us this is what he needed in order to get the job done. I \nbelieve we have an obligation to give our law enforcement officials the \ntools they actually need to get it done, and to do otherwise would be \nsome sort of cruel joke, to pretend we are actually serious about \ndealing with this problem but yet failing to provide those same \nofficials the tools they need in order to get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am not opposed to fences and vehicle \nbarriers. They are included in the bill. It is our understanding there \nare some places where fencing can be effective to stop illegal \nimmigration into America. But what we have here has become a symbol for \nthe rightwing in American politics: the symbol of a fence, a fence \nbetween America and Mexico.\n  If you have been a student of politics for a few minutes or a few \ndays, you will know where this is going to end. This proposal by \nSenator Sessions would construct a fence of about 370 miles in length. \nThe House Republicans want to build a fence that is 2,000 miles long. \nSo what will likely happen, should this amendment pass the Senate and \ngo to conference, is we will split the difference, and we will end up \nwith a fence that is over 1,000 miles long on America's southern \nborder. And perhaps, as Senator Kennedy has suggested, it will be the \ndownpayment for a fence that would stretch for 2,000 miles.\n  They have come down from their original request of a 700- or 800-mile \nfence. That was going to be the first thing asked for, when somebody \nsuggested that would be a fence the distance of which could stretch \nfrom the Washington Monument to the Sears Tower in Chicago. That is the \ndistance we are talking about--700 or 800 miles--but that could be the \nultimate result here.\n  The obvious question we have to ask ourselves--I think two \nquestions--No. 1, will it work? If you build a fence like this, will it \nwork? Will it hold people back or will it become our ``Maginot Line''? \nThe Maginot Line was the line of defense built by France after World \nWar I to stop the Germans should they ever want to attack again. And \nthe French invested a great sum of money and all of their national \nsecurity in the idea they could build a line that the Germans could \nnever cross. They waited, knowing they were secure, until World War II \nbegan and the German panzers just crushed the Maginot Line and came \nroaring over it, destroying all of their feelings that they were safe \nforever.\n  I feel the same way about this fence. What fence is it that we will \nbuild that cannot be tunneled under, that you cannot go over or around? \nIs this really going to be an effective deterrent?\n  What we have suggested in the bill, which is completely full of ideas \non enforcement, is to use technology. It may not be this high fence \nthey want to build is the best thing for us. The technology we have \navailable might be much better. We can have a virtual fence which \nachieves much more than a fence, which would cost us millions of \ndollars and be easily overcome. So in the first instance, I am \nconcerned where this will end, how long this fence will be, and \nwhether, in the end, we will be safer in building it.\n  The second thing is the image it creates of a country, that our \nrelationship with Mexico would come down to a barrier between our two \ncountries. I believe we should have a more positive outlook toward \nwhere we are going to be. Working with the Mexican Government, working \nwith them toward the goal of stopping illegal immigration, is far \nbetter than the confrontation of a fence or a wall. I think it could \nbring us to a day when we will have our borders under control, with all \nwe invest in this bill, with what we do by way of enforcement at the \nborder and in the workplace, and with what we do with those who are \ncurrently here in the United States. It is a coordinated and \ncomprehensive approach. It isn't just a matter of building a fence. It \nisn't a matter of enforcement alone. It is enforcement as a starting \npoint.\n\n  My concern about this fence, which is likely to end up being over \n1,000 miles long, is that it will not protect America. It will not stop \nthe illegal flow of immigration. It would create an image of America \nwhich I am not sure we would be proud of in years to come. I will \noppose this amendment.\n\n[[Page S4662]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to bring some relevant and \nimportant facts to the debate. As we have pointed out, we are for \nsecurity of the border. We have outlined, in my earlier comments, the \nprovisions in this legislation which would help to achieve that. I want \nto point out some of the history of the building of a fence and the \ncost of the building of a fence.\n  When the first fence was going to be built, Congressman Hunter, the \nHouse's largest proponent of fencing, originally estimated the cost of \ncompleting the 14 miles of fencing in San Diego at $14 million, the \nsame as the current estimate, I believe, of the Senator from Alabama. \nFencing was completed over 11 miles, and the cost was more than 200 \npercent over budget, costing $42 million. The real cost of construction \nended up being more than $3.8 million per mile. At that rate, a \ncomplete fence across the U.S.-Mexican border would cost $7.6 billion.\n  As was referenced, the House of Representatives position calls for a \n700-mile fence. Congressman Hunter boasts of securing an additional $35 \nmillion for the last 3 miles of fencing in San Diego, approximately $12 \nmillion per mile. These costs are significantly higher because of \ndifficult terrain. Much of the U.S. border with Mexico crosses mountain \nterrain such as these 3 miles, potentially driving up the cost of \nborderwide security.\n  Let's look at what happened in terms of people. Currently, there are \n70 miles of fencing along the U.S.- Mexican border, including 40 miles \nin California and 25 in Arizona. Partial fencing of the U.S.-Mexican \nborder shifted migrant traffic from one area to the other. The \napprehensions dropped in San Diego from a high of 450,000 in 1994, when \nfencing construction began, to a low of 136,000 in 2005, a reduction of \n70 percent. Over the same period, the apprehensions in the Tucson \nsector, covering most of Arizona, rose from 137,000 in 1994 to 489,000, \nalmost an exact shift in migrant traffic from San Diego to Arizona. So \nthe number of apprehensions along the U.S. border from 1994 to 2005 has \nbarely fluctuated, ranging from 900,000 to well over a million per \nyear.\n  What the facts show is that having large-scale fences has been \ngrossly inadequate, if we are talking about security. We need to have \nreal, effective security, as we discussed earlier, the virtual fence, \nusing the latest in technology, and also enforcement of laws in the \nworkplace which will discourage people from coming and which those who \nhave studied this believe to be the most effective.\n  We are talking about a cost of billions of dollars for something that \nhas not been shown to be effective in achieving an outcome. There are \nways of securing the border, but this is not the way to do so, for the \nreasons I outlined earlier and the reasons I cited at this time. We \nhave evaluations of fencing in our legislation. We ought to find out \nwhat is the most effective way, whether we use the virtual fence, the \nnewer technologies, what is having the best and most positive result, \nand invest in that. That is what we ought to do.\n  What we are doing this afternoon is a good-feeling vote, in terms of \ntrying to give some assurances to the American people, which history \nhas shown is highly costly, and in terms of the amount of resources we \nare likely to expend has not been effective.\n  For the reason of raising the kinds of conflicts that we are going to \nhave with our neighbors to the south rather than working with them \neffectively, there are better and more effective ways of securing the \nborder.\n\n  I hope this amendment will be defeated.\n  As I understand it, there is a desire to vote at 2:30. I think I have \nused about all my time. I would be glad to yield back the time, maybe \nmove on to another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we are talking about a possible 2:30 \nvote. The day is badly fragmented with a signing ceremony at the White \nHouse at 1:45, a briefing by Director Negroponte at 3, and a social at \nthe White House at 5. It is pretty hard to see how we get any business \ndone when we dodge in and out of the raindrops in a hurricane. But we \nare talking about a 2:30 vote. If we are to have it, I wanted to stack \nthree votes at that time. We are going to respect what Senator Reid \nwants to do, to take them up one at a time, but we are asking Senator \nVitter to come over right now because we are about to wrap up. Senator \nSessions wants 10 more minutes. I will speak briefly. Then we will \nyield back the remainder of the time. Then after Senator Vitter's \namendment is heard--we have already argued Senator Inhofe's amendment--\nwe may be in a position to stack three votes at 2:30 or very close to \nthat time. That is what we are looking toward.\n  I yield to Senator Sessions for his final 10 minutes and yield back \nthe remainder of the time to move on to Senator Vitter's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we are at a point where everybody in \nthis body--and overwhelmingly, the American people--wants to see a \nlawful system of immigration in America. We can all disagree about what \nto do about the people who have come here illegally already. There are \na lot of ideas about that. We can disagree about what our policy should \nbe in the future, but we pretty well have been unified on that point. \nThe 370 miles of fencing that we are talking about, plus barriers for \nvehicle traffic in a larger amount, has the support of Secretary of \nHomeland Security Chertoff and the administration. They believe it is a \ngood expenditure, and they are prepared to help find the money to fund \nit because it will save money in the long run. It is a one-time \nexpenditure and will be a multiplier of the effectiveness of every \nsingle Border Patrol agent.\n  As we have heard from Senators Cornyn and Kyl, who have visited the \nborder on a regular basis, we have borders that run right through the \nmiddle of towns and communities. How could we possibly put enough \nagents at every corner, every street to guard it? We need to do better \nand we can do better.\n  I am amused by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, saying \nthere is going to be 1,000 miles of fencing. I had originally offered \nin committee 700 miles. That is what the House passed. We have now come \nin and listened to the administration and proposed a modest figure of \n370 total, counting portions of the fence already built in San Diego, \nand those being refurbished in Arizona. The House is at 700. So the \nargument that it is going to be a fence across the whole border or the \nargument that we are going to build 1,000 miles of fence is not very \nplausible. Frankly, if the Senate is at 370 and the House is at 700, we \nare not likely to come out with a compromise at 1,000. What kind of \nargument is that?\n  Then we heard the argument that it is going to bankrupt America. We \nspend over $800 billion a year. We can't find a billion dollars to fix \nthis problem? We certainly can. They ask: Will it work? I say let them \ngo to San Diego. Let them go there and talk to the people on both sides \nof the border where the whole county showed a 56-percent reduction in \ncrime, and on both sides of that fence the economy is booming. It is \nsafe and secure. The smugglers and dope dealers are gone, and things \nare much better off. It is a positive development. Why are we having \nopposition to it?\n  Senator Kyl came close to the truth when he said: Whenever anything \ngets proposed--I am paraphrasing--that might actually work, we get an \nobjection to it. What about a good identifier card? They say something \nlike that makes sense, but every time we get close to having a good \nbiometric identifier card that would actually work, we get all kinds of \nobjections.\n  There is no doubt that some people believe in open borders. There are \npeople who do not want to see this immigration system become a lawful \nsystem. I will repeat, we are a nation of immigrants. We are going to \nincrease the number of immigrants. I will support increasing the number \nof lawful immigrants into our country by a reasonable amount, not three \nto five times the current level that is in this bill today, even after \nwe reduced the numbers last night. Three to five times is way out of \nthe range of what should be accepted. But we are going to increase \nimmigration. We are not against immigration. I reject that. We want to \ntravel across the border, particularly our\n\n[[Page S4663]]\n\nMexican border. It is a very busy place. Senators Kyl and Cornyn are \nfamiliar with that border, and they wouldn't support anything that \nwould back that up.\n  I am confident we are on the right track. We have checked with a \nseries of contractors and looked at the numbers. The best estimate we \nget is that the kind of premier fence we are talking about would be at \nmost $3.2 million per mile, and that would, at 296 miles of new fencing \ncost approximately $940 million, not $14 billion. Where did that come \nfrom? That is not so. It will probably cost around a billion dollars.\n  Remember, as Senator Cornyn reminded us, 1.1 million people are being \narrested each day at that border, 1.1 million. How much does it cost to \ndetain and process those people and deport them and move them out of \nthe country or release them or catch and release, in which they then \nabscond and don't show up to be deported? Is it not better to reduce \nthe number of arrests by creating an effective system that prevents \ncrossing the border rather than all the expense of detecting and \napprehending and deporting?\n  We have had some good discussion. We have talked about these issues \nin a number of ways. With regard to the San Diego fence, according to \nthe FBI crime index, crime in that county dropped 56.3 percent between \n1989 and 2000, after the fence was erected. Vehicle drive-throughs in \nthe region have fallen between 6 to 10 per day before the construction \nof the border infrastructure to only 4 drive-throughs in 2004 for the \nyear. And those occurred only where the secondary fence is incomplete.\n  According to the numbers provided by the San Diego sector of the \nBorder Patrol, in February of 2004, apprehensions decreased from \n531,609. The American people need to hear this as well as Senators. In \n2004, the apprehensions on the San Diego, CA, sector of the border only \nwere 532,689 apprehensions. How expensive is that? Those figures were \nin 1993. And in 2003, after the fence was built, it dropped to 111,000 \nacross that whole sector.\n  So the idea that the fence had no impact and everybody went around it \nis not true. It sent a message that we were serious about creating a \nborder that works, and it reduced by four-fifths the numbers of \narrests. How much money did that save? How much time did that save? And \nit left the Border Patrol officers available to do a lot of different \nthings.\n  In 1993, authorities at the San Diego border apprehended over 58,000 \npounds of marijuana coming across the border from Mexico. In 2003, \nafter the fence, the tide of drugs was reduced and only 36,000 pounds \nof marijuana were apprehended, and cocaine smuggling decreased from \n1,200 pounds to 150 pounds. That is some of the progress that was made.\n  This is a narrow amendment, concentrating on the most important 800, \n500, or 350 miles of fencing, with 500 miles of barriers. It is focused \nand it is what the Department of Homeland Security says they need. It \nis reasonable in cost. It will save money considerably over the long \nrun. It is a one-time expenditure, but it can save us from having \nthousands of permanent investigators, permanent prison bed spaces, and \nthings of that nature. The key to it is to change the perception and \nthe reality of how we are doing business.\n  Let me conclude with that thought. It is important for this country \nto make clear to our own citizens and to the world that a lawful system \nis going to be created, that this is no longer any open border. Once \nthat happens, and once that is absolutely clear, we are going to have \nfewer people attempt to come in. It is that simple. How do you do it?\n  Well, the President's call out to the National Guard is one signal \nthat things have changed. Business as usual is over. Utilizing fencing \nis important. Increasing bed spaces and increasing agents along the \nborder are important. All those things can help us reach a tipping \npoint, a magic point on the seesaw or the balance scale. When it tips, \nit is going to tip so that people will find out it makes more sense to \napply to come here legally, according to our laws, rather than coming \nin illegally. It will add to the workplace enforcement on top of that, \nand you will become serious about immigration.\n  We can do this. It is not hopeless or impossible. For a reasonable \ncost, we can tip the scales from illegality to legality. That is what \nthe American people are asking us to do. A vote for this amendment is a \nstep in that direction.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, when the Judiciary Committee met to \nconsider a comprehensive immigration reform bill, we adopted an \namendment by Senator Kyl on limited fences and barriers along the \nborder. I supported that amendment. It called for replacing and \nrepairing barriers in certain border towns.\n  Now Senator Sessions is offering an amendment to correct what Senator \nKyl had included in the Judiciary Committee bill and that was \nincorporated in the underlying bill now before the Senate. I had \nthought that the Senator from Arizona had consulted with the \nadministration and, in particular, with the Department of Homeland \nSecurity before offering his amendment and that the committee action \nwould have been sufficient. Apparently Senator Sessions and his \ncosponsors, which include a number of Republican Senators on the \nJudiciary Committee, think that the Kyl amendment was inadequate. They \nsay that their discussions with Secretary Chertoff, the Border Patrol, \nand Homeland Security lead them to seek a needed change and correction.\n  As Senator Kennedy noted, the fact may well be that the Secretary and \nthe administration have all the legal authority they need without this \namendment to do what they think needs to be done. That they have not \ndone more before now was not for the lack of authority as far as I \nknow. Nor has Congress refused to provide such authority as may have \nbeen necessary or that has been requested by the administration.\n  On this point, I quote a column from today's Roll Call authored by \nNorman Ornstein. He concludes:\n\n       For nearly five years, we drastically have underfunded our \n     first responders while failing to coordinate plans across \n     state and regional lines. We still do not have interoperable \n     communications among first responders. We have underfunded \n     border security despite warnings that immigration issues were \n     intertwined with basic security issues. No wonder this issue \n     has exploded on the national scene, and no wonder we are \n     seeing this belated move to ``solve'' the problem with a \n     National Guard presence.\n       Where has Congress been in all of this? For nearly five \n     years, absent without leave. It's been AWOL on oversight, \n     AWOL on serious legislation to deal with either the lapses in \n     the department or the broader problem of border security, \n     AWOL on serious deliberations about broader immigration \n     issues, AWOL on seeking bipartisan solutions for difficult \n     problems that need some consensus in the middle. And it's \n     been worse than AWOL in making sure that we have institutions \n     of governance after the next massive attack. Congress' \n     approval rating is 22 percent? That seems too high.\n\n  Sadly, there is much truth in what Mr. Ornstein writes. During \nRepublican congressional control they have slavishly taken their cues \nfrom the Republican administration and defended its every misstep.\n  With respect to the Sessions amendment I have questions, questions \nabout its value and whether it is meant to signal some kind of \n``fortress America'' approach to real world problems. I also have \nquestions about its cost and how the Senator from Alabama intends to \npay for its additional costs. He said during the course of the debate \nthat he estimated that it would cost an additional billion dollars. On \nthe day that the President is signing into law billions of dollars of \nadditional tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans, I wonder whether we \nmight not have been wiser to set aside a billion dollars from those tax \nbreaks being provided millionaires to help fund enforcement measures \nfor America's border security.\n  The Congressional Budget Office says that this bill will require more \nthan $54 billion in expenditures. The Sessions amendment will add \nadditional costs. Is it several hundred million dollars, a billion \ndollars, as the Senator from Alabama has estimated, or more? The \nSenator from Texas has said that this bill is merely a downpayment on \nwhat it will cost to secure our borders. I wonder what the Senator from \nTexas believes this will eventually cost. I wonder how he intends to \npay for these measures. Under Republican leadership we are already \nrunning the largest annual deficits in history and have turned a $5 \ntrillion surplus into a projected debt of somewhere between $8 trillion \nto $10 trillion.\n\n[[Page S4664]]\n\n  Earlier today the Republican chairman of the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee came to the Senate to make an extraordinary \nstatement. I am sorry he spoke to an almost empty floor. I urge all \nSenators to consider his remarks. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nsomeone I have worked with to provide interoperable communications to \nlaw enforcement along the shared border of our States. He is one of the \nmost straight-talking Members of the Senate and he demonstrated that \nagain today. He said today that the $1.9 billion capital account he had \nsought to establish for border security improvements is gone, that it \nhas been transferred to operational needs. In addition, he expressed \nregret for having had to structure his amendment to the emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill to take funds from military accounts \nin order to allocate it to border security.\n  In that regard, the Democratic leader has been proven right in his \namendment that would have provided the $1.9 billion without taking \nfunds from our troops. Now the Senator from New Hampshire says that he \nunderstands that his amendment will not survive the House-Senate \nemergency supplemental appropriations conference. The Democratic leader \nwas right to offer his amendment and the Senate would have been wiser \nhad it adopted it to fund border security with real dollars. As matters \nnow stand, if Senator Gregg is correct, it appears there is no money in \nthe budget or available to fund these measures. Let us not make false \npromises to the American people about border security. Let us not call \nfor measures that we will not be able to pay for but wish to trumpet.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Roll Call, May 17, 2006]\n\n       Congress' Neglect of Immigration Is Why We're Stuck Today\n\n                          (By Norman Ornstein)\n\n       Why do we need members of the National Guard patrolling our \n     borders? It is a question, frankly, that doesn't have a very \n     edifying answer. The National Guard is spread way too thin as \n     it is, and I am not sure how many members are eager to go \n     from two tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan to a new tour \n     in Nogales.\n       If the response to that is, ``Well, we are just sending \n     token numbers''--6,000--the counter-response is, ``Why mess \n     with the Guard for token purposes when the results will \n     include sharper tension with Mexico over the issue of \n     militarizing the border and fodder for Hugo Chavez and our \n     other hemispheric adversaries to dump on the imperialist and \n     militaristic USA?'' Then there's the issue of whether \n     anything in the training of the National Guard prepares them \n     for border patrol work, whether on the front lines or back in \n     the office doing paperwork.\n       Of course, we know the less edifying answers. The president \n     needed a symbol of his determination to toughen the borders \n     in order to pacify his base and to get conservatives in \n     Congress to consider the immigration plan advanced by Sens. \n     John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) to \n     legalize many of the illegals who have been in the country \n     for years without having to expel 12 million people or more.\n       This is necessary because the House Republican leadership \n     will not move a bill that has broad bipartisan support if it \n     comes at the expense of losing even a sliver of the party's \n     ideological base. There is another reason. We need some \n     supplements for the undermanned border patrol forces who are \n     themselves spread way too thin. The failures of the border \n     patrol--not just caused by inadequate numbers but also by \n     dysfunction within their agency and a continuing set of \n     problems with coordinating responsibilities with federal \n     customs and immigration officials--have led to serious public \n     unhappiness in border states, especially Arizona, New Mexico \n     and Texas, and a need for some kind of governmental response.\n       I find it more disturbing to dwell on the dynamics of this \n     issue after seeing the film United 93 over the weekend. It is \n     a superb movie, and the one-word description of it given by \n     virtually everyone who has seen it--``harrowing''--is \n     accurate. But to a student of government, the harrowing part \n     goes well beyond reliving the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks and watching a graphic portrayal of a suicide-\n     hijacking mission. The movie portrays a government in near-\n     chaos, with the limited communication between the Federal \n     Aviation Administration, air traffic controllers and the \n     military filled with misinformation and nearly inexplicable \n     delays. The military was unable to scramble any significant \n     force to protect the airspace around Washington, D.C., for a \n     long time after it became clear that the capital--and the \n     Capitol--were obvious targets of the terrorist attack.\n       Perhaps others left the theater with a belief that the \n     chaos was understandable; after all, who would have imagined \n     a broad-based, concerted effort by suicidal terrorists to \n     kill thousands of people in coordinated attacks on American \n     soil? Most moviegoers probably felt a small sense of relief \n     that at least now, more than four years later, we have \n     learned some lessons, beefed up the communications among \n     these agencies and the rapid response necessary when \n     another attack occurs. But I did not.\n       The response by the federal government since Sept. 11 has \n     been reluctant, halting and generally ineffectual in most \n     areas of homeland security. I have no reason to believe that \n     we have had a systematic effort to improve communications and \n     coordination--not just between the FAA and the Pentagon but \n     among other agencies that might be on the front lines in the \n     next attack, which is not likely to come from commercial \n     airliners.\n       I also know that the creation of the Department of Homeland \n     Security--long after it was clear that the office setup in \n     the White House was inadequate to the task--was done in a \n     textbook fashion, specifically a textbook showing how not to \n     do a major reorganization. Instead of focusing on the \n     problems in border security by integrating the jobs of border \n     patrol, customs, immigration and the Coast Guard, and instead \n     of focusing intensely on crafting a strong bureaucratic \n     culture around their shared missions, the White House and \n     Congress brought together 20 disparate units in a massive \n     reorganization that hasn't come close to working and will \n     take many more years to become functional.\n       We saw what happened with Hurricane Katrina, and the \n     problems with the Federal Emergency Management Agency are \n     manifest in the border area and many others. We are woefully \n     unprepared to deal with a biological attack, a pandemic, a \n     massive natural disaster or another broad-based terrorist \n     attack. One is coming--we just don't know when. United 93 \n     underscores the ominous reality that al-Qaida takes a long \n     time doing its planning before making its move. It is surely \n     planning the next one as I write.\n       For nearly five years, we drastically have underfunded our \n     first responders while failing to coordinate plans across \n     state and regional lines. We still do not have interoperable \n     communications among first responders. We have underfunded \n     border security despite warnings that immigration issues were \n     intertwined with basic security issues. No wonder this issue \n     has exploded on the national scene, and no wonder we are \n     seeing this belated move to ``solve'' the problem with a \n     National Guard presence.\n       Where has Congress been in all of this? For nearly five \n     years, absent without leave. It's been AWOL on oversight, \n     AWOL on serious legislation to deal with either the lapses in \n     the department or the broader problems of border security, \n     AWOL on serious deliberation about broader immigration \n     issues, AWOL on seeking bipartisan solutions for difficult \n     problems that need some consensus in the middle. And it's \n     been worse than AWOL in making sure that we have institutions \n     of governance after the next massive attack. Congress' \n     approval rating is 22 percent? That seems too high.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the issue of border security is \nobviously a vital matter. The assurances that we will be able to check \nthe flow of illegal immigrants will materially aid in the passage of \nthis bill, a comprehensive bill--if assurances can be given that the \nborder is secure and also with employer sanctions.\n  I think the Senator from Alabama has submitted a good amendment. It \ndoes not have the overtone of the enormous fence along the entire \nborder, stretching 2,000 miles. It is targeted. We have been advised by \nthe administration, by Secretary Chertoff, that there is support for \nthe amendment of the Senator from Alabama. That is about what they are \nlooking for. They have made a detailed analysis. Secretary Chertoff met \nwith the Judiciary Committee on a very extensive briefing 2 weeks ago. \nWe talked about this at length. For those reasons, I plan to support \nthe Sessions amendment.\n  Madam President, I am prepared to yield back all time if Senator \nSessions and Senator Kennedy are prepared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If we can yield back time, we are prepared to go on to \nanother amendment. We are trying to structure it so we will have three \nvotes in the range of 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I have not yielded back my time. I may \nyield back my time. I will have to get a short quorum call if we are \ngoing to ask consent on establishing--unless our leaders have agreed to \nhave the series, I would have a short quorum call until we can clear \nthat.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, while the Senator from Massachusetts\n\n[[Page S4665]]\n\nis working out the questions, I have discussed with him setting aside \ntemporarily the Sessions amendment so that we can proceed to the Vitter \namendment and not waste any time. Madam President, I have discussed it \nwith Senator Vitter, who is agreeable with an hour and a half equally \ndivided. I have made that suggestion to Senator Kennedy. He is going to \nrun it by his leadership to see if it is acceptable on his side. Why \ndon't we proceed as if it is so that Senator Vitter is recognized now \nand starts to talk, and it will count against his time when we finally \nget the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time on the Sessions amendment yielded \nback?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield back my time and Senator Sessions yields back \nhis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think the record is closed on the Sessions amendment, \nand we are now proceeding to the Vitter amendment, and we will await \nSenator Kennedy's comment as to the unanimous consent request on an \nhour and a half. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3963\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3963.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Sessions amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Vitter) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3963.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the provisions related to certain undocumented \n                              individuals)\n\n       Strike sections 601 through 614.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I bring before the Senate an important \namendment, I believe, which goes to the heart of so many American \nconcerns about the bill before us.\n  I must say, in the beginning discussion of this amendment, that I \nhave grave concerns about this bill. I think it is a mistake in many \naspects. I think it ignores history and ignores very specific, concrete \nexperience. Not too long ago, in 1986, Congress passed similar \nmeasures, albeit on a much smaller scale, which ultimately and clearly \nfailed to solve the immigration problem.\n  I am very fearful that we are repeating history, only on a much \nbroader, much bigger, much more dangerous scale. My amendment goes to \nthe heart of those concerns, goes to the heart of the matter, goes to \nthe absolute heart of what so many Americans find most objectionable \nabout the bill on the floor. That is what I would characterize what \ntens of millions of Americans characterize as amnesty provisions in \nthis bill.\n  In introducing this amendment, let me thank the many coauthors I have \nwho are in strong support of it: Senators Grassley, Chambliss, and \nSantorum. Also, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Coburn be added to \nthis list of original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. All of us join together with tens of millions of \nAmericans to simply say we cannot have amnesty provisions in this bill. \nWe cannot have anything approaching amnesty in this measure. So my \namendment would very clearly, very simply, withdraw those provisions \nfrom the bill.\n  Madam President, as I noted while speaking on another amendment about \nan hour ago, this is an interesting debate. The country, including the \nSenate, is widely divided on the question in many respects. Passions \nrun deep from one end of the argument to the other. Yet to listen to \nthe debate, particularly on the Senate floor in the midst of a \nfundamental disagreement, it is interesting that nobody says they are \nfor amnesty, and everybody says they are for enforcement.\n  But, of course, the devil is in the details. Of course, it depends on \nwhat you mean by amnesty, what you mean by enforcement. And what I mean \nby amnesty certainly covers many provisions of the underlying bill, \nwhich my amendment would strike. More importantly, what tens of \nmillions of Americans know through common sense, basic reasoning is \namnesty is included in this underlying bill and we must take it out.\n  Maybe we can begin the discussion with what is amnesty. Well, the \nPresident, in his speech 2 nights ago, said that he is not for amnesty \nand ``they''--meaning illegal aliens--``should not be given an \nautomatic path to citizenship.'' What is an automatic path to \ncitizenship? The President himself, again, 2 nights ago, pointed to \nthis distinction: ``that middle ground''--the one he is advocating--\n``recognizes that there are differences between an illegal immigrant \nwho crossed the border recently and someone who has worked here for \nmany years and has a home, a family, and an otherwise clean record.''\n  So what the President points to, in terms of why the provisions in \nthis bill are not amnesty, is that distinction between folks who \ncrossed the border illegally very recently and those who have been here \nfor some time. I think it is very important, if we think about that \ndistinction, to look at the details of the bill.\n  I encourage my colleagues to actually read this bill. The devil is in \nthe details. If that were ever true, it is true in terms of this \nlegislation. It is important to read the bill and understand the \ndetails. Yes, this bill does make a distinction between those who have \nbeen in the country 5 years or longer and those who have been in the \ncountry less than 5 years, and some other distinctions, 2 years and \nbetween 2 and 5 years. But again, the devil is in the details.\n  How does an illegal immigrant prove that he has been in the country \nover 5 years? You would assume the proof required is specific \ndocumentation which has been verified by the Government or other \nauthentication sources. Those documents are certainly accepted, but \nthey are not required, because if an illegal immigrant doesn't have \nthose sources of documents--objective evidence--he or she can do \nsomething else. He or she can get a piece of paper, declare that he or \nshe has been in the country over 5 years, sign his or her name to it, \nand that is it. That is all that is required.\n  Well, if the President's argument that this is not amnesty in large \npart hinges on this big distinction that we are not giving a path to \ncitizenship for those who have been in the country a shorter period of \ntime, should it not matter what documentary evidence is required? \nDoesn't it make a farce of the whole distinction if that immigrant can \nsimply sign a piece of paper declaring otherwise? That obliterates the \nentire distinction. That means, in fact, that we are making available \nthis fairly automatic path to citizenship to virtually everyone in the \ncountry illegally.\n\n  The President also points to four requirements: This is not amnesty \nbecause there is a penalty the immigrant has to pay because they have \nto pay their taxes, because they have to learn English, and because \nthey have to be in a job for a number of years.\n  Again, I say to my fellow Senators and everyone watching this debate, \nthe devil is in the details. Let's look at this bill. Let's look at \nwhat it requires.\n  No. 1, a penalty. It is true, the underlying bill means a person has \nto pay $2,000--$2,000--which is less, in some cases far less, than many \nlegal immigrants pay to go through the legal process. Is it a penalty \nwhen the amount of money required is the same or, in many cases, less \nthan a person who is following all the rules, doing everything we ask \nof them, following the law, living by the law, becoming a legal \nimmigrant and a full citizen through the legal process?\n  No. 2, pay all their taxes. Well, not all their taxes. A person \ndoesn't have to pay all of their back taxes. They have to pay a certain \nnumber of years; they do not have to go back for the entire length of \ntime that person was in the country. Again, they are being treated \nbetter than the folks who have lived by the rules from the word go than \nthe folks who are citizens through the legal immigration process who \nhave had to pay taxes every step of the\n\n[[Page S4666]]\n\nway. Those folks who live by the rules have to pay all their taxes. \nThese folks do not have to pay all their back taxes by any stretch of \nthe imagination. The devil is in the details.\n  No. 3, learn English. Well, not necessarily learn English. The actual \nrequirement can be met simply by being enrolled in an approved English \nlanguage and history program. Again, the requirement can be met simply \nby being enrolled in a program with no test at the end of the program \nabout proficiency or anything else.\n  And No. 4, work in a job for a number of years. Well, not the full \nperiod for a number of years, only 60 percent of the time for a handful \nof years.\n  Again, the devil is in the details, and I suggest that when the \nAmerican people look at those details and ask themselves, is this \namnesty, is this a fairly automatic path to citizenship, the answer \nwill clearly be yes.\n  What does this sort of amnesty program do? We can debate about that, \nwe can bring up hypotheticals, we can say I think it is going to do \nthis, may do that, but the sure answer is to study history--and not \nancient history, but recent history, going back only to 1986 because \nthe last time Congress acted on this matter in a major way, it put \ntogether a package strikingly similar to this general package before \nus, which included an amnesty provision for agricultural workers.\n  One of the most interesting exercises I performed in thinking about \nthis issue, in getting ready for this floor debate, was to go back to \nthat time period, the mid-1980s, and read some of the arguments made in \nthis Chamber, including the arguments of the folks who were for that \nimmigration reform proposal of 1986.\n  The arguments they made are strikingly similar to the arguments being \nmade by the proponents today: We need to do something comprehensive; it \ncan't be enforcement only; we need to do this provision for earned \ncitizenship, once, this one time, and then the problem will be solved \nforever because we will have border security and will have dealt with \nillegal immigrants then in our country.\n  What is the bottom line on that experiment doing exactly what we are \ndebating doing again? The bottom line is not very hopeful in terms of \nsolving the problem once and for all. The bottom line is back then the \nflow of illegal aliens was 140,000 per year, and now the flow is \n700,000 per year. So it didn't exactly stop the problem.\n  The bottom line is back then the number of illegal aliens in the \ncountry was perhaps about 3 million, and today, by conservative \nestimates, it is 12 million. It didn't exactly solve the problem.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, will the Senator from Louisiana yield \nfor a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. VITTER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, we have now worked out that we will \nconclude Senator Vitter's amendment, then we will go to Senator Obama's \namendment, which I believe we can accept.\n  I ask unanimous consent that between now and 2 o'clock, the time will \nbe equally divided between Senator Vitter on one side and Senator \nKennedy and myself on the other.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Kennedy and I will divide the time evenly, and \nwe are agreed we will have two votes at 2:30 p.m. or perhaps 3 p.m. if \nthe Obama amendment is to have a vote, but I do not expect it. And we \npreclude second-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reclaiming my time, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, there have been significant studies \nsince 1986 that have looked specifically at the impact of what Congress \ndid then. What do these studies show?\n  A 2000 report by the Center for Immigration Studies states:\n\n       INS estimates show that the 1986 amnesty almost certainly \n     increased illegal immigration, as the relatives of newly \n     legalized illegals came to the United States to join their \n     family members.\n\n  Again, these are INS statistics, not some think tank on the \nconservative side. These INS statistics show that even though 2.7 \nmillion illegal aliens were granted lawful citizenship through the \namnesty program--and by the way, that was far more than anticipated--\nwithin 10 years, a new illegal alien population had replaced all of \nthose and had grown to 5 million. That growth only continued.\n  Again, that growth today has gone from 140,000 illegal aliens \nstreaming across the border per year back in 1986 to 700,000 per year \ntoday. That growth has been 3 million illegal aliens in the country \ngoing back to 1986 to at least 12 million today.\n  There was another study in 1992, 6 years after the agricultural \namnesty program was passed. The Commission on Agricultural Workers \nissued a report to Congress--so a specific report to Congress that \nstudied the effects, again, of the 1986 agricultural amnesty program. \nFirst, the Commission found that the number of workers amnestied under \nthe bill had been severely underestimated. So the numbers that were \ntalked about, in fact, the true numbers were well more than that.\n  Second, the Commission found that the agricultural worker amnesty \nonly exacerbated existing problems:\n\n       Six years after IRCA was signed into law, the problems \n     within the system of agricultural labor continued to exist. . \n     . . In most areas, an increasing number of newly arriving \n     unauthorized workers compete for available jobs, reducing the \n     number of work hours available to all harvest workers and \n     contributing to lower annual earnings. . . .\n\n  Again, the bottom line is very clear. We had the same arguments back \nthen as today: Let's do this once, the problem is solved forever; we \nwill get tough with enforcement, we promise; really, we mean it. And \nwhat happened? That 140,000 per year increased to 700,000 per year. The \nproblem of 3 million illegal aliens has increased to at least 12 \nmillion. We do need to study history and see what the impact of this \namnesty program in this bill will be.\n  This threat is particularly grave, and I think it is absolutely \ncertain that this will exacerbate the problem for the following simple \nreason: In terms of border security, everyone--everyone--on the floor \nof this body, everyone agrees that true border security cannot and will \nnot happen overnight. The best case, if we are sincere about it, if we \nfollow up this debate with adequate appropriations, the money, the \nmanpower, the resources, the focus, the best case is that we will get a \nhandle on our border in several years, perhaps 2 to 3 years, absolute \nminimum. But, of course, the other elements of this bill would be \npassed into law and would go into effect immediately. That is repeating \nthe exact mistake of 1986. It would be one thing to consider an amnesty \nprogram down the road after we have acted on border security and proven \nthat we have executed meaningful border security.\n  I don't think I could be for it even in that circumstance. That would \nbe one thing. But what this bill does is something far different and \neven far more dangerous. What this bill does is put that program into \neffect now, immediately, move forward with that amnesty track \nimmediately, even though everyone agrees, best case, we will only have \nmeaningful border security in several years. So we establish the magnet \nto draw more illegal aliens into the country before anyone pretends \nthat we have adequate border security or workplace security.\n  That is an even clearer reason that this is a big mistake and \nrepeating the mistakes of the past, particularly in the era around \n1986, on a much grander and, therefore, more troublesome scale.\n  Another point I wish to make is the overall numbers these provisions \nwill lead to because I think there has been a lot of fuzzy math and a \nlack of attention to detail on this question. Again, the devil is in \nthe details. Let's read this bill. Let's look at this bill and \nunderstand the full consequences of this bill, including the amnesty \nprogram.\n  The number folks toss around most commonly on the floor of the \nSenate, as well as in the wider debate around the country, is 12 \nmillion illegal aliens are currently in this country. Most experts seem \nto think that is a pretty minimum number. It could be significantly \nabove that. Again, we need to look at the bill, and we need to \nunderstand the details because that is not the total number who may be \neligible for citizenship.\n  The bill is very liberal and very broad in granting this citizenship \npath to an extended definition of family\n\n[[Page S4667]]\n\nmembers of these folks. So in fact, as a direct, immediate result of \nthis bill, we could well have about 30 million folks on that \ncitizenship path, getting on that path very quickly.\n  Over an extended number of years, that number will be far larger. \nEstimates, for instance, by Robert Rector over a 20-year period after \nenactment of this underlying bill is that it would mean a minimum of \n103 million new folks gaining citizenship, possibly much higher. Again, \nthe devil is in the details. Let's look hard at the numbers. Let's add \nit up. We are not talking about 12 million, we are talking about 30 \nmillion immediately. We are talking about huge numbers, 100 million or \nmore over 20 years.\n  Finally, the argument that is most often put up against avoiding this \nsort of amnesty program is that we can't make felons of all these \nmillions of illegal aliens in the country. We can't round them up and \ndeport them. It is impractical. It may not be a good idea, even if we \ncould do it. President Bush made this specific argument 2 nights ago. \nMany of my colleagues on the Senate floor have made the same argument.\n  The truth is that is not the alternative. That is a straw man, an \neasy argument to push aside and defeat. That is not the practical \nalternative at all. The practical alternative to rushing toward an \namnesty program is to do meaningful things with regard to enforcement \nand other measures in the country that on their own can decrease the \nillegal alien population in this country over time.\n  Let me mention six items in particular: Secure the borders through \nBorder Patrol agents, increase fencing, substantially increase \ndetention space and do that before we do anything else. Some provisions \nare in this bill, but it is not being done before we move on to other \naspects of the bill.\n\n  No. 2: Implement strong and serious worksite enforcement measures \nand, again, do that before other aspects of the bill are implemented.\n  No. 3: Eliminate document fraud through the use of biometrics, \nimmigration documents, and secure Social Security cards.\n  No. 4: Reform existing laws to reduce the incentive to work illegally \nby providing the IRS with increased resources to investigate and \nsanction both employers and illegal aliens for submitting fraudulent \ntax returns, requiring the Social Security Administration to share \ninformation with DHS when no match letters are sent to employers, and \nbarring illegal workers from counting work performed illegally toward \nSocial Security.\n  No. 5: Encourage State and local law enforcement to enforce \nimmigration laws themselves by giving them authority and by requiring \nthe Feds to reimburse them for expenses directly related to that \nenforcement, and enhancing coordination and information sharing between \nthe State and local law enforcement and Federal immigration \nauthorities.\n  No. 6: Provide the Department of Homeland Security and the Department \nof Justice with the necessary resources to perform their jobs.\n  Madam President, these six things, without an amnesty program, would, \nin fact, lower the population of illegal aliens in this country over \ntime. Why would it lower it? Because it would remove the incentives for \nthose folks to stay here. It would remove the mechanism by which they \ncan successfully stay in this country and gain employment.\n  So again, it is a straw man to talk about making all of these people \nfelons. My amendment doesn't do that. We are not proposing that on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is a straw man to talk about rounding up 12 \nmillion people around the country. It is a completely false argument to \nsuggest that the only alternative to essentially amnesty is to have to \ndo that and deport all 12 million of these people.\n  The practical alternative, which we can absolutely do, is avoid \namnesty while implementing steps such as these six things. And that \nwill provide real border security and real workplace security by \ndemanding absolute requirements that ensure that folks getting jobs are \nlegal immigrants, not illegals. That is the practical alternative \nwhich, over time, can dramatically reduce the illegal population in the \ncountry.\n  I don't know of any single aspect of this bill before us on the floor \nof the Senate that has Americans more concerned than these amnesty \nprovisions. It goes to the heart of this debate. It goes to the heart \nof Americans' concerns that, once again, we are talking a good game \nabout enforcement, but we are not demanding that it happen before \nconsidering other aspects of the bill. It goes to the heart of our \nexperience in 1986, when that agricultural worker amnesty program \nclearly--clearly--was a huge part of the failure of that attempt to get \nour hands around illegal immigration. It was a huge part of the flow \nacross our border, ballooning from 170,000 per year to 700,000 per \nyear, and a huge part of the illegal population in our country \nskyrocketing from about 3 million to over 12 million.\n  So this is an important amendment that goes to the heart of so many \nAmericans' concerns about the bill which are reflected in townhall \nmeetings and discussions I have all across Louisiana. It is also \nreflected in every major national public opinion poll on the subject. \nOver and over again, Americans make very clear the huge majority want \nenforcement. There is a legitimate debate about a temporary worker \nprogram, but a huge majority have fundamental problems with these \nprovisions which they know, using common sense, particularly when they \nunderstand the details of the bill, amount to absolute amnesty.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if I could clarify the request to \nunderstand that under our previous unanimous consent agreement on this \namendment, it will come out of the time of the opposition.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in a moment of seriousness, what is the \nparliamentary situation? How much time on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 2 o'clock is divided between \nthe Senator from Louisiana and the Senators from Massachusetts and \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 10 \nminutes, taken from the time of the opposition to the amendment, which \nis the time of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my friend from \nLouisiana. Of course, it is not amnesty. Of course, it is not amnesty. \nI urge my colleagues, as well as specifically my colleague from \nLouisiana--next time up, I am going to bring a dictionary out here to \nconfirm the definition of the word ``amnesty.'' The definition of the \nword ``amnesty'' is forgiveness. We did that in the 1980s and it didn't \nwork. And to call the process that we require under this legislation \namnesty, frankly, distorts the debate and is an unfair interpretation \nof it. I might add that the President of the United States, in a very \npowerful statement to the American people, called it what it is, and \nthat is earned citizenship.\n  Now, I understand why the opponents of what we are trying to do would \ncall it amnesty. That is a great idea. Call it amnesty. Call it a \nbanana, if you want to. But the fact is that it is earned citizenship. \nThe reason why the opponents of this legislation keep calling it \namnesty is because they know that in poll after poll after poll, the \nmajority of the American people say let them earn their citizenship. \nAnd when it is explained to the American people what we are requiring: \nA criminal background check, payment of back taxes, payment of a $2,000 \nfine, 5 or 6 years before getting in line behind everyone else in order \nto get a green card and then another 5 years or more, depending on how \nthis legislation comes out, before eligibility for citizenship, it is a \nperversion of the word ``amnesty.'' Frankly, I am growing a little \nweary of it. I am growing a little weary of it. We ought to be debating \nthis issue on its merits and only on the merits and not by labeling it \nsomething it is not.\n  Again, the definition of amnesty is forgiveness--forgiveness. We are \nnot forgiving anything. We are trying to\n\n[[Page S4668]]\n\nfind the best option--the best option--for an untenable situation bred \nby 40 or 50 years of failed Government policies.\n  What are the options we have with these 11 million or 12 million \npeople? What are the options? One is the status quo. No one believes \nthat the status quo is acceptable, to have 11 million or 12 million \npeople washing around America's society with no protection of our laws, \nno accountability, no identity. It is terrible for America and our \nsociety. I believe the sponsors of this amendment and those of us who \nvehemently oppose it, because basically it guts the entire proposal, \nincluding the fact it is in direct contradiction to the leader of our \nparty, the position of the President of the United States on it--but \nhaving said that, the status quo, I think my friend from Louisiana \nwould agree, is unacceptable.\n  So what is the other option? The other option is to round up 11 \nmillion people and find some way to transport them back to the country \nfrom which they came. Many of them have been here since yesterday. Some \nof them have been here 50 or 60 years. Some of them have children who \nare fighting in Iraq. I am not interested--I wonder if the Senator from \nLouisiana is interested--in calling a soldier in Iraq and saying: By \nthe way, while you are fighting today, we are deporting your parents. I \ndon't think we want to do that. I don't think we want to do that.\n  And by the way, the columnist George Will pointed out the other day \nit would take some 200,000 buses from San Diego to Alaska in order to \ntransport these people at least back to Mexico, and then I don't know \nhow you get them back to other places.\n  So here we are with the option of the status quo, rounding up 11 \nmillion or 12 million people, or making it very clear that because they \nhave broken our laws, they must pay a very severe penalty--a very \nsevere penalty. And according to the Hagel-Martinez compromise, those \npeople who have been here less than 5 years will have to go back. And \nin the case of 2 to 5 years, they will have to go back to a port of \nembarkation. If they have been here since January 1, 2004, then they \nhave to go back completely--completely. If they have been here more \nthan 5 years, then obviously we have given them a way to earn \ncitizenship.\n  We passed an amendment that we supported that was the Kyl-Cornyn \namendment, supported by me and Senator Graham and Senator Kennedy and \nothers, that would prevent felons from ever being on the path to \ncitizenship. So what does that say? What this proposal now says is \nanyone who came here innocently, who came here to work, which is the \nreason why the overwhelming majority of them did, will have a chance to \nearn their citizenship. And every time--every time--that the word \n``amnesty'' is mentioned, I am going to try to get back on the floor \nand refute that because the description in no way fits the word.\n  So here we are now with a comprehensive approach to immigration \nreform which, probably, according to at least most polls, the American \npeople are, overall, supportive of, and a President of the United \nStates who gave what I think is one of the finest speeches of his \npresidency on this issue, and we are now considering an amendment which \nwould fundamentally gut the entire proposal.\n  I want to quote from the President, again:\n\n       It is neither wise nor realistic to round up millions of \n     people, many with deep roots in the United States, and send \n     them across the border. There is a rational middle ground \n     between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every \n     illegal immigrant, and a program of mass deportation. That \n     middle ground recognizes that there are differences between \n     an illegal immigrant who crossed the border recently and \n     someone who has worked here for many years and has a home, a \n     family, and an otherwise clean record. I believe that illegal \n     immigrants who have roots in our country and want to stay \n     should have to pay a meaningful penalty for breaking the law: \n     To pay their taxes, to learn English, and to work in a job \n     for a number of years. People who meet these conditions \n     should be able to apply for citizenship, but approval would \n     not be automatic, and they will have to wait in line behind \n     those who played by the rules and followed the law. What I \n     have described is not amnesty. It is a way for those who have \n     broken the law to pay their debt to society and demonstrate \n     the character that makes a good citizen.\n\n  I could not say it better than what the President of the United \nStates says.\n  Fundamentally, Americans are decent, humane, wonderful people, and \nthey recognize that these are human beings. They recognize that 99 \npercent of these people came here because they couldn't work, feed \ntheir families and themselves where they came from. As former President \nJohn F. Kennedy wrote, we are a nation of immigrants. We are all a \nnation of immigrants. I urge my colleagues to take a look at the words \nthat were written back in the early 1960s by then-President Kennedy and \nthat apply to the world today. It has a unique and very timely \napplication. I intend to read from it as we proceed with the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  I understand that there are differing viewpoints about how to handle \nthis issue of illegal immigration. There is no State that has been more \nburdened with the consequences of illegal immigration than mine. We \nhave broken borders. We have shootouts on our freeways. We have safe \nhouses where people are jammed in, in the most inhumane conditions. We \nhave the coyotes who take someone across the border and say: Tucson is \nright over the hill. And more and more people every year are dying in \nthe desert. We understand that. That's why we understand that there has \nto be a comprehensive approach to this issue and only a comprehensive \napproach will reach the kind of resolution to this issue which has \nplagued our Nation and, frankly, my State of Arizona, for a long period \nof time.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will understand that this is basically an \neviscerating amendment we are considering. Have no doubt about it. If \nyou agree with the President of the United States and the majority of \nAmericans--poll after poll shows that the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans believe that we should allow people who are here illegally, \nafter a certain period of time, to earn their citizenship--then you \nwill vote against this amendment. If you believe that the only answer \nto our immigration problem is to build a bigger wall, then I would \nargue you are not totally aware of the conditions of the human heart \nand that is that all people, wherever they are, who are created equal, \nhave the same ambitions for themselves and their families and their \nchildren and their grandchildren that we did and our forebears did. Our \nforebears, whether they came with the Mayflower or whether they came \nyesterday, all have the same yearnings to breathe free.\n  I hope my colleagues will understand the implications of this \namendment. I hope my colleagues on this side of the aisle will \nunderstand the implications for the Republican Party of this kind of an \namendment. Because what this is saying to millions and millions of \npeople who have come here is: I am sorry, you are leaving.\n  I hope we can appeal to the better angels of our nature and turn down \nthis amendment and move forward with a comprehensive solution to this \nterrible problem that plagues our Nation.\n  I believe my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for 5 minutes to respond to some of \nthe arguments of the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, what is amnesty? I'll tell you what \nMerriam-Webster's dictionary says:\n\n       [T]he act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon \n     is granted to a large group of individuals.\n\n  What we are talking about is a large group of individuals illegally \nin the country. And the main consequence of that, under present law, is \nto leave the country. Surely, under this provision, we are pardoning \nthem from that main consequence. Surely, this is a pardon from what \npresent law states must happen to folks who have come into this country \nillegally, who stay in this country illegally.\n  The Senator from Arizona made several points, all of which I \nessentially rebutted in my comments before. There is a big distinction \nin this bill between those who have been here over 5 years and those \nunder. There is on paper. And guess what. An illegal alien can satisfy \nthe requirements of the bill that they have been here over 5 years and \nget all of the benefits of this amnesty program\n\n[[Page S4669]]\n\nby simply signing a piece of paper himself that it is so. It makes a \nmockery of the distinction.\n  The other requirements--a penalty. Yes, a penalty, which is less \nmoney than many immigrants pay to go through the legal process. Is that \na penalty?\n  Paying back taxes--well, not all of them. Paying some back taxes. \nThat is certainly less than folks who have gone through the legal \nprocess have had to do.\n  Learning English--well, not exactly. Being enrolled in a program is \ngood enough, not proving any proficiency.\n  And working in a job solidly for a number of years. Well, not solidly \nfor a number of years; 60 percent of the time is good enough.\n  The devil is in the details. I invite Members to look at the \ndefinition of amnesty. I invite Members to study the details of this \nbill because the American people certainly will and will come to the \nclear conclusion that is what it is and is a repeat of the mistake of \npast experience.\n  I would now like to yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, before I give my remarks, I would like \nto extend a thank you to the Senator from Arizona and to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. During the debate on this issue a couple of weeks \nago, it became pretty obvious that there were some Members in this body \nwho did not want to see the Senate function the way it always has, with \nrespect to legislation, and that is to give all Members of this body \nthe opportunity to debate an issue, to submit amendments, and to \nultimately have a vote on those amendments and a vote on the \nlegislation. Were it not for the efforts of Senator McCain and Senator \nKennedy, we would have been at a deadlock, once again, and those of us \nwho object to this underlying bill would not have had the opportunity \nto see the Senate work its will. So I do extend a thank you to these \nSenators for the very professional way in which they handled themselves \nduring the course of the debate a couple of weeks ago, as well as right \nnow.\n  I rise in strong support of Senator Vitter's amendment, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of it. I think this amendment crystalizes the \nwhole debate we are having in the Senate on this bill. It all comes \ndown to the simple question of whether you oppose or you favor amnesty.\n  I think the way Senators vote on this amendment will tell you where \nthey stand on this issue, so I hope the American people will take \ncareful note of how every Senator in this body votes on this amendment. \nI am in favor of a comprehensive immigration reform bill. The way I see \nit, there are three areas that must be addressed in accomplishing \ncomprehensive reform. The first and foremost is border security. If we \ndo not have operational control of our borders and serious interior \nworksite enforcement, then there is no point in trying to address the \nother issues relative to comprehensive reform.\n  The second key component we must address is to have a viable \ntemporary guestworker program for those outside of the country who want \nto come to this country and work in a job that needs to be filled that \ncannot, or will not, be filled by an American worker.\n  The third component we must address is the reality of the 11 million, \n12 million--whatever the number is--of illegal immigrants who are \ncurrently in the United States.\n  I think we can address all three of these issues without providing a \nnew path to citizenship for those who are currently here illegally. \nThere have been a number of alternative approaches mentioned throughout \nthis debate. I had one for agricultural workers, for example, which \nwould have allowed those workers to remain working for a period of 2 \nyears before returning to their home country and have them reenter the \nUnited States on a valid and viable guest worker program. This would \nallow employers to structure their workforce in a way that they can \nsend their illegal workers home and have them return in a manner that \ndoes not result in a complete work stoppage on our Nation's farms.\n  My main opposition to amnesty is that it has been tried before and it \nhas been proven that it does not work.\n  As chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, my main focus in \nthis debate has been on agricultural workers. I firmly believe that an \namnesty is not in the best interests of agriculture in the United \nStates. The agricultural amnesty in this bill is so similar to the \nSpecial Agricultural Worker Program that was enacted as the mechanism \nfor the 1986 amnesty bill that it is really startling. We have heard \nmany Senators talk about all that illegal aliens have to do in order to \nadjust their status. However, I don't think many people realize that \nthe requirements are not the same for illegal agricultural workers, \nunder the base bill. For illegal agricultural workers to take advantage \nof the amnesty in this bill, they must have worked at least 150 hours \nin agriculture over a 2-year period, ending in December of 2005. \nMeeting that threshold requirement will allow the illegal worker to \nobtain a blue card.\n  Once in possession of a blue card--which is a new process, a new \ncard--that currently illegal worker has a choice of two different paths \nto a green card. In addition to paying back taxes, he can work 100 \nhours per year for 5 years or work 150 hours per year for 3 years and \nget a green card. There is not even a requirement to learn English for \nagricultural workers to take advantage of the amnesty provision in the \nbase bill.\n  I think the requirements for illegal workers to take advantage of the \nagricultural amnesty are so low that I fear a repeat of what happened, \nand failed, in 1986. We should not repeat the mistakes we made before.\n  I am not the only one who feels this way. Several months ago, as we \nwere ramping up toward bringing this bill to the floor, I had the \nopportunity to speak to 135 brand new American citizens who came from \n125 different countries. They were sworn in at the Federal building in \nAtlanta, GA. After my comments to them and their swearing-in ceremony, \nI had about two dozen of these 133 individuals come up to me, one at a \ntime, and say: Senator, whatever you do, please don't allow those folks \nwho came into this country illegally to get a pathway to citizenship \nthat is different from the path I had to follow.\n  In some instances, these individuals took 5 years; in some instances \n8; in some instances 12. In one instance, 22 years that individual had \nto work to become a citizen of the United States. For all 133 of those \nindividuals who stood up that morning and raised their right hand and \nswore to uphold the Constitution of the United States, it was \nthe proudest day of their lives. You can understand why they do not \nwant somebody who came into this country illegally to get a leg up on \npeople who were in the position that they were in for so many years, \ntrying to earn citizenship.\n\n  The people I saw at that naturalization ceremony truly did earn their \ncitizenship, and it means something to them, as it should to everybody \nwho becomes an American citizen. It does not seem fair to me to call \nthe process those newly naturalized individuals followed earned \ncitizenship and also call the provision for illegal agricultural \nworkers in this bill earned citizenship. There is a fundamental \ndifference between the two that should be recognized in the rhetoric of \nthis debate.\n  Another problem I have with the agricultural amnesty provision is \nthat it does not remedy the problem with fraud that was prevalent in \nthe 1986 Special Agricultural Worker Program. Under the 1986 program, \nillegal farm workers who did at least 90 days of farm work during a 12-\nmonth period could earn a legal status. The illegal immigrants had to \npresent evidence that they did at least 90 days of farm work, such as \npay stubs or a letter from an employer or even fellow workers. Because \nit was assumed that many unauthorized farm workers were employed by \nlabor contractors, who did not keep accurate records, after a farm \nworker had presented evidence that he had done qualifying farm work, \nthe burden of proof shifted to the Government to disprove the claimed \nwork.\n  The Government was not prepared for the flood of SAW applicants and \nhad little expertise on typical harvesting seasons. Therefore, an \napplicant who told a story such as: I\n\n[[Page S4670]]\n\nclimbed a ladder to pick strawberries, had that application denied, \nwhile those who said: I picked tomatoes for 92 days in an area with a \npicking season of only 72 days was able to adjust.\n  Careful analysis of the sample of applications from the 1986 worker \nprogram in California, where most applications were filed, suggests \nthat most applicants had not done the qualifying farm work, but over 90 \npercent were nonetheless approved.\n  The propensity for fraud is not remedied in this bill and compounds \nbad policy with the ability for unscrupulous actors to take advantage \nof it.\n  I think the most important lesson to learn from the 1986 program is \nthat providing illegal immigrants who work on the farms of this country \ndoes not benefit the agricultural workforce for long. History shows \nthat the vast majority of illegal workers who gain a legal status leave \nagriculture within 5 years. This means that under proposed agricultural \namnesty, those who questionably performed agricultural work in the past \nwill work at least 100 or 150 hours in agriculture per year for the \nnext 3 to 5 years. But after that, particularly in light of the changes \nmade to the H-2A program, I expect us to be in the same situation in \nagriculture that we are today.\n  It is worth noting that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of \n1986 created a Commission on Agricultural Workers, an 11-member \nbipartisan panel comprised of growers, union representatives, \nacademics, civil servants, and clergy, and tasked it with examining the \nimpact the amnesty for special agricultural workers had on the domestic \nfarm labor supply, working conditions, and wages.\n  Mr. President, I ask for an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. VITTER. I have no objection and will be happy to grant the \nSenator an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the time situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 12 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 12 minutes--\nthe other side has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Back 6 years after the Immigration Reform and Control \nAct was passed, the Commission found that the same problems in the \nagricultural industry persist; the living and working conditions of \nfarm workers had not improved; wages remained stagnant; increasing \nnumbers of new illegal aliens are arriving to compete for the same \nsmall number of jobs, thus reducing the work hours available to each \nworker and contributing to lower annual earnings; and virtually all \nworkers who hold seasonal agricultural jobs are unemployed at some \npoint during the year.\n\n  I think the experience of the SAW program should serve as a lesson to \nthe Senate as we grapple with how to handle our current illegal \npopulation. I believe the amnesty in this bill is far too similar to \nthe SAW Program in 1986 and will likely have the same result.\n  We know from past experience that agricultural workers do not stay in \ntheir agricultural jobs for long, especially when they gain a legal \nstatus and have the option to work in less back-breaking occupations. \nTherefore, the focus on agricultural immigration should be on the H-2A \nprogram. This is the program that regardless of what the Senate does \nwith amnesty, will be relied upon by our agricultural employers across \nthe country in the near future.\n  Let me conclude by saying that while I do support a lot of the \nprovisions in the underlying bill, there is one basic concept in the \nunderlying bill that is baffling to me; that is, why do we have to \nconnect a pathway to citizenship for those who are here illegally to \nmeaningful immigration reform? There are a lot of these people--whether \nit is 11 million or 20 million, whatever the number may be--who came \nhere for the right reason, that reason being to improve the quality of \nlife for themselves and their families. We need to show compassion for \nthose individuals.\n  Does that mean we ought to give them an automatic pass to citizenship \nthat they may, or may not, want? We have no idea how many of these \npeople will actually want to be citizens. Why do we grant that \nprivilege which we cherish so much and those 133 individuals in \nAtlanta, GA, cherished so much on the day they were sworn in as \nAmerican citizens? Why don't we simply leave the law on citizenship \nexactly the way it is today and let people who want to earn it earn it \nin the way that current law provides?\n  Let us look out for these 11 million or 12 million or whatever the \nnumber is. We have methods by which we can deal with those individuals \nand at the same time accomplish real, meaningful border security, as \nwell as provide our employers in this country with a meaningful, \nquality supply of workers that they know are here for the right reasons \nand that they know are here legally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts for his continued leadership. I don't \nbelieve there is anyone in the Senate who has worked harder or done \nmore or who understands the issue better than Senator Kennedy.\n  We are dealing with a very complicated, difficult issue. It is \ncomplicated and difficult for many reasons. Partly it is complicated \nand difficult because we have deferred this issue for years. We have \nrefused to take a responsible position on all the different aspects of \nimmigration reform.\n  I hear with interest from some colleagues that 11 million to 12 \nmillion illegal aliens don't deserve a pathway to legal status and \nultimately citizenship. They, however, do not come forward with \nalternatives. Obviously, border security is the core, the beginning of \nimmigration reform. I am not aware of any Senator who has questioned or \ncontested that point.\n  In fact, the underlying bill that we are debating today is replete--\nabsolutely--in its focus on border security, enforcement of that \nborder, doubling the border agents, doubling the budget, doubling the \nunmanned vehicles, doubling the technology, doing more in the fencing \nand physical protection of those borders.\n  That is not the debate. The debate, of course, resides around the \ndifficult issues, the 11 or 12 million illegals now in this country.\n  This debate elicits great and deep emotions and passion--and it \nshould. We were sent here to deal with the great challenges of our \ntime, to resolve the issues, find solutions, not give speeches, not go \nhalfway--just if we had a better border, if we could enforce our border \nin stronger or more effective ways, and the rest of it just sorts its \nway out. It doesn't sort itself out. That is leadership. That is what \nyou saw from President Bush Monday night in his speech of 17 minutes; \nhe laid it out clearly, succinctly. The American people could \nunderstand it.\n  It is a national security issue. It is an economic issue. It is a \nsocietal issue. You can take pieces of each and pick and choose which \nmight make you more comfortable politically, but it doesn't work that \nway. It is all wrapped into the same enigma. It is woven into the same \nfabric. That is what we are dealing with.\n  On this issue of amnesty, I find it astounding that my colleagues who \nare straight-faced would stand up and talk about amnesty. Let me tell \nyou what amnesty is. Some of you might recall 1978 when President Jimmy \nCarter pardoned those who fled this country, who refused to serve their \ncountry in Vietnam--unconditional forgiveness. That, my friend, is \namnesty. This is not amnesty. So let us get the terms right.\n  The American people deserve an honest debate and exchange. Come on, \nlet's stop the nonsense. If you have a better answer, step forward and \ngive me a better answer for it. But let us at least be honest with the \nAmerican people in what we are talking about. This is not amnesty. You \nall know what we are talking about. This is dealing with a set of \ncriteria that people would have to follow in order to just get on a \npathway.\n  Let me ask this question: Are we better off just to continue to defer \nthis\n\n[[Page S4671]]\n\nand not allow the illegals in this country an opportunity to step out \nof the shadows? Who wins? Is it really protecting the security of this \ncountry? Is it really doing more in the way of enhancing our economy \nand our society to keep pushing these people back into the shadows? \nWhere are we winning? How is this getting to the point, to the issue? \nHow is this dealing with the issue that we must deal with? It is not. \nIt is not.\n  I said this is a complicated, difficult issue. It is. There is not a \nperfect solution, or any solution we can come up with which is \nimperfect. Most solutions are imperfect. Most are imperfect. But it is \ngoing to take some courage from this body.\n  I don't think the American public sees a great abundance of courage \nin this town, in this Congress, in politicians today. Read the front \npage of the Washington Post today and read any poll.\n  But in this case, the President and the Congress are showing some \ncourage to step forward in the middle of a difficult political year, \nwhere my own party, the President's party, is divided on this issue. \nBut this is courage and leadership. It is leadership to take on the \ntough issues. What we are trying to do today and tomorrow and next week \nis find the common ground of responsible governance to deal with this \nissue.\n  This is one of those issues which tests and defines a society. It \ntests and defines a country. And the precious glue that has been \nindispensable in holding this country together for over 200 years has \nbeen common interests and mutual respect. I don't know of an issue that \nis facing our country today that is more important, that is framed in \nthat precious glue concept more precisely than this issue.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote against the Vitter amendment. It is \nirresponsible. It doesn't present an alternative. I think what we have \nbefore us is an alternative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his \nexcellent presentation. He laid out as effectively as one could the \nreasons against this amendment. Effectively, the Vitter amendment \nundermines the whole concept of a comprehensive immigration bill. But \nhaving said that, it is not a constructive or positive solution to the \nchallenges we are facing with the 11 million or 12 million undocumented \nindividuals who are here at the present time.\n  First of all, our bill says if you are going to be able to earn \ncitizenship, you have to pay a penalty. So you have to pay the penalty. \nYou have to be continuously employed. You have to meet a security \nbackground check. You must learn English. You must learn U.S. History. \nYou must pay all back taxes, and then you get in the back of the line \nof all of the applicants waiting for green cards. Effectively, it takes \n11 years for them to be able to earn citizenship. That is the earned \nlegalization program.\n  For those who say this is 1986, they are either distorting the record \nor haven't read it clearly. This is what we are talking about for those \n11 million or 12 million people: They have to earn it--the end of the \nline, pay the penalty, work hard.\n  We have seen some of them join the Armed Forces of our country. That \nis the earned legalization.\n  What is Senator Vitter's answer? Do you know what is going to happen? \nYou are going to have the 11 million or 12 million individuals continue \nto be exploited in the workplace. You are going to drive down the wages \nand, therefore, undermine working conditions for Americans. They are \ngoing to be exploited. They are going to be threatened in the \nworkplace: If you do not do this job that I am asking you to do, I am \ngoing to call the immigration service and have you deported.\n  They are threatened. That is happening every single day all across \nthis country to these individuals.\n  Third, if you are a woman you are going to suffer exploitation, you \nare going to suffer abuse, and you are going to suffer sexual \nharassment. That is the record. Those are the things that are \nhappening, and at the end of the day you are going to have a two-tiered \nsociety. That is something that we, as Americans, have avoided. We take \npride that we are a singular society and we struggle to create equality \nfor all the people of our society.\n  If you accept the Vitter amendment, you are going to have a two-\ntiered society; that is, a permanent underclass. That is the United \nStates of America. That is going to be the result if we are going to \nfollow the recommendations. There is even the suggestion it was going \nto be for deportation.\n  We have heard different approaches to these 12 million. Our friends \nin the House of Representatives have effectively wanted to criminalize \nevery 1 of these 12 million. We are going to criminalize them and stain \nthem for the rest of their lives. We have rejected that.\n\n  We have, on the one hand, people prepared to play by the rules. By \nand large, these are the people who are devoted to their families, who \nwant to work hard, who want to play by the rules. There are 70,000 \npermanent residents now serving in the Armed Forces in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and around the world, willing to do so. Many of them have \ndied in Iraq and Afghanistan. They are prepared to do so. They want to \nbe part of the American dream, as our forebears from other \nnationalities have been part of the American dream. They want to \nparticipate. We are saying to them, that is the choice: a permanent \nsubclass, permanent underclass, permanent exploitation of 11 million or \n12 million, or have them earn their way, go to the back of the line, \nshow they are going to be good citizens, learn English, pay their back \ntaxes, and demonstrate they are committed to the American dream.\n  That is the choice we have made. That is the choice which is clearly \nin the interest of our country. That would be altered and changed and \ndramatically undermined with the Vitter amendment. I hope it is not \naccepted.\n  I withhold whatever time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, quickly, while Senator Vitter is speaking \nfor a lot of people who believe we should not do this together, we \nshould have border security and come back and look at a different way \nof doing this with 11 or 12 million people, that does not mean you are \nhateful, that does not mean you don't understand there is a problem. \nThey have a problem with the citizenship path, and I understand that.\n  I agree with the President, Senator Martinez, Senator Hagel, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Kennedy, 70 percent of the American people--we have to \ndo both. We are not going to put everybody in jail. That is off the \ntable. It is not going to work. We are not going to deport 11 million \nor 12 million people. What do we do? Of these 11 or 12 million people, \nhow many have children who are American citizens? How do you get them \nout of the shadows effectively to get control of the problem?\n  If we want to control the borders, control employment. If we do not \ncontrol employment, we can build the biggest fence in the world, and it \nwill not work. People will keep coming here until we get a grip on \nemployment.\n  How do you control employment? Make sure you know who is being \nemployed, and punish employers who cheat. Give them a chance to \nparticipate in the system that will work. The way to control employment \nis get people out of the shadows, sign up for a system we can control.\n  If you make them felons, they are not going to come out of the \nshadows. If you deport the parents and leave the children behind, they \nare not coming out.\n  If you think it is silly not to beef up the border, you are right. If \nyou think it is wise to separate these issues and have a system where \nno one will participate by punishing people for coming out of the \nshadows, you are dead wrong. You can punish them in a fairminded way \nafter they come out of the shadows, with an incentive for them to come, \nput them on probation. We are talking about a nonviolent offense.\n  We need the workers. We have 4.7 percent unemployment. We have 11 \nmillion people here working. They are not putting people out of work; \nthey are adding value to our country. Some\n\n[[Page S4672]]\n\nwill make it to citizenship, some won't. Those who make it will have \nlearned to speak English and will always have a job for 45 days. They \nwill have a hard road but will have earned it if they get to the end. \nAnd some will not make it.\n  To deny they exist and to have a solution that will not get control \nof employment is just as irresponsible as not doing something about the \nborder. That is why the President has chosen to get involved with a \ncomprehensive solution that does two things at once--controls the \nemployment and does something about the 11 million in a fairminded \nway--and also controls the border. If we separate these issues, we will \nfail again as a country.\n  I look forward to passing a bill that does both--deals with the \nemployment problems, the border problems, and treats people fairly, \npunishes them fairly, and makes them pay their debt to society fairly. \nBut I believe deep in my heart that some of the 11 million people will \nmake it and some won't. They can add value to my country. And my friend \nfrom Florida is a value to my country, and he was not born here.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise in agreement and opposition to \nthe Vitter amendment.\n  I must say I am delighted that the President on Monday sort of laid \nout the game plan. He laid out the vision. The vision is of a strong \nborder, one that secures admittance into the country and does not \npermit illegal entry but understands we have a dynamic country, that we \nhave a growing economy, that we have employment needs which today are \nbeing met by what is largely, in terms of this force, illegally here.\n  The fact is, we have tried to craft a compromise, which is what \nSenator Hagel and I added to what was excellent work by Senator Specter \nin his work, and Senators McCain and Kennedy, who earlier than that \ncame up with a concept to create a two- or three-tier system for those \nalready here.\n  For those 10 million people who are in our country illegally working, \nthose people need to be treated differently. We set up a three-tier \nsystem. Five years and more, and you are more established, you have \nbeen here a long time. The President talked about this on Monday night. \nHe spoke of this very concept. Those people would have one path to \npermanency and to earn legalization very much along the lines of what \nSenator Kennedy described--step after step after step.\n  Those who have been here less than 5 years but more than 2 years have \nto reenter the country legally. They have to go to an entry point and \ncome back in legally. We will then know who they are. As a matter of \nfact, when those people do that, they then go back in and have the same \nrequirements of those who have been here more than 10 years before they \nget a green card or before they become citizens. Then there are those \nmore recent arrivals, and they do not get a benefit from the bill. \nThose are people who presumably have only come in the last couple of \nyears to take advantage of what is currently perceived to be an \nopportunity.\n\n  As to all of those people, who are they and what are they doing? In \nmy State of Florida, they are working in agriculture, they are working \nin construction, and they are working in a number of other enterprises. \nThey are working in the tourism industry. They are building homes. If \nyou are a home builder in Florida, you depend on this labor force and \nthese workers to be there. You depend on them for you to make a good \nliving, for your company to prosper, for your economy to continue to \ngrow. In Florida, we virtually have no unemployment. In fact, we have \nlabor shortages in some sectors of our economy. These demands are being \nmet by this illegal system.\n  What we seek to do in this bill is to create a legal system, a system \nthat can be compatible with our ideals and concepts of a nation of laws \nand also a nation that has for so many years been a nation that has \nwelcomed immigrants. I am proud to be among them.\n  I understand the opportunity the American dream can provide to us \nall. I am very mindful of the openness and the love I felt in this \ncountry by the welcoming of people here who allowed me to make a way \nmyself. This is what we are seeking for these people. After a long and \nprojected trajectory, they have a path to citizenship. They, too, will \nhave a stake in this country. They will have a stake in the outcome. We \nare not relegating them to a second-class citizenship; we are welcoming \nthem as part of the whole.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 5 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is all the time that remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes 45 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Louisiana because it makes enormous changes in the committee bill \nby eliminating the citizenship track.\n  I understand the point of the Senator from Louisiana. He does not \nwant to see the 11 million undocumented immigrants on the citizenship \ntrack. But I believe we should not have a fugitive class in America, \nthat it is necessary, in order to bring these immigrants out of the so-\ncalled shadows--they are out of the shadows for many purposes, and they \nare identifiable, working constructively in the American economy--to \nhave them come forward, we are going to have to provide incentives for \nthem to do so.\n  We have had a great deal of debate on whether there is amnesty in the \ncommittee bill. My own view is that we ought to tone down the rhetoric \non that subject, not accuse one side of amnesty, trying to give away \nsomething that ought not to be given away, and in return not charging \nthat amnesty is an evil argument.\n  We ought to deal with what the facts are. The issue is whether it is \nin our national interest, considering all the factors, to grant \ncitizenship to these 11 million undocumented immigrants when they go to \nthe end of the line if they perform certain tasks, if they meet certain \ncriteria. The criteria are substantial and onerous: the payment of a \nfine, the payment of back taxes, the criminal background checks, \nlearning English, the learning of American history, working a \nsubstantial period of time, and then 6 more years at the end of the \nline.\n  In a very realistic way, there is not really a lot of choice as to \nwhat we are going to do. It is totally impractical and unrealistic to \nthink about deporting 11 million people. The question is, What do we do \nwith them? How do we handle them?\n  It has been said in the Senate repeatedly but not too often that we \nare a nation of immigrants. Many of the Senators who speak start off by \nreferencing their own backgrounds, as I have.\n  My father came to this country in 1911 at the age of 18. He came from \nczarist Russia. The czar wanted to send him to Siberia. As I have said \nin the past, he chose Kansas. It was, perhaps, a close call, I say in a \nfacetious way. My mother came at the age of 6 with her family, settled \nin St. Joe, MO, and my parents have contributed to the American way of \nlife. My father served in World War I and was wounded in action. In my \nSenate office, I proudly have their wedding picture. He was in uniform, \nand she was a beautiful bride of 19. They raised four children who \ncontributed to our country and many grandchildren and many great-\ngrandchildren and many great-great-grandchildren, so far.\n  This situation is a test of our humanity as a nation and the values \nin which we believe in the United States. We do not condone the \nbreaking of the law, the breaking of the rule of law, but we are \ndealing with a very difficult situation in the best way we can.\n  With respect to the Senator from Louisiana, if his amendment were \nagreed to, we would not have comprehensive immigration reform. I \nbelieve comprehensive immigration reform is what is needed.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the final minute for perhaps some \nrebuttal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. In closing the debate on this amendment, I thank all of \nthe Members who have participated on both sides. It is a very important \ndebate.\n  I wish to make three closing points.\n  First of all, I find it a little bit amusing and quite telling, the \nextreme reaction that erupted from some of the\n\n[[Page S4673]]\n\nSenators at my suggestion that this is amnesty. It sort of reminds me \nof the famous line ``Thou doth protest too much.''\n  I offered a textbook definition of amnesty, and I heard no rebuttal \nto the fact that these provisions match that definition. Here is an \neven better definition from ``Black's Law Dictionary,'' which \nspecifically cites as an example:\n\n       The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided \n     amnesty for undocumented aliens already present in the \n     country.\n\n  What is the comparison between that 1986 act and this bill? The \ncomparison is laid out, and it is very striking. Penalties were there \nin both cases. Learning English? Guess what. That was required in 1986. \nWorking in a job for certain periods of time? Guess what. That was in \n1986 as well. The parallels, the comparison is striking.\n  Second, again, it is a straw man to suggest there is absolutely no \nway to deal with the 12 million illegal aliens presently in the country \nbut the provisions of this bill. There are alternatives. I laid out an \nalternative. Senator Chambliss laid out an alternative offering these \nfolks the ability to work as temporary workers but not an automatic \nguaranteed path to citizenship.\n  This is not about whether we deal with the problem; this is about how \nwe deal with the problem. And amnesty, in my opinion, is exactly the \nwrong way to deal with the problem. Recent history has proven that.\n  Third, and finally, I do not offer this amendment ignoring the values \nbehind American citizenship, ignoring the enormous devotion to those \nvalues that so many Americans have, perhaps most of all those who have \nrecently become American citizens. I offer this amendment because of \nthose values and my commitment to honor them because I truly believe \nthe provisions of this bill, which amount to amnesty, will erode the \nconcept of citizenship and will erode those very values.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the essence of the argument from the \nSenator from Louisiana is when he says ``automatic guaranteed path to \ncitizenship.'' Well, it simply is not so. There is nothing automatic \nwhen you have to fulfill the requirements of paying a fine and learning \nEnglish and paying back taxes and working for a protracted period of \ntime. There is nothing guaranteed about it. It is earned. And that is \nthe hallmark of American values: to earn it.\n  That concludes my argument, Mr. President.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as soon as Senator Kennedy returns to the \nfloor, I will make it official on asking unanimous consent locking in \nthe two votes at 2:30.\n  I am informed there is agreement by authorized representatives of the \nleader of the Democrats. And we are now awaiting the arrival of Senator \nObama, who is reportedly due here momentarily.\n  So until he arrives, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized \nfor 2 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on the Vitter amendment, I thank Senator \nVitter for his amendment. Yesterday, Senator Dorgan offered an \namendment to remove the guest worker program in its entirety, and I \nsupported that because I believed it was flawed. Eventually, last \nnight, we came back with an amendment that pretty much fixed it, that \nwhole guest worker program, which I thought was good.\n  I think Senator Vitter's amendment points out and allows us to focus \non the fact that this amnesty provision in the bill or regularization \nprovision in the bill--whatever the fair way to describe it is--also \nhas serious flaws. By supporting this amendment, it would be my \nintention to say let's make it better because I do believe we are not \ngoing to reject the people who are here and try to eject all of those \npeople who have come illegally. We need to treat them in a decent and \nfair and caring way.\n  But also the rule of law is important. I think we ought not to \ndevelop a procedure that essentially provides every benefit to someone \nwho came illegally that we would provide to those who come legally. So \nI will be supporting the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when we complete debate on Senator \nObama's amendment, we will then have two votes at 2:30. And then, after \nthe votes, it is our desire, subject to Senator Inhofe's agreement, to \ncome and debate his amendment. That may take a substantial period of \ntime. I am advised by Senator Kennedy they would like 2 hours equally \ndivided. So that will take us fairly far into the afternoon. We will \nstay in session even though Director Negroponte will be having a \nsession upstairs. This bill needs to be moved, so we will stay in \nsession on the Inhofe amendment during that period of time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Idaho be \ngiven 2 minutes to debate the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I do have to stand in opposition to the \nVitter amendment and hope my colleagues will oppose it. We are all \nfinding out that what we are attempting to do is phenomenally \ncomplicated, with all the different kinds of categories of work status \nand reality that we as the Senate and the American people are awakening \nto.\n  There is one reality. We have a lot of undocumented foreign nationals \nin our country. By definition, they are illegal. Some--and many--have \nbeen here 5 and 6 years or more or less. They are law abiding. They are \nhard working. They have not violated the laws, other than they walked \nacross the border. And they did violate a law when they did that.\n\n  Earned adjustment is an attempt to bring some reality to this by \nsaying, if you have been here and you worked a while, then you can stay \nand work: You will pay a fine, you will have a background check, but we \nwill provide you with a legal status to stay and to work--not \ncitizenship. If you want citizenship, you go to the back of the line \nand you qualify.\n  But we are talking about a legal work status. Some call that amnesty. \nI call it earned adjustment because we are beginning to find out who is \nhere, why they are here. There is a background check. Are they legal in \nthe sense, did they violate laws, other than walking across the border? \nAnd I do not mean to take that lightly.\n  The Vitter amendment wipes out all of that. It wipes out the work of \nthe committee. It wipes out how you deal with 10 million undocumented \npeople in our country in a systematic, legal, and responsible fashion.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Vitter amendment. There may be a \nbetter idea than earned adjustment. But after having worked on this \nissue for 5 years and attempting to work with all of the interest \ngroups to bring about some equity, stability of workforce--assuring \nthat those who are out in the field now working or in our processing \nplants working can stay and work and keep our economy moving--I ask my \ncolleagues to oppose the Vitter amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 we \nproceed to the Sessions amendment for a\n\n[[Page S4674]]\n\n15-minute vote, and thereafter we proceed to the Vitter amendment for a \n10-minute vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have Senator Obama on the floor ready \nto offer his amendment. There is some issue as to whether it has been \nworked through on all of the aspects of being modified. But I think we \nare very close. So what I would suggest we do is proceed to consider \nthe Obama amendment, subject to some minor change which may be made on \nmodification. And I ask unanimous consent that the time be equally \ndivided between now and 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The time between now and 2:30 \nwill be equally divided.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3971, as Modified\n\n  Mr. President, while the staff is consulting--we thought that the \nmodifications had been agreed to--what I would like to do is tell you \nthe essence of the amendment that I plan to offer. As soon as we get \nthe go-ahead, we will offer it for immediate consideration.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss amendment No. 3971, which \npertains to the guest worker provisions in the bill. I have some \nsignificant concerns with respect to the guest worker provisions. I am \nconcerned that the guest worker provisions are premised on the idea \nthat American workers are not available to fill the jobs that are \ncurrently being filled by undocumented workers or foreign guest \nworkers. I am not certain that is the case.\n  Recently, I was on vacation in Arizona. I was staying at a hotel, and \nI noticed that all the individuals who were serving drinks and lunch at \nthe swimming pool appeared to be from the West Indies. So I asked one \nof them: Where are you from? He said: I am from Jamaica. I asked: Are \nall the guys here from Jamaica? He said: Yes. I asked: How do you come \nhere? He said: Well, I work for a company that essentially brings us in \nfor 9 months during the high season. Then during the low season of \nvacation we will go back. And they take care of all their paperwork and \nhandle all their immigration issues.\n  And he said: Did you notice that all the women who are cleaning the \nrooms are from China? I said: You know, I happened to notice that.\n  It turned out they have the same arrangement.\n  What it indicated was essentially you have a situation in which \ninternational temp agencies are being set up where workers will come in \nfor 9 months, doing jobs that I think many Americans would be willing \nto do if they were available.\n  Now, having said that, there are some industries in which guest \nworkers and agricultural workers are absolutely necessary. So the \nquestion is: How do we create this program but make sure it is tight \nenough that it does not disadvantage workers? To do that we are going \nto have to make the prevailing wage requirements of this bill real for \nall workers and all jobs.\n  We have to ensure that communities where American unemployment rates \nare high will not experience unnecessary competition from guest \nworkers. So to that end, I will be offering an amendment, as modified, \nalong with Senators Feinstein and Bingaman, to strengthen the \nprevailing wage language and to freeze the guest worker program in \ncommunities with unemployment rates for low-skilled workers of 9 \npercent or greater.\n  This amendment would establish a true prevailing wage for all \noccupations to ensure that guest workers are paid a wage that does not \nlower American wages. The bill on the floor requires that employers \nadvertise jobs to American workers at a prevailing wage before offering \nthat job to a guest worker. And it requires that employers pay guest \nworkers a prevailing wage. But the bill, currently, without the \namendment, does not clarify how to calculate the prevailing wage for \nworkers not covered by a collective bargaining agreement or the Service \nContract Act of 1965, which governs contracts entered into by the \nFederal Government. That leaves most jobs and most workers unprotected.\n  The bill currently before us simply states that an employer has to \nprovide working conditions and benefits such as those provided to \nworkers ``similarly'' employed. So as a consequence, a bad employer \ncould easily game the system by offering an artificially low wage to \nAmerican workers and just count on those workers not taking the job. \nThe employer could then offer that job at below-average wages to guest \nworkers, knowing they would take it to get here legally.\n  That is not good for American workers, and it is not good for guest \nworkers.\n  My amendment fixes that language. It directs the employer to use \nDepartment of Labor data to calculate a prevailing wage in those cases \nin which neither a collective bargaining agreement nor the Service \nContract Act applies. That would mean an employer would have to make an \noffer at an average wage across comparable employers instead of just an \naverage wage that she or he is willing to pay. The amendment also would \nestablish stronger prohibitions on the guest worker program in high \nunemployment areas. The bill currently bars use of the program if the \nunemployment rate for low-skilled workers in a metropolitan area \naverages more than 11 percent. Our amendment would lower that \nunemployment rate to 9 percent of workers unemployed with a high school \ndiploma or less. There is no reason any community with large pockets of \nunemployed Americans needs guest workers.\n  This is a good, commonsense amendment which is endorsed by SEIU, the \nLaborers Union, the AFL-CIO Building and Construction Trades \nDepartment, and the National Council of La Raza. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I will actually call up the amendment to be read as soon as it comes \nback. I think there are some discussions taking place right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are still working on a modification. I \nam advised that it is a minor modification, but until we get it, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Illinois for \nbringing this to the attention of the Senate. I rise in strong support \nof the amendment. One of the dynamics of a comprehensive approach is \nlegality and fairness. What we want to make sure is that when jobs are \nadvertised for Americans first, Americans should be able to take \nadvantage of the opportunity. But if they are going to go, by and \nlarge, to Hispanic individuals who come here, they ought to be treated \nat fair wages. There are protections that are included in the bill at \nthe present time. The amendment offered by the Senator from Illinois \naddresses that issue and strengthens it. I hope we will find a way to \naccept it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we have been having some discussion. My \nunderstanding is that the concerns that have been raised have to do \nwith the underlying bill and not my amendment. As a consequence, I ask \nunanimous consent to send to the desk amendment No. 3971, as modified, \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to add Senators Lieberman and Landrieu \nas cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting the pending \namendments aside?\n  Without objection, the pending amendments are set aside. Does the \nSenator have a modified version?\n  Mr. OBAMA. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S4675]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Obama], for himself, Mrs. \n     Feinstein, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Lieberman, and Ms. Landrieu, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3971, as modified.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To amend the temporary worker program)\n\n       Beginning on page 266, strike line 13 and all that follows \n     through 267, line 3, and insert the following:\n       ``(C) Prevailing wage level.--For purposes of subparagraph \n     (A)(ii), the prevailing wage level shall be determined in \n     accordance as follows:\n       ``(i) If the job opportunity is covered by a collective \n     bargaining agreement between a union and the employer, the \n     prevailing wage shall be the wage rate set forth in the \n     collective bargaining agreement.\n       ``(ii) If the job opportunity is not covered by such an \n     agreement and it is in an occupation that is covered by a \n     wage determination under a provision of subchapter IV of \n     chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code, or the Service \n     Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.), the prevailing \n     wage level shall be the appropriate statutory wage.\n       ``(iii)(I) If the job opportunity is not covered by such an \n     agreement and it is in an occupation that is not covered by a \n     wage determination under a provision of subchapter IV of \n     chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code, or the Service \n     Contract Act of 1965 (41 U.S.C. 351 et seq.), the prevailing \n     wage level shall be based on published wage data for the \n     occupation from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, including the \n     Occupational Employment Statistics survey, Current Employment \n     Statistics data, National Compensation Survey, and \n     Occupational Employment Projections program. If the Bureau of \n     Labor Statistics does not have wage data applicable to such \n     occupation, the employer may base the prevailing wage level \n     on another wage survey approved by the Secretary of Labor.\n       ``(II) The Secretary shall promulgate regulations \n     applicable to approval of such other wage surveys that \n     require, among other things, that the Bureau of Labor \n     Statistics determine such surveys are statistically viable.\n\n       On page 273, line 7, strike ``unskilled and low-skilled \n     workers'' and insert ``workers who have not completed any \n     education beyond a high school diploma''.\n  On page 273, line 9, strike ``11.0'' and insert ``9.0'', and on line \n4, after ``immigrant'', add ``is not agriculture based and''.\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. I already explained the amendment, Mr. President. My \nsuggestion would be that if the manager of the bill has no objection, \nwe go ahead. I want to make sure I am going in the appropriate order, \ngiven the manager's fine job of keeping this process moving.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have no objection to proceeding to \nconsider the amendment, as modified. There are still Senators on this \nside of the aisle reviewing it. We are not yet prepared to take a \nposition. I think it is entirely appropriate to consider the \ndiscussion. I believe, as I said to Senator Obama privately, that we \nwill work it out.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois for further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. As I indicated, this amendment essentially says that the \nprevailing wage provisions in the underlying bill should be tightened \nto ensure that they apply to all workers and not just some workers. The \nway the underlying bill is currently structured, essentially those \nworkers who fall outside of Davis-Bacon projects or collective \nbargaining agreements or other provisions are not going to be covered. \nThat could be 25 million workers or so which could be subject to \ncompetition from guest workers, even though they are prepared to take \nthe jobs that the employers are offering, if they were offered at a \nprevailing wage. My hope would be that we can work out whatever \ndisagreements there are on the other side. This is a mechanism to \nensure that the guest worker program is not used to undercut American \nworkers and to put downward pressure on the wages of American workers.\n  Everybody in this Chamber has agreed that if we are going to have a \nguest worker program, it should only be made available where there is a \ngenuine need that has been shown by the employers that American workers \nare not available for those jobs. Without this amendment, that will not \nbe the case, and we will have a situation in which we have guest \nworkers who are taking jobs that Americans are prepared to take, if, in \nfact, prevailing wages were provided for. I don't know anybody here--\nand I have been working closely with those who are interested in \npassing a bill--who wants to see a situation in which we are creating a \nmechanism to undermine the position of American workers.\n  I ask that this amendment be considered, and I will hold off on \nasking for the yeas and nays until we have had a chance to discuss it \nfurther.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 2:30 \nhaving arrived, the vote is to occur in relation to the Sessions \namendment No. 3979.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the Vitter \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, the yeas and nays have been ordered on \nthe Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reserving the right to object, as I understand, at the \ntime they are going to have the consideration of the Inhofe amendment, \nthere may be a side-by-side amendment, and I hope that perhaps we would \nmove to Inhofe. I would also hope that the Senator might withhold his \nunanimous consent request, at least until we have the full package, so \nthat the Senate understands exactly the way we are going to proceed.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I would like to explain my reasons for my \nvote on the Vitter amendment No. 3963.\n  It is estimated that there are currently around 12 million illegal \nimmigrants in this country. And I do not support the proposition that \neveryone of those 12 million illegal immigrants currently in the United \nStates should be given the right to a green card and eventual \ncitizenship.\n  However, there are certain cases where illegal immigrants have been \nhere for a very long time--in some cases, for decades. Some of these \npeople have families here and deep ties to their local communities.\n  The Vitter amendment would have made no exception for such cases at \nall. And I do think that we need some flexibility for humanitarian \nreasons.\n  For this reason, I voted against the Vitter amendment. But I would \nlike to emphasize that I am not in favor of a broad, blanket amnesty \nfor illegal immigrants.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4018\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we are ready to go on the \namendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if I could ask the distinguished \nmanager if I, along with Senator Cornyn, could be added as cosponsors \nto Senator Leahy's amendment since it applies to both the northern and \nsouthern borders?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have no objection to that. It fairly \nstates it. This would apply to both borders and, of course, simply \nextends the time after which we have to have the kind of ID that would \nbe called for in previous legislation. It would extend to both the \nnorthern and southern border. I will be glad to have both Senators from \nTexas as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to the Western \nHemisphere Travel Initiative. This initiative is based on the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations and was authorized in ``The Intelligence \nReform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004.'' It requires the \nDepartment of Homeland Security--DHS--to implement a new documentation \nprogram by January 1, 2008. Once this program is in place, all U.S. \ncitizens crossing the Canadian or Mexican border into our country must \nhave a passport or other accepted documentation, such as a passcard, in \norder to verify their citizenship.\n  The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department are now \nin the process of developing the rules needed to implement this \ninitiative. The air and sea portion of this initiative could be \nimplemented as early as next January.\n  The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department are\n\n[[Page S4677]]\n\nevaluating two options for this initiative. The first would require a \nperson entering the United States to present a passport. However, \npassports are expensive and require weeks to acquire. The second option \nis a passcard, which would be slightly cheaper, but would still require \na background check and could only be used for travel between our \ncountry, Canada, and Mexico.\n  We must tighten our border security, but many have raised serious \nconcerns about both of these options. It is unlikely the State \nDepartment will be able to process the flood of requests for passports \nand passcards that will come from this initiative by the deadline. The \ntravel and business activities of millions of people will be adversely \naffected.\n  Take a military family reassigned from the lower 48 to Eielson Air \nForce Base, Alaska. They must drive from the lower 48 through Canada \nwith all of their belongings, and they may not have the opportunity or \nfunds to acquire the passports this initiative will require.\n  Our State is the only State in the Nation which cannot be accessed by \nland without passing through a foreign country. Alaskans are very \nconcerned about the impact this initiative will have on travel to and \nfrom our State.\n  Every year, a large number of people travel to Alaska from the lower \n48 on the Alaska-Canada highway, Also known as the Al-Can. Each summer \nwe routinely see RVs on the road with license plates from New York, \nPennsylvania, Florida, California, and elsewhere. These visitors will \nnow need a passcard or a passport to drive to our State. I worry about \nhow this will affect our tourism industry and the challenges it will \ncreate for Americans who want to visit one of the most beautiful places \nin our country.\n  These are just some of the issues which must be considered before \nimplementing this plan. I believe the department of homeland security \nand the State department are operating under an unrealistic timeframe. \nWe must ensure they have enough time to properly test and implement \nthis system, which includes biometrics and new border security \nequipment.\n  Those of us in Alaska share a special relationship with our friends \nin Canada. It would be unfortunate if a hastily imposed initiative \nnegatively affected movement in and out of Canada, or negatively \naffected our relationship with our neighbors.\n  The deadline Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security is \nfast approaching. Little progress has been made. We must pass this \namendment to give them more time.\n  There is just too much at stake to rush this, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Congress passed the intelligence \nreform bill in 2004, it included measures that were intended to help \nsecure our borders. These provisions, called the Western Hemisphere \nTravel Initiative, require that any person, including a U.S. citizen, \npresent a passport or its equivalent, when they enter the United States \nfrom neighboring countries, including Canada or Mexico.\n  We have long enjoyed less-formal immigration policies with our \nneighbors, and especially with Canada. These policies encourage tourism \nand trade and promote goodwill between our nations.\n  The impact of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative on Northern \nBorder states could be extremely harmful. Last year, Vermont exported \n$1.516 billion worth of products to Canada. And in 2003, more than 2 \nmillion Canadians visited Vermont, spending $188 million while here. \nOther northern border States enjoy similar trade and tourism benefits \nwith Canada and face what could be significant downturns in their \neconomies if this law is not implemented smoothly.\n  States like Alaska and Minnesota have unique challenges under the law \nbecause in Alaska all or in Minnesota some residents have to cross into \nCanada before entering the continental U.S. by land. In addition, \nseveral southern States could experience negative impacts. Florida and \nNevada welcome significant numbers of Canadian tourists. Other States \nhave strong economic ties to Canada and depend on the efficient \nmovement of products across international borders.\n  We all know that the economic health of many small towns along the \nborder depends upon their access to neighboring Canadian towns. In some \ncases, these towns share emergency services, grocery stores and other \nbasic services. Residents sometimes cross the border on foot several \ntimes a day. This is true in Vermont, and I am sure that it is true for \ncommunities in many border States.\n  The State Department is developing a lower cost passport \nalternative--called the PASS Card--but that program has serious \nproblems and potential for delay. The two Government agencies \nresponsible for these PASS Cards are still arguing over what technology \nto embed in the card.\n  This issue alone indicates that DHS cannot meet the January 1, 2008 \ndeadline when all U.S. citizens will need this card, or the more \nexpensive traditional passport, to cross the northern border at land \nports of entry.\n  I have worked in recent months with Senators Stevens, Jeffords, \nColeman, Stabenow, Murkowski, Cornyn and Levin to extend the \nimplementation date for this program to June 2009. That would give the \nU.S. and Canada an extra 18 months to prepare for a smooth transition. \nThe bipartisan amendment we offer today should be non controversial and \nI hope all Senators will support it.\n  No one is suggesting that we should repeal the Western Hemisphere \nTravel Initiative altogether, but in order to protect our economy and \nto preserve community ties, we should intervene now to ensure that the \nGovernment can implement this law in a rational manner. An extension is \nthe sensible way to proceed. We need to be smart about border security, \nnot just to sound ``tough'' about it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are ready to have a voice vote on the \npending Leahy-Stevens amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4018) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4000\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will now ask for consideration of the \nSantorum amendment, amendment No. 4000, which has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself, \n     Mr. Frist, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4000.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To allow additional countries to participate in the visa \nwaiver program under section 217 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n                     if they meet certain criteria)\n\n       On page 306, strike line 13 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 413. VISA WAIVER PROGRAM EXPANSION.\n\n       Section 217(c) (8 U.S.C. 1187(c)) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(8) Probationary admission.--\n       ``(A) Definition of material support.--In this paragraph, \n     the term `material support' means the current provision of \n     the equivalent of, but not less than, a battalion (which \n     consists of 300 to 1,000 military personnel) to Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom to provide \n     training, logistical or tactical support, or a military \n     presence.\n       ``(B) Designation as a program country.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of this section, a country may be \n     designated as a program country, on a probationary basis, \n     under this section if--\n       ``(i) the country is a member of the European Union;\n       ``(ii) the country is providing material support to the \n     United States or the multilateral forces in Afghanistan or \n     Iraq, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State; and\n       ``(iii) the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of State, determines that participation of \n     the country in the visa waiver program under this section \n     does not compromise the law enforcement interests of the \n     United States.\n       ``(C) Refusal rates; overstay rates.--The determination \n     under subparagraph (B)(iii) shall only take into account any \n     refusal rates or overstay rates after the expiration of the \n     first full year of the country's admission into the European \n     Union.\n\n[[Page S4678]]\n\n       ``(D) Full compliance.--Not later than 2 years after the \n     date of a country's designation under subparagraph (B), the \n     country--\n       ``(i) shall be in full compliance with all applicable \n     requirements for program country status under this section; \n     or\n       ``(ii) shall have its program country designation \n     terminated.\n       ``(E) Extensions.--The Secretary of State may extend, for a \n     period not to exceed 2 years, the probationary designation \n     granted under subparagraph (B) if the country--\n       ``(i) is making significant progress towards coming into \n     full compliance with all applicable requirements for program \n     country status under this section;\n       ``(ii) is likely to achieve full compliance before the end \n     of such 2-year period; and\n       ``(iii) continues to be an ally of the United States \n     against terrorist states, organizations, and individuals, as \n     determined by the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with \n     the Secretary of State.''.\n\n     SEC. 414. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I congratulate my cosponsor, Senator \nMikulski, for the excellent work we did as a team on this amendment. It \ntook a long time to work this through the process, but we are very \npleased today this amendment will be accepted.\n  Mr. President, when a country is a staunch defense ally and partner \nin the war on terror, they should have the opportunity to participate \nin the Visa Waiver Program on a probationary basis while they work to \ncome into full compliance. I previously introduced and called up a \nsimilar amendment, No. 3214, cosponsored by Senator Mikulski. After \nconsultation with the Judiciary Committee and the Department of State, \nthis modified version seeks to address some of the concerns that have \nbeen raised.\n   I believe it is time that we allow average citizens from our allies \nin the war on terror to come to the U.S. for weddings, birthdays and \nfunerals without the arbitrary determination of an embassy bureaucrat. \nThis amendment provides an opportunity--just an opportunity--for our \nallies to allow their citizens to visit here for average events that we \nall take for granted. It does not provide an open-ended opportunity, \njust a 2-year window.\n  Any country that meets the probationary criteria then must come into \nfull compliance within 2 years--if not, they are terminated from the \nprogram. This amendment also addressed a particular concern related to \ncertain countries with a Cold War history where even in the post-Cold \nWar era is held accountable for decades-old problems. This provision \nensures that overstay and refusal rates are based on current issues \nafter the country's admission into the European Union, and not its past \nhistory.\n  Finally, the amendment provides a one-time option to the Secretary of \nState to extend a country's probationary status under certain specific \ncriteria. After researching countries that could meet the criteria of \nthe amendment, my staff indicates that the only country currently \nmeeting the eligibility requirements is Poland.\n  Poland has been a strong ally to the United States at a critical time \nin history. Poland was a staunch ally to the U.S. in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. Poland has committed up to 2,300 soldiers to help with ongoing \npeace efforts in Iraq, and currently assumes command of the Multi-\nNational Division--MND--Central South in Iraq. Poland demonstrated its \ncommitment to global security by becoming a member of NATO. Poland also \njust recently became a member of the EU. And in 1991, Poland \nunilaterally repealed the visa requirement for U.S. citizens traveling \nto Poland for less than 90 days. Today, more than 100,000 Polish \ncitizens travel to the United States annually.\n  On February 10, 2005, I introduced S. 348 designating Poland as a \nvisa waiver country, with Senator Mikulski. This bill designates Poland \nas a visa waiver country. Under this amendment, Polish citizens \nvisiting the U.S. within a 90-day period would not need to apply for a \nvisa. Representative Nancy Johnson introduced identical legislation \nMarch 8, 2005 in the House, H.R. 635. Cosponsors of the bill are \nRepresentatives Crowley, Jackson-Lee, Hart, LaHood, Shimkus, Lipinski \nand Weiner.\n  I wrote a letter on February 9, 2005 to Secretary of State Rice \nurging the State Department's support for this legislation. Following \nup on that letter, I had conversations with Secretary Rice in the \nSpring of 2005. Then in February 2006, I again wrote to Deputy \nSecretary Zoellick urging his support for this legislation and offering \nto address any concerns the State Department may have. To date, and \ndespite my staffs continued outreach, they have failed to take us up on \nthe offer.\n\n  So instead of working for a compromise, we continue not to move \nforward on a bill to support the allies that have supported us. On \nAugust 31, 2005 Poland celebrated the 25th anniversary of the 1980 \nshipyard strikes in Gdansk and the creation of the Solidarity Trade \nUnion. I was an original cosponsor of the Senate-passed resolution. The \nSenate passed a resolution commemorating this anniversary. I had the \nincredible privilege of meeting with Lech Walesa in October 2004 upon \nintroduction of my bill designating Poland as a member country of the \nVisa Waiver Program. He is ``the symbol of the solidarity movement.'' \nSince the demise of communism, Poland has become a stable, democratic \nnation. Poland has adopted economic policies that promote free markets \nand economic growth.\n  When President Bush and then-Polish President Kwasniewski met in \nFebruary 2005, they affirmed the goal of Poland entering the Visa \nWaiver Program--VMP, and agreed to a ``roadmap'' of mutual steps to \nadvance this goal in conformity with U.S. legislative criteria. Through \npressure from Congress and advocacy groups this issue has been advanced \nfurther than ever before, making this ``road map'' possible. Although \nthe State Department has assured me it is working hard to implement a \n``clean slate'' so immigration violations before 1989 will not render \nthem ineligible for a U.S. visa, we know that a key element will be the \n2006 review of visa overstay rates based on new 2005 data from Poland's \nfirst year in the EU. Another part of the agreement includes the U.S. \nworking with Poland to meet the visa waiver requirements, particularly \nwith regard to refusal and overstay rates, and exploring the provision \nof technical assistance to bring Poland's passports in compliance. I \nhope the cooperation that has begun will continue in earnest to ensure \nthat Poland comes into full compliance in the 2-year window under this \nprovision.\n  The current roadmap is a step in the right direction, but it \ncontinues to move at a very slow pace. We can and should do more for \nthose that have stepped up to the plate and been incredible allies in \nthe war on terror. Today, as we consider who should be allowed to \nimmigrate to our country and how, we are focused on how to ensure \nsecurity and the rule flaw for those that have come into our country \nillegally. For a moment I propose to turn the discussion to how to help \nthose who have stood with us--indeed those who have fought and died \nwith us--a preferred legal way to obtain a visa to come to this \ncountry.\n  I am here to stand with the Polish people in asking each of you to \nsupport bringing Poland into the Visa Waiver Program. Why is it that \ncountries such as Brunei, Liechtenstein and San Marino are in the Visa \nWaiver Program, but not Poland or other allies in the war on terror? \nPolish troops have fought alongside American and British and Australian \ntroops from day one of the war in Iraq. Just like Congress did in 1996 \nwhen it legislatively brought Ireland in as a full participant in the \nVisa Waiver Program, it is time for us to take a stand and support our \nallies in the war on terror.\n  As a country, we look forward to continuing our strong friendship \nwith Poland and its new President Lech Kaczynski. Is this then a \ncountry that we don't want to allow its citizens to come to this \ncountry? Is this a country we want to say ``thanks for your help'' but \nwe won't help your citizens come to the U.S.? I think there is a better \ncourse of action. Colleagues, this is an to opportunity for us to \nstrengthen that relationship in a real and substantial way. Open a \npathway for those that have supported us to come visit our country. In \nthat way--in this small way--we can reach back the hand of an ally that \nhas reached out to help us in the War on Terror. I urge my colleagues \nto support the Santorum-Mikulski-Frist amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the fight to \nright a wrong in America's visa program. It is time to extend the Visa \nWaiver Program to Poland. I am pleased to have formed bipartisan \npartnership with\n\n[[Page S4679]]\n\nSenator Santorum and Senator Frist to introduce this amendment to get \nit done.\n  In September 2004, Senator Santorum and I met with a hero of the cold \nwar, Lech Walesa. When he jumped over the wall of the Gdansk shipyard, \nhe took Poland and the world with him. He told us that the visa issue \nis a question of honor for Poland. That day we introduced a bill to \nonce again stand in solidarity with the father of Solidarity by \nextending the Visa Waiver Program to Poland.\n  Two months ago, I had the honor of meeting with Poland's new \nPresident, Lech Kaczynski. We reaffirmed the close ties between the \nPolish and American peoples. And we heard loud and clear that the Visa \nWaiver Program remains a high priority for Poland.\n  The people of Poland don't understand, and frankly neither do I, why \nFrance is among the 27 countries of the Visa Waiver Program but Poland \nis not. Poland, whose troops joined us in the opening days of war in \nIraq. Nine hundred Polish troops stand with us there today. Seventeen \nPolish soldiers have been killed in Iraq and 27 wounded. Poland, whose \ntroops are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan, sending 1,000 Polish \nsoldiers to help lead NATO's mission there. The United States is \nblessed with few allies as stalwart as Poland. But we tell a \ngrandmother in Gdansk she needs a visa to visit her grandchildren in \nAmerica.\n  This amendment will allow Poland and any other European Union country \nwith troops in Iraq or Afghanistan today to join the Visa Waiver \nProgram for 2 years on probationary status. It will allow Polish \ncitizens to travel to the U.S. for tourism or business for up to 60 \ndays without needing to stand in line for a visa. Shouldn't we make it \neasier for the Pulaskis and Marie Curies to visit our country?\n  We know our borders will be no less secure because of this amendment. \nBut we know our alliance will be more secure. I thank my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n  I am glad the Santorum-Mikulski amendment is being considered. It \nshows that when we work together we can get a lot done. I thank both \nSenators from Pennsylvania for their help and cooperation to get this \namendment agreed to.\n  This amendment rights a wrong in America's visa program.\n  It is time to extent the visa waiver program to Poland. I am pleased \nto have formed bipartisan partnership with Senator Santorum and Senator \nFrist to get it done.\n  In September 2004, Senator Santorum and I met with the hero of the \ncold war--Lech Walesa. When he jumped over the wall of the Gdansk \nshipyard he took Poland and the world with him. He told us that the \nvisa issue is a question of honor for Poland. That day, we introduced \nbill to once again stand in solidarity and with the father of \nSolidarity by extending the visa waiver program to Poland.\n  Two months ago, I met with Poland's new President, Lech Kaczynski. We \nreaffirmed close ties between the Polish and American peoples. We hear \nloud and clear that the visa waiver program is a high priority for \nPoland.\n  Why is it important?\n  The people of Poland don't understand, and frankly, neither do I, why \nFrance is among the 27 countries of the visa waiver program but Poland \nis not. Poland, whose troops joined us in the opening days of war in \nIraq, has had 900 troops stand with us there today. Mr. President, 17 \nPolish soldiers have been killed in Iraq and 27 were wounded. Polish \ntroops are preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. One thousand Polish \nsoldiers help lead NATO's mission there.\n  The United States is blessed with few allies as stalwart as Poland, \nbut we tell a grandmother in Gdansk she needs a visa to visit her \ngrandchildren in America.\n  What will it do?\n  This amendment will allow Poland and any other EU country with troops \nin Iraq or Afghanistan today to join the visa waiver program for 2 \nyears on probationary status.\n  It will allow Polish citizens to travel to the United States for \ntourism or business for up to 60 days without needing to stand in line \nfor a visa.\n  Shouldn't we make it easier for the Pulaskis and Marie Curies to \nvisit our country? We know our borders will be no less secure because \nof this amendment, but we know our alliance will be more secure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4000) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think we are prepared to go with the \namendment by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn. I ask unanimous \nconsent that we have a 2-hour time agreement on the Cornyn amendment \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, it is my \nunderstanding that we have under unanimous consent my amendment and \nthen a Democratic amendment and then the Ensign amendment. Is the \nSenator talking about changing that order?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am talking about changing the order. \nWhen the Senator from Oklahoma and I last talked, Senator Kyl had asked \nfor more time and there were discussions. It is my understanding that \nwe were trying to work through to simplify the action once it got to \nthe floor. My interest is finding an amendment which I can bring to the \nfloor and debate and vote. I am prepared to go any direction \npracticable to achieve that. We now have Senator Vitter on the floor \nwho has another amendment. But may we hear from the Senator from \nOklahoma as to what his concerns are?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe we are ready with our amendment, \nand under the unanimous consent we would be next. We are making some \nmodifications right now. We could use a little time. We are ready to go \nin our place in line, unless it works out by unanimous consent that \nSenator Ensign and I change places so that my amendment would come up \nafter the next Democratic amendment. That is what I will be willing to \ndo.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we stay on the current unanimous consent \nrequest, with the exception that Senator Ensign's amendment be traded \nwith mine, and I will take his place after the next amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \nbeen ready to go, urging relatively short time agreements. We have a \nwhole series of proposals from that side and virtually none from here. \nThis has been sort of a jump ball. We are trying to adopt to that. We \nhave a Democratic amendment that we are prepared to go to. I am more \nthan glad to work out with the floor manager as to time limits. The \nCornyn amendment we had not expected would come up. It reaches the \nheart of the issue, and our side needs at least an hour for it. I know \nthe Inhofe amendment has been a matter that has been discussed. We were \ntrying to work out a time agreement for consideration of a side-by-\nside. There has been a good deal of discussion and desire to try to \nwork out a relatively limited amount of time. We are not interested in \nprolonging that discussion and debate. I think people would like some \ntime to try to figure that out. I think when they have that, we could \nhave a relatively short period of time for the consideration of it. I \nam familiar with the Ensign amendment. Senator Vitter and Senator \nCornyn have amendments. We are prepared to have a short time agreement.\n  Our concern is that we have a whole series of Republican amendments, \nand we are not having Democratic amendments. We want to try to work \nthis thing through. We have had a short time. I have every intention of \nsuggesting to our side that we have short\n\n[[Page S4680]]\n\ntimes. But we need to at least try to work out with the floor manager \nsome opportunity for the consideration of our side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, do I understand the Senator from \nMassachusetts to mean he would be prepared to go, if we revert to the \noriginal schedule, with Senator Inhofe and take the Inhofe amendment \nnow under a time agreement?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am glad to do the Inhofe amendment. I \nunderstand there is going to be a side-by-side, but I can't enter into \na time agreement on that until that thing is finished. I know what the \nSenator's amendment is. I know people want to debate it. But in terms \nof limiting the time, until we have the side-by-side, I cannot enter \ninto a time agreement. When we have a side-by-side, we would enter into \na short time agreement--I think an hour or an hour and half evenly \ndivided. There isn't any desire to prolong this. We are going to be on \nthis bill--I understand there are 16 more amendments on that side which \nare serious amendments. We are going to be on this legislation. We made \ngood progress today. I am glad to make some progress. That happens to \nbe the reality on this. Maybe later in the afternoon we could get a \nshort time agreement. But until we work out the side-by-side language \non it, I would not be able to enter into a time agreement at this time \non the Inhofe amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it would be my suggestion, if we can't \nwork out a time agreement on the Inhofe amendment, subject to an \nagreement on all sides, that we try to get the side-by-side before the \nafternoon is up so we can take up the Inhofe amendment first thing \ntomorrow morning, hopefully, on a limited time agreement. Would that be \nacceptable?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. I respectfully say to the chairman that we are ready \nto go with our amendment, and the unanimous consent request propounded \nby the minority leader has a Democratic amendment prior to mine. I \ndon't know. Is that still in the order? I ask if it is. If it is not, I \nask for regular order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, is there a unanimous consent agreement \nsetting up the Inhofe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous agreement has been negated.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Chair repeat that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous agreement has been negated.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The previous unanimous consent has been negated; is that \nmy understanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. How, might I ask, did that happen?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By a subsequent unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto the Cornyn amendment with a time agreement of 2 hours, equally \ndivided. There has been a suggestion by Senator Cornyn that he can take \nless time. Perhaps Senator Kennedy can take less. But the consent \nagreement is for 2 hours, equally divided, with no second degrees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then I ask unanimous consent that we proceed to the \nVitter amendment for 45 minutes, equally divided, with no second-degree \namendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad, when we get to the Vitter amendment, to go \nfor 45 minutes, but I think it is our turn after disposing of the \nCornyn amendment. Senator Lieberman has an amendment, the Lieberman-\nBrownback amendment. We can agree to a short time limit on that. We \nwould want to go back and forth.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Can we have a time agreement on Lieberman-Brownback, 45 \nminutes equally decided?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest an hour. I think we can get it done in 45.\n  Mr. SPECTER. One hour equally divided, no second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Reserving the right to object, may I hear the unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. SPECTER. The unanimous consent request is to go next to the \nLieberman-Brownback amendment for 1 hour, equally divided, with no \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CORNYN. Reserving the right to object, we already have a \nunanimous consent to go to the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We already had the unanimous consent to go to the Cornyn \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that we then lock in the Vitter \namendment next in sequence, for 45 minutes, equally divided.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, the problem is, I say \nrespectfully to our chairman, we are being left out of this queue. If \nwe are going right now to a Democratic amendment, under the regular \norder I should be the next amendment. As it is now, it would be the \nCornyn amendment and then the Democratic amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I modify the request. Senator Vitter is moved. After \nLieberman, we go to the Inhofe amendment, and perhaps by that time we \ncan have them laid down, side by side, and before we begin debate, have \na time agreement.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, we have been trying to get in the \namendment queue for a couple of days. We would love to get locked in, \nalong with this.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We will move to get Senator Ensign in the queue, but we \ncan start on the Cornyn amendment, and we will talk about this in the \ncloakroom.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have no objection. I think for the time \nbeing we have an order now for the next three. I have no objection to \ngoing at sometime to Ensign. I expect that would be the regular order. \nBut for all intents and purposes, we agree to the three outlined here. \nI can understand they will probably follow along, but for all intents \nand purposes, we agree to the three.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Kennedy is correct. May we proceed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nrequests are agreed to.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3965, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I send a modification to amendment 3965 to the desk for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself and Mr. \n     Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 3965, as modified.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3965), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 295, strike lines 14 through 16 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(B) by the alien, if--\n       ``(i) the alien has been employed in H-2C status for a \n     cumulative period of not less than 4 years;\n       ``(ii) an employer attests that the employer will employ \n     the alien in the offered job position; and\n       ``(iii) the Secretary of Labor determines and certifies \n     that there are not sufficient United States workers who are \n     able, willing, qualified, and available to fill the job \n     position.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the bill in the Senate is a massive piece \nof legislation creating a number of new programs within our immigration \nsystem. Obviously, we have talked a lot about border security and ways \nwe can tighten our border to make sure we know who is coming into the \ncountry and why they are here.\n  Second, we also need to make sure we have a successful worksite \nverification program to make sure people who present themselves for \nemployment in the United States are, indeed, legally authorized to work \nin the United States.\n  This is an enormously important comprehensive approach. While I hope \nit is clear that there are some segments of the approach I differ with \nand we are trying to improve, from my perspective, I do support the \napproach of\n\n[[Page S4681]]\n\ncomprehensive immigration reform because we need to deal with the \nsecurity demands of this problem, and we also need to deal with the \neconomic demands of the problem.\n  One of the ways the underlying bill purports to do that is by \ncreating what is called a guest worker program. One component of the \nguest worker program is as follows. For people who are not yet in the \nUnited States but who want to come in the future, this plan creates a \nguest worker program, but what it fails to do is to match up willing \nworkers who want to qualify within this program with an actual job. In \nother words, what it does is creates a phenomenon whereby individuals \nwho participate in the program can literally self-petition without \nhaving an employer sponsor that petition for them to get a green card--\nin other words, to become a legal permanent resident and be put on a \npathway to American citizenship.\n  This amendment strikes that position of the underlying bill which \nwould allow individuals participating in this guest worker program to \nself-petition; that is, without an employer being there to sponsor them \nand acknowledge and attest that no American worker is willing or has \nindicated a willingness to perform that job.\n  This is a fundamental worker protection provision which I hope my \ncolleagues will support. If we don't agree to this amendment, it means \nindividuals can come to the United States as a guest worker and then \nself-petition without having an employer there to sponsor their \napplication for legal permanent residency and can thereby be on a path \nto become an American citizen and end up competing with American \nworkers for those jobs.\n  We all understand America is a compassionate country. We want to make \nsure we do this immigration reform plan correctly. One of the things we \ndo not want to do is actually hurt American workers. Unless we strike \nthe self-petition provision, we will be doing exactly that. We need to \nmake sure before someone can come in and get a job that, No. 1, they \nhave a job and have not just self-petitioned and then become self-\nemployed and perhaps even become a burden on the American taxpayer \nthrough various welfare benefits they might receive. We need to make \nsure before someone gets a job that the employer acknowledges and \nattests that they put it up, they advertised it, and they sought \nAmerican workers to fill that job, but, in fact, no American worker has \ncome forward. Only under those circumstances do I believe a guest \nworker ought to be able to fill that job. This underlying bill does not \nprovide for that.\n  This amendment would say that after 4 years of cumulative employed \nstatus as an H-2C worker, before someone can apply for and receive a \ngreen card, they must do two things: No. 1, they have to find an \nemployer willing to sponsor them; and No. 2, they have to attest that \nno American worker has stepped forward when that job has been offered \nto the public at large; otherwise, we will find this guest worker \nprogram in direct conflict with the needs of native, American-born \nworkers and otherwise legal immigrants. That would be a terrible \ndirection for us to head down.\n  This is one of those provisions of the bill with which, since it is \n600 pages long, many Members may not be intimately familiar. I hope by \nfiling this amendment and by having this debate they can inform \nthemselves and hopefully agree to support this amendment which is \ndesigned to protect American workers and to put the interests of \nAmerican workers first. Then and only then can a participant in this \nguest worker program get the job that an American had an opportunity to \nget but decided not to apply.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield such time as I might use.\n  We will look at exactly who these individuals are who are going to \ncome into the United States and what the process is.\n  First, we will find out that an employer needs a particular kind of \nfunction to be able to continue their business--maybe it is related to \nthe employment of other individuals. They search around to try, for \nsome 60 days, to see if there is an American prepared to take that job \nat that salary. They cannot find an American prepared to take that job, \nand they still need to have that particular function filled. So they \nfind out there is a willing person from overseas prepared to take that \nparticular job, get paid the particular wages mentioned for that \nparticular profile, and that individual then comes to the United States \nand works for that particular employer.\n  Under the current legislation, we are saying that after a period of 4 \nyears--or even before the 4-year-period--if the employer wants to \npetition for a green card for that particular employee, they can go \nahead and do that. That is in the law at the present time.\n  Senator Cornyn's amendment does not do that. We provide after 4 years \nthat if the individual wants to make a petition for that particular \njob, they ought to be entitled to do so. They will still have to wait \nthe 5 years in order to become a citizen. That is a total of 9 years to \nbe able to become a citizen. Senator Cornyn does not want that \nparticular right for that particular worker.\n  One of the things we have seen over the period of years, going back \nto the Bracero issue in question where we had individuals who came into \nthe United States and were extraordinarily exploited--they were \nexploited all the way through by unscrupulous employers because those \nparticular workers did not have any rights in order to be able to \nprotect themselves. In the 1960s, we got rid of the Bracero because it \nwas such a shameful aspect in this country's employment history.\n  We want to avoid the same circumstance with this new legislation. We \nhave tried to learn from 1986, when we had amnesty. We also should have \nhad the prosecution of employers employing individuals who should not \nhave been employed, but that was never enforced.\n  Now we have the earned citizenship. Now we have protections for \nworkers to come in here.\n  Now, we have strengthened border security. We have learned from the \npast. One of the important experiences of learning from the past is not \nto permit these workers to be exploited. One of the best ways to ensure \nthat is to give them--at least after 4 years of working in the United \nStates--the opportunity of getting on the path for a green card and \neventually citizenship.\n  Now, the Senator from Texas does not want that. He wants to leave all \nof the power with the employer. Well, I do not buy that. The employer \nstarts out saying: Look, I need a worker. I can't get a worker. I \nreally need you. You come on in here. I will really look out after you. \nBut I want to tell you something: unless you are going to work those \nextra hours--and I might not pay you overtime--unless you are going to \ndo this or unless you are going to do that, I will never petition for \nyou. And you are not going to be able to petition for yourself.\n  So I think it is an issue about whether we are going to respect \nindividuals and have as much respect for employees as we have for the \nemployers.\n  It is interesting that under this legislation, if an employee comes \nin, and the employer likes that person, they can go ahead and make the \npetition now for the green card. They have the power to do that in the \nfirst year, the second year, the third year, and the fourth year. So we \nare just swinging all of this power into the hands of the employers.\n  If you accept the Cornyn amendment, you are effectively leaving \npeople high and dry on that. I do not think that is what we are trying \nto do.\n  We are trying to have fairness in the legislation. We are trying to \nhave legality, strong border security. We are trying to have an \nemployer-employee relationship where the employer is going to know that \nemployee, has the documents and, therefore, will not go out and hire \nother employees who are here illegally and give them depressed wages, \nwhich will depress the wages on Americans and American workers, which \nis the current case.\n  We are saying we want to stop the exploitation of both those \nindividuals and what is happening to American workers. But we want to \nat least say that after 4 years, where this individual has filled an \nimportant slot that no American worker was prepared to fill, and they \nwant to be a part of the whole American dream, play by the\n\n[[Page S4682]]\n\nrules, pay their taxes, do what any citizen would do in the United \nStates but the employer said: No, I am not going to do it, and then \nthey have to go back to their country, it leaves all the power with the \nemployer and denies the employee respect, which I think will invite \nfurther kinds of exploitation.\n  We do not want to go back to the Bracero period. And this is starting \nus back down that road. I think it is the wrong way to resolve this \nparticular issue. I hope the amendment will not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to make sure our colleagues \nunderstand exactly what this amendment does. It is very short. Let me \nread from it. What it says is one can qualify for a guest worker \nprogram if ``the alien has been employed in H-2C status'' and \nmaintained that ``for a cumulative period of not less than 4 years. . . \n.''\n  Let me make clear, that was part of a negotiation that Senator McCain \nand Senator Graham and others and I entered into before we offered the \nmodification because they felt it would be fairer. I agreed that was a \nreasonable request on their part. I would hope that others would feel \nthe same way.\n  But the second and third parts are the guts of this amendment. It \nalso requires that:\n\n       An employer attests that the employer will employ the alien \n     in the offered job position; and--\n\n  And this is the most important part. This is the American worker \nprotection--\n\n     the Secretary of Labor determines and certifies that there \n     are not sufficient United States workers who are able, \n     willing, qualified, and available to fill the job position.\n\n  Now, this underlying bill provides a lot of protection for guest \nworkers who qualify under this program. And I agree that they should be \nprotected from exploitation. That is one of the reasons this law has \nbeen created. But it does not create exploitation at the hands of an \nemployer any more than any other employee in America is subjected to \nexploitation by their employer. In other words, this does not bind the \nguest worker to a particular employer. Indeed, they can get this \ncertification from any employer who has a job they want to fill subject \nto the requirement that the Secretary of Labor provide this attestation \nthat there are not sufficient U.S. workers ``able, willing, qualified, \nand available to fill the job position.''\n  This amendment does not say these individuals cannot eventually get a \ngreen card if they otherwise qualify, having been sponsored by an \nemployer, and for a job that no American has stepped forward to fill. \nSo it does not tie a worker to a particular employer. It does not limit \nthat. It does not say these guest workers cannot ultimately get a green \ncard.\n  Ultimately, this is not so much about protections for the guest \nworker as it is protections for the American worker. Indeed, one of the \nattributes of sovereignty is that the United States has to regain some \ncontrol not only of our borders but of our broken employment system \nwhich, right now, employs millions of people who cannot legally work in \nthe United States. We are trying to fix that. But it does not fix the \nproblem to say that individuals can continue to come into the United \nStates and compete with American workers.\n  We ought to be all about trying to work out a system that protects \nAmerican workers and yet allows guest workers who qualify to fill the \ngaps that American workers cannot fill. I suggest to my colleagues if \nyou believe the rights of this guest worker are paramount and the \nrights of the American worker are subservient--if you really believe \nthat, then you ought to vote against the amendment. But if you believe \nwe ought to protect the rights of American workers first, and then, in \nthe event the Secretary of Labor certifies there are not sufficient \nAmerican workers, allow guest workers to work--if you think that is a \nbetter system, then you should vote for this amendment.\n  In no sense does this subject any guest worker to exploitation. They \nare protected under this bill by the labor laws that protect all \nAmerican workers. All it does is protect American workers from having \nto compete against guest workers for jobs that would be rightfully \ntheirs and available except for the fact that someone has self-\npetitioned and taken a job that an American would otherwise want and \nwould be able to do.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have difficulty following the logic of \nmy good friend from Texas because American workers are protected when \nthe temporary worker is protected.\n  Now, let me give you a possible factual situation: An employer has \none of these temporary workers. They have gone out and petitioned and \ncan't find an American to do this job. They can't find an American to \ndo the job. Then they have the foreigner who comes in and works for \nthem, and works for them for 4 years.\n  Now, under our proposal, after the 4-year period, if they have paid \ntheir taxes, if they have not gotten into trouble with the law the rest \nof the way, they can petition for a green card. Then, if they follow \nall the procedures, pass the naturalization exam, they can become a \ncitizen 5 years after that--9 years.\n  Now, this is what Mr. Cornyn, the Senator from Texas says: Look, \nafter the 4 years, we are going to take away the right of that person--\nunless the employer is going to petition for them, unless the employer \nis going to do it.\n  Now, you tell me what is going to happen in a lot of the workplaces. \nThe employee says: Look, Mr. Employer, when are you going to petition \nfor me? I have worked for you for 4 years. Under the old bill, they \nused to be able to say I could petition. But they passed the Cornyn \namendment, and it says, no. I am completely dependent upon you.\n  Well, the employer says: Don't ask for a raise. Take a wage cut. Take \na wage cut for a couple of years. Don't complain about unfair working \nconditions. Don't complain about it. Don't complain about working a \nlittle longer, working Saturdays, maybe a few hours on Sunday. If you \ncomplain about it, I am not going to petition for you. You are going to \nbe left high and dry.\n  You tell me how that protects American workers. Once you get the \nexploitation of the temporary worker, we see what happens, as we have \nseen today: Employers are employing the undocumented and they are \npaying them a good deal less. That is an adverse impact and effect on \nAmerican wages. If you raise those wages and give them the protections \nwe have under our legislation, that is going to protect American \nworkers.\n  I fail to understand--when you give the whole deck of cards to the \nemployer, and tell the employer he can do anything he wants with that \nemployee--how that employee is protected and how an American worker is \nprotected. I just do not get it. I just do not see it. It defies \nhistory. It defies the history of the old employment. It can work very \nwell for that particular employer because he has that employee right by \nthe throat because if that employee complains, does not do what the \nemployer says, that person is on their way back to whatever country \nthey came from, or they will disappear into the community. That is not \ngood. That is what we are trying to avoid--exploitation.\n  I think this is what we have tried to do throughout the bill both in \nterms of the exploitation of workers, in terms of the legal system, the \nlegal structure, and in terms of the border security, and the others. I \nhave difficulty in following the rationale and the reasoning that if \nyou give one person in the employer-employee relationship all of the \ncards, that somehow inures to the benefit of the employee. It never has \nin the history of the relationship between workers and employers, and \nit will not. And it will not if that is the outcome of the Cornyn \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Sure. Yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts whether there is a requirement that an employer sponsor a \nguest worker when they first enter the country under the H-2C program?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The answer to that is affirmative, yes.\n\n[[Page S4683]]\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I would ask, if I may, Mr. President, if the Senator will \nyield for one more question, whether it is true that, for example, \nhigh-skilled workers, H-1B workers--people with math, science, \nengineering degrees, and the like--whether there is a requirement that \nthere be an employer who actually sponsors those workers before they \ncan receive one of those types of visas?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The answer is affirmative, yes.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a very fundamental reason why. You \nare talking about the H-1B. You are talking about the most highly \nskilled, highly educated, and highly competent individuals in the \nworld--H-1B--going on to universities, going into the high-tech areas, \nindividuals for which the world is their oyster. They do not suffer the \nkind of exploitation, the kind of humiliation that other workers \nsuffer. These workers are taking jobs that American workers will not \ntake.\n  There is a big difference between that and going to the top companies \nof America and working for the CEO, when you have all the education, \nthe professional degrees. Those individuals are not the ones being \nexploited. They never have been, and they are not today. It is an \nentirely different situation.\n  We are talking about the tough, difficult work that no American will \ntake. We are talking about the history of these kinds of jobs. We have \nseen it. We have read about it. We have experienced it. I did, \ncertainly, in the early 1960s, going across the Southwest in the \nBracero Program. Exploitation is one of the sad aspects of American \nemployment history. We do not want to go there.\n  The H-2Bs in my State are doing very well at universities and \ncolleges and enormously successful businesses. The idea behind the H-\n2Bs was getting the very able and gifted people. As history has shown, \nthat results in the hiring of additional people because of their \nabilities. They end up, as a result of these programs, adding key \nelements of success to various businesses and employment expands. \nGenerally, those are good jobs with good benefits and good retirement. \nThat is an entirely different situation. I am glad we were able to \nclear that up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from \nMassachusetts candidly responding to the questions I asked. What his \nanswers established was that in order for guest workers under his \nproposal to come into the country in the first place, they have to have \nan employer, someone who has indicated that there is a job available \nfor them. Under the amendment, they could work in that job for a \ncumulative period of up to 4 years. But for some reason, under the \ncurrent bill, after 4 years, you would no longer have to have an \nemployer who would certify that they had a job available for that guest \nworker to do and that no American was available to do it.\n  I also appreciate the Senator's candor in answering the question \nabout highly skilled workers. As his answer indicated, highly skilled \nworkers cannot come into the country unless there is an employer who is \nwilling to sponsor them. My point is that we ought to make our \nimmigration law uniform across the employment spectrum, whether you are \na high-skilled worker or whether you are a low-skilled worker.\n  The Senator mentioned the Bracero Program and reports of exploitation \nof workers in America's past. I won't debate that with him. I have read \nof reports of problems with the Bracero Program. While the program as a \nwhole was pretty good, I won't debate whether there were some problems \nassociated with it. But America, in 2006, is not America in the 1950s. \nThe legal protection that is available for guest workers under this \nprogram, the vigilance of the media and advocacy groups, will make it \nvirtually impossible for the kind of exploitation the Senator talks \nabout to occur. What happens is, in spite of the protections offered to \nthe guest workers under our labor laws and despite the vigilance of the \nmedia and advocacy groups that would likely disclose any problems with \na relationship between a guest worker and that employer, what we are \nfinding out is that the one who ultimately has to pay the price for \nthis concern, that I believe will not be realized and is not real, is \nthe American worker who can't find a job because we have offered that \njob to a guest worker who has come into the United States.\n  At bottom, we ought to be as sure as we possibly can that whatever we \ndo doesn't create more problems for American workers. The answer is, \nlet's give American workers every opportunity to find jobs and then, if \nwe can't find a sufficient workforce, let's give guest workers an \nopportunity to fill in those gaps. That is a worthy objective. But we \nshould not be blind to the potential dangers to American workers losing \njobs to guest workers under this program, unless the protections in \nthis amendment are adopted--that an employer attest that the employer \nwill employ the alien in the offered job position and the Secretary of \nLabor determines and certifies that there are not sufficient U.S. \nworkers who are able, willing, qualified, and available to fill the job \nposition.\n  I don't know whether there are others who want to speak either for or \nagainst the amendment. I know we agreed to an hour between us. \nDepending on whether the distinguished manager of the bill on the \nminority side would be interested in yielding time back, I think we \nhave had a chance to cover the merits of this particular amendment. I \nam prepared to yield the remainder of our time back, if he is likewise \nprepared to yield the remainder of his time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Texas, before \nhe went to a necessary meeting at the White House, indicated he was \nprepared to yield back his time if I yielded back my time. I am \nprepared to yield back my time.\n  Mr. President, I withhold my request. I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Nebraska, if I have it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hagel are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the time has been yielded back by Senator \nCornyn and Senator Kennedy on the Cornyn amendment. We are now ready to \nproceed with the Lieberman-Brownback amendment. If they will come to \nthe floor, we can move ahead.\n  In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, Mr. President, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we had expected the Cornyn amendment to \ntake 2 hours, which was the time agreement. Time was yielded back. \nSenator Vitter has now come to the floor. We are unable to proceed with \nthe amendment in regular form, but I do think it would be appropriate \nto have Senator Vitter discuss his amendment, which could abbreviate \nthe time which we would need when he lays it down. So, if I may, I \nwould like to yield the floor to the Senator from Louisiana for \npurposes of having him discuss his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3964\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee for creating this opportunity to begin to discuss this \namendment.\n  This is amendment No. 3964. This amendment would close some very \nserious invitations for fraud that are contained in the bill as it now \nstands.\n\n[[Page S4684]]\n\n  I said on the floor before that I have some very serious reservations \nwith this bill. One of those is that it is riddled with loopholes and \ninvitations for fraud. There are many of these, in my opinion. As I \nhave said many times over, the devil is in the details. Senators need \nto read this bill. Senators need to look at the details and understand \nhow it would work, or more accurately how it would not work in \npractice, because this is not just an esoteric debate on the Senate \nfloor. This would be law which would be put into practice, and we need \nto think about the hard nuts-and-bolts issues of how this would work or \nhow it would not work in practice.\n  Unfortunately, I believe these loopholes, these invitations to fraud, \nand these other detail problems are numerous in the bill. My amendment, \nNo. 3964, simply highlights and hopefully will correct, if adopted, a \ncouple of these specific provisions. These are among the most important \ninvitations for fraud and problems. In particular, there are glaring \nloopholes contained in section 601 of the bill.\n  We have heard over and over how this bill does not contain amnesty. \nIt is not amnesty, the proponents say. And one of the reasons they say \nthat illegal aliens are put into different categories is according to \nhow many years they have been in the country. They are treated \ndifferently according to how many years they have been in the country. \nPresident Bush made this point on Monday night specifically, that folks \nshould be treated differently if they have been in the country for many \nyears, if they have put down roots, if they have family here, et \ncetera, versus if they have just come into the country and have been \nhere a clearly shorter period of time. That is a reasonable argument.\n  The problem is, when you look at the details of the bill, when you \nactually read the bill, again the devil is in the details. The details \nof this bill make a mockery of that distinction. Why do I say that? It \nis because under the provisions of the bill that say how an illegal \nalien may prove how long he has been in the country, there are many \ndifferent types of proof which are acceptable--certain documents, \ncertain sworn affidavits from employers, certain records. But another \nform of acceptable proof is nothing more than a statement by that \nillegal alien himself, signed by that person, a piece of paper saying: \nI have been in the country some years, under these circumstances; here \nis my signature.\n  Again, for this to be an acceptable method of proof to put an illegal \nalien in the best category that offers the best track to citizenship, a \nprogram I would absolutely characterize as amnesty, obviously means \nthat these distinctions, depending on how long you have been in the \ncountry, are meaningless. In practice, all a person has to do to put \nhimself in the best category, the most lucrative category that will \nlead to this amnesty, is to sign a piece of paper saying it is so. That \nis an enormous invitation to fraud. That is a huge loophole which will \nmake all of the related provisions of this bill completely unworkable.\n  There are other aspects of the bill that are similar. There are other \ndistinctions between having been in the country 2 years, less than 2 \nyears versus between 2 and 5 years. Again, the devil is in the details. \nWhen one looks at the proof required for these various categories, \nagain a simple affidavit signed by any third party is acceptable in \nthat case. Again, that makes the whole system unenforceable. That makes \nall of these distinctions meaningless and, in fact, ridiculous.\n  We need to close these loopholes. We need to require more significant \nproof and documentary evidence than a simple affidavit signed either by \nthe illegal alien himself or any third person. That is what my \namendment would correct. If a Senator wants to be half serious about \nmaking this work, if a Senator wants to put any meaning behind his or \nher words in favor of enforcement, clearly we need to fix these glaring \ndeficiencies in the bill.\n  In summary, my amendment would close just some of the loopholes in \nsection 602 of the underlying bill. These loopholes would not only \nallow fraud but create incentives for illegal aliens to commit fraud.\n  My amendment would strike the language allowing an alien to prove \nemployment history by providing a self-signed sworn declaration--\nnothing more than a piece of paper with the illegal alien's own \nsignature.\n  My amendment would require that sworn affidavits from nonrelatives \nwho have direct knowledge of the alien's work be corroborated by the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security and include contact \ninformation of the affiant, the nature and duration of the \nrelationship, his name and address, and the phone number of the \naffiant's relationship. In other words, these types of affidavits can \nat least be checked. At least the Secretary of the Department of \nHomeland Security and his personnel can put some rigor into the process \nto see if these statements by third persons are true.\n  My amendment would make the types of other documents provided to \nprove work history the same for those illegal aliens who have been \nliving in the United States for over 5 years and those who have been \nhere between 2 and 5 years, bringing some more rigor, some more demand \nfor objective evidence into the enforcement mechanism.\n  My amendment would clarify that the alien has the burden of proving \nhis or her employment history by a preponderance of the evidence.\n  Again, I am very fearful that the Senate is doing on this matter what \nwe do all too often. We have these debates. We get very involved in \nwords and arguments. Yet we ignore where the rubber really hits the \nroad--the details, the practicality of enforcement: is this system \nreally going to work? Are these promises really going to be borne out \nto the American people? The devil is in the details. We need to have a \nsystem that is workable.\n  We have lived this history before. The 1986 experience was an utter \nfailure because the enforcement mechanism was completely unworkable. \nAre we going to repeat that history or are we going to have enforcement \nthat is workable, that is meaningful?\n  If we are going to make these distinctions, they have to be able to \nbe meaningful in practice. If an illegal alien can put himself in the \nbest category on that path to amnesty versus the category in which he \ntruly belongs based on the number of years he has truly been in the \ncountry, then all of these promises by the proponents of the bill are \nutterly meaningless and the enforcement mechanism will be utterly \nunworkable. We need to fix these sorts of glaring loopholes and \ninvitations to fraud in the bill.\n  Let me not oversell my amendment. My amendment does not fix all of \nthose loopholes, it does not close down all of those outright \ninvitations to fraud, but it does address two of the most important, \ntwo of the most serious. I invite all Senators on both sides of this \ndebate to come together to pass this amendment.\n  Again, I think this is one of these gut-check amendments. This is one \nof the basic threshold test amendments, like the security fence \namendment was. If a Senator isn't willing to close this sort out of \noutrageous loophole, then that Senator, in my opinion, is not serious \nin the least about making enforcement work. This is an absolute minimum \nto begin closing these serious loopholes.\n  I look forward to coming back to this amendment tomorrow when I will \nbe able to present it formally on the floor and have the entire Senate \ntake it up. I look forward to Senators from both sides of the aisle--in \nfact, both sides of this debate--coming together in support of my \namendment because it is a basic gut-check amendment. It is an absolute \nminimum that needs to be done to begin to close these outrageous \nloopholes and invitations to fraud in the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I oppose the Cornyn amendment because I \nbelieve it undermines the careful balance between American workers and \nbusiness that is contained in the bill.\n  The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act, S. 2611, allows guest \nworkers under the new H-2C visa to work initially on a temporary visa \nand to apply later for a green card if their work is needed over a long \nperiod of time. Under the program, after 1-year the employer of the \nimmigrant guest worker could petition for a green card. Alternatively, \nafter 4-years the immigrant guest worker could petition on his or her \nown for permanent resident status.\n\n[[Page S4685]]\n\n  The Cornyn amendment would strike the right of immigrant guest \nworkers to self-petition. This is a dangerous proposal. One of the \nreasons that guest worker programs have failed in the past is that \nprior programs did not provide labor rights to the temporary workers. \nBy placing the rights of petition exclusively in the hands of \nemployers, unscrupulous actors have the ability to manipulate or abuse \nworkers by controlling the workers' access to legal immigration status.\n  The bill before us is a compromise package that seeks to balance the \nrights of American business and labor, and that enhances our economy \nand national security by bringing illegal workers out the shadows. The \nbalance depends in part on treating all workers equally, including \ngiving immigrant workers the same labor rights that are available to \nU.S. citizens. If all workers possess the same rights, then employers \ncannot depress wages by preying on illegal workers, or workers whose \nstatus is held hostage by their employers. The business community \nunderstands this issue and therefore the Essential Worker Coalition, a \nbroad coalition of employers and associations calling for comprehensive \nimmigration reform, is opposed to the Cornyn amendment.\n  Under the bill, immigrants who decide to self-petition will have to \nmeet all of the other requirements for a green card. In the new guest \nworker program, these requirements include a work requirement, passing \nsecurity and background checks, demonstrating that the immigrant is \nlearning English and civics, and undergoing medical exams.\n  The self-petition provision in the bill is not a backdoor or a short \ncut to citizenship. It should not be stricken by the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask consent that the vote in relation \nto the Cornyn amendment occur at 6 o'clock this evening; provided \nfurther that the amendment be temporarily set aside to allow Senator \nInhofe to offer an amendment; and finally, I ask consent that Senator \nCornyn be recognized for up to 2 minutes on his amendment prior to the \nvote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I am not the manager of \nthis bill, but I have been called into service because the manager on \nour side is not immediately available. I apologize for that.\n  Senator Kennedy's staff informs me apparently Senator Lieberman will \nnot go forward with his amendment and Senator Kennedy would like to \nhave an amendment on our side before we go back to the other side. \nPerhaps that can be worked out with the managers.\n  At this point, I am constrained to object to setting the amendment \naside.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In light of that objection, perhaps we can start with \nsome discussion by Senator Inhofe in the absence of setting aside the \namendment and having him lay down the amendment so we do not waste more \ntime.\n  I ask consent the vote be set at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If I could ask the acting majority leader a question, it \nis my understanding the Lieberman amendment that was to be the \nDemocratic amendment between the two Republicans amendments is now not \ngoing to be offered, at least at this time; that being the case, would \nthe Senator object to setting the current amendment aside for me to \nbring mine up for consideration? Is this what the Senator is objecting \nto?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes, the Senator is correct. I apologize to the Senator. \nI'm not the manager of this bill. I am simply standing in for the \nmanager of the bill on our side who is not available at this moment. \nThat is what I have been asked to do on behalf of the manager.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Kennedy amendment you are talking about putting up \nnow, would that be considered next after this vote takes place on the \nCornyn amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Is there any time that has been scheduled for his \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Not that I know of.\n  I apologize to the Senator. We are in this bit of a situation where \nwe have to have a manager of our bill here before those agreements can \nbe made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is currently \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in an effort to not lose any more time, \nwe had an amendment by Senator Lieberman, which he decided not to \noffer. It is more time to discuss the rules as to whether that \nconstitutes the Democratic amendment, but the suggestion has been made \nthat the Democrats are be agreeable to setting aside the Cornyn \namendment on the condition that a Democratic amendment will be \nconsidered before Senator Inhofe's amendment is considered further, but \nSenator Inhofe would be permitted to lay down his amendment and speak \nfor a few minutes. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. CONRAD. With that understanding, that is entirely acceptable on \nthis side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to ask one more question. \nAfter the Cornyn amendment, we will go to the Kennedy amendment. I am \nlocked in after that; is that our understanding?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is the understanding of this Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. And this Senator.\n  It is our understanding, then, after we dispose of the Kennedy \namendment, then we come to my amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4064\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the current \namendment and bring up amendment No. 4064.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for himself, Mr. \n     Byrd, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Coburn, Mr. \n     Burns, and Mr. Bunning, proposes an amendment numbered 4064.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To amend title 4 United States Code, to declare English as \nthe national language of the United States and to promote the patriotic \n                integration of prospective US citizens)\n\n       On page 295, line 22, strike ``the alien--'' and all that \n     follows through page 296, line 5, and insert ``the alien \n     meets the requirements of section 312.''.\n       On page 352, line 3, strike ``either--'' and all that \n     follows through line 15, and insert ``meets the requirements \n     of section 312(a) (relating to English proficiency and \n     understanding of United States history and Government).''.\n       On page 614, after line 5, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 766.

The Department of Homeland Security is currently \n     conducting a review of the testing process used to ensure \n     prospective United States citizens demonstrate said knowledge \n     of the English language and United States history and \n     government for the purpose of redesigning said test.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this section only, the \n     following words are defined:\n       (1) Key documents.--The term ``key documents'' means the \n     documents that established or explained the foundational \n     principles of democracy in the United States, including the \n     United States Constitution and the amendments to the \n     Constitution (particularly the Bill of Rights), the \n     Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, and the \n     Emancipation Proclamation.\n       (2) Key events.--The term ``key events'' means the critical \n     turning points in the history of the United States (including \n     the American Revolution, the Civil War, the world wars of the \n     twentieth century, the civil rights movement, and the major \n     court decisions and legislation) that contributed to \n     extending the promise of democracy in American life.\n       (3) Key ideas.--The term ``key ideas'' means the ideas that \n     shaped the democratic institutions and heritage of the United \n     States, including the notion of equal justice under the law, \n     freedom, individualism, human rights, and a belief in \n     progress.\n       (4) Key persons.--The term ``key persons'' means the men \n     and women who led the United States as founding fathers, \n     elected officials, scientists, inventors, pioneers, advocates \n     of equal rights, entrepreneurs, and artists.\n       (c) Goals for Citizenship Test Redesign.--The Department of \n     Homeland Security shall establish as goals of the testing \n     process designed to comply with provisions of [8 U.S.C. \n     1423(a)] that prospective citizens:\n       a.

I know we will have a vote at 6 o'clock, so I will \nparaphrase a few things so everyone will know in advance what we are \ndoing.\n  This is English as the national language amendment. We talked about \nit at length last night. It has been very popular and enjoyed the \nsupport of most of the Members in the Senate today.\n  We heard the other night when the President made his speech, among \nother things:\n\n       . . . an ability to speak and write the English language is \n     very significant . . . English allows newcomers to go from \n     picking crops to opening a grocery . . . from cleaning \n     offices to running offices . . . from a life of low-paying \n     jobs to a diploma, a career, and a home of their own.\n\n  He also said:\n\n       Every new citizen of the United States has an obligation to \n     our customs and values, including liberty and civic \n     responsibility, equality under God and tolerance for others \n     and the English language.\n\n  I recall President Clinton standing on the floor and making the \nstatement about the responsibility of new people coming into this \ncountry. He said:\n\n       . . . they have the responsibility to enter the mainstream \n     of American life. That means learning English and learning \n     about our democratic system of government.\n\n  Many others have been quoted, going all the way back to Teddy \nRoosevelt, that we must also learn one language. That language is \nEnglish.\n  This has been aired quite a number of times. In 1997, Senator Shelby \noffered the amendment and never got a vote on the amendment, but he did \nhave a number of Democrats and Republicans as cosponsors of the \namendment. We currently have Senators Byrd, Bunning, Burns, Chambliss, \nCoburn, Enzi, and Sessions as cosponsors of this amendment, and we have \nnot made an effort to get more cosponsors which we will do prior to \nbringing it up after the Kennedy amendment.\n  The time has come to go ahead and do it and quit talking about it. \nThis time is now.\n  There has been a lot of polling data that shows that the vast \nmajority of Americans, the most recent one being the Zogby poll only a \ncouple of months ago, 84 percent of Americans want this as the \nlanguage. Interestingly enough, when they segregate out the Latinos who \nresponded to the polling, over 70 percent in many polls--which I will \ngo over when there is more time--support this as our national language.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question, briefly?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Of course.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could the Senator share with this Senator and colleagues, \nwhat is the upshot of the Senator's amendment? What is the force and \neffect that would be provided in law if the Senator's amendment were \nagreed to?\n  Mr. INHOFE. We would be joining 51 other countries that have English \nas their language; 27 States have used this language in the State \nlegislature to make this their language.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would it be that English would be the official language \nof the country?\n  Mr. INHOFE. The national language, yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Are there legal requirements as to how that would apply?\n  Mr. INHOFE. There are, yes. There are some.\n  First of all, there are some exceptions. Our language says ``except \nwhere otherwise provided in law.'' There are some exceptions. For \nexample, before the Court Interpreters Act, passed in 1978, defendants \ndid not have the right to an interpreter. It was up to the court's own \ndiscretion. In 1978, they said that they did. This has not changed \nthat. This leaves that in place. We also have the bilingual ballots \nrequirement, Voting Rights Act. That is not changed by this. Maybe it \nshould be changed, but that should take special legislation that \naddresses the Voting Rights Act.\n  The national disaster emergency evacuation provides if you had \nsomething in California, for example, where there was a tsunami, you \ncould use the Chinese language in Chinatown, in places where it is \nappropriate. It leaves those common sense things in place.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Could I say to the Senator, speaking for myself, I am \nvery interested in his legislation. If he could provide a copy of that \nlegislation and an interpretation to my office, I might well be a \ncosponsor of the Senator's legislation.\n  My family came here as immigrants from Scandinavia. The first thing \nthey wanted to do was to learn English. My wife's family came here as \nimmigrants from Italy. The first thing they wanted to do was learn \nEnglish. I don't think we do people any favors by not having a \nrequirement in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time of 6 \no'clock has arrived, and the Cornyn amendment is the matter before the \nSenate. It will be brought to a vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, again, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I also would like to \nsay, our family came from Germany, and that is the first thing they \ndid, too.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3965, as Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to tell my colleagues that we had \nsome\n\n[[Page S4687]]\n\ngood-faith negotiations with Senator Cornyn. I am sorry I was unable to \ntalk to him before this vote. I know he had a previous engagement down \nat the White House. But the Kennedy amendment will probably be a side-\nby-side since there are still areas of the Cornyn amendment we have \ndifficulty agreeing to.\n  So I wish I could have talked with Senator Cornyn since I think our \ndifferences are minimal, but we still have not resolved them.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Kohl) and \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 128 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Kohl\n     Rockefeller\n       \n  The amendment (No. 3965), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CORNYN.

The \nfifth will be offered by Senator Nelson. The sixth will be offered by \nSenator Vitter. The seventh will be offered by Senator Durbin. The \neighth will be offered by Senator Kyl. And then our next amendment, \nafter a Democratic amendment, will be by Senator Chambliss.\n  What we would like to do is have the Senators present promptly, and \nwe would appreciate it if we get people down here about a half hour \nbefore their amendment comes up. We had some dead time today because we \nhad nobody on deck. But we want to give people notice so we can proceed \nexpeditiously. We have a great many amendments, and we want to move on \nthem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time agreement on Senator Kennedy's \namendment be 10 minutes equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So we will have an early vote tomorrow morning to get us \nstarted.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

KIRBY GODSEY\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man \nwho has earned a place in Georgia history and, in my opinion, will be \nunmatched for many years to come. My good friend, Dr. Kirby Godsey, has \nserved as the president of Mercer University since 1979. He is \ncurrently the longest serving university president, not only in Mercer \nhistory, but in Georgia history as well. He has presided over 250 \ngraduation ceremonies. He will retire on the 30th day of June of this \nyear.\n  Kirby Godsey has achieved so much, I simply don't know where to \nbegin. He is the embodiment of a great educator, a dedicated community \nleader, public servant, spiritual advisor, problem solver, and the list \ngoes on. His accomplishments are endless.\n  My wife Julianne and I have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Godsey \nfor many years. In fact, my son Bo received his undergraduate and law \ndegrees from Mercer University and Mercer Law School not too long ago. \nDuring my years in the Congress, I have always appreciated his \nexpertise and knowledge on the issues that he has discussed with me \nduring his visits to Washington, as well as in Macon, on many complex \nmatters relevant to education and otherwise.\n  Dr. Godsey has been named three times among the top 100 most \ninfluential Georgians by Georgia Trend magazine for his commitment to \nquality education, to economic growth, and to the needs of Georgians. \nHe has received this honor multiple times for good reason, his impact \non the State is extensive.\n  During his presidency, Mercer University has become one of the \nleading and most comprehensive universities of its size in the Nation, \nwith 10 schools and colleges. When Dr. Godsey became president of \nMercer in 1979, the enrollment was 3,800, the budget was $21.3 million, \nand the endowment was $16.5 million. Back then, the university's \neconomic impact on Georgia was more than $21 million. Today, Mercer's \nenrollment is more than 7,300; the budget is $175 million, and the \nendowment is close to $200 million, with more than $200 million \nexpected to be received in the near future from planned gifts.\n  But if you ask Kirby Godsey about the legacy that he will leave \nbehind with his upcoming retirement, he won't point to any of those \nthings. To him, it is not about bricks and mortar and money. To Kirby, \nit is about the students, the graduates of Mercer University who are \nmaking the school a proud institution through their professions and \nservice to others--and their contributions to the greater good.\n  To Kirby Godsey, service learning is a key priority. Mercer's \nreputation for scholastic excellence, rigorous academic programs, \ninnovative teaching, and time-honored values has earned its designation \nin 2005 as a ``College with a Conscience'' by the Princeton Review and \nCampus Compact. For 16 consecutive years, Mercer has been recognized as \none of the leading universities in the South by U.S. News & World \nReport.\n  Dr. Kirby Godsey is a workhorse, and I will share a few examples. \nWhen Middle Georgia leaders asked him to establish a medical school, he \ntraveled throughout the State, talking with community and State leaders \nand developing vital partnerships. Accepting only Georgia residents in \nits doctor of medicine program, Mercer School of Medicine opened in \n1982 with a mission to educate more physicians to serve Georgians.\n  Today, Mercer graduates practice in 112 towns and cities and 87 \ncounties in Georgia and handle more than 1.3 million patient visits \neach year. Instead of developing a separate teaching hospital, Dr. \nGodsey developed strong partnerships with the Medical Center of Central \nGeorgia in Macon and Memorial Health University Medical Center in \nSavannah. Those partnerships have enabled Macon and Savannah to become \nmajor hubs of health care services in Georgia.\n\n[[Page S4688]]\n\n  He has established a Center for Health & Learning in partnership with \nPiedmont Healthcare in Atlanta. And with the increasing shortages of \npharmacists, nurses, and educators nationwide, Dr. Godsey has worked to \nensure that Mercer addresses these critical needs through undergraduate \nand graduate programs.\n  In the early 1980s, Middle Georgia's economic engine, Robins Air \nForce Base, struggled to find enough engineers, endangering its \ncontinuing operations. So the base commander turned to Dr. Godsey for a \nsolution. In 1985, Mercer opened the school of engineering on the Macon \ncampus and the Mercer Engineering Research Center in Warner Robins. \nMore than 62 percent of Mercer engineering graduates work in Georgia, \nand the university is the No. 1 provider of engineers to Robins Air \nForce Base. The Mercer Engineering Research Center that the university \nestablished in Warner Robins has exceeded more than $189 million in \ncontract revenue in research.\n  Dr. Godsey happened to be in my office today, and he advised me that \nhe has now secured the full funding for a new engineering building to \nbe located on the Mercer campus in Macon. It is a building we have \nhelped contribute to at the Federal level. He has also gotten State \nfunding. But the overwhelming amount of money needed to construct this \nfacility was contributed by private individuals around our State and \naround the country.\n  It has been a privilege to work with Dr. Godsey over the years, and \nwe have worked to secure funding for a program that is vital to Warner \nRobins Air Logistics Center, the Critical Personnel Development \nProgram. The centerpiece of this educational partnership between Robins \nand Mercer's Macon campus is to provide a state-of-the-art facility for \nacademic training and laboratory research in support of the Logistics \nCenter's mission requirements. In addition, it will create regional \neconomic development opportunities, and we all know how critical that \nis. I am pleased, as I said, that Mercer University has now secured \nthis vital funding and is finalizing this project. As this project \nbecomes a true reality, we will all be able to recall Dr. Godsey's hard \nwork on this effort.\n\n  There is no question, Kirby Godsey has been a strong advocate for his \ncommunity. Under his leadership, the Mercer Center for Community \nDevelopment, which promotes stronger community ties by working to \nsocially and economically revitalize neighborhoods around the school, \nreceived the Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter Campus-Community Partnership \nAward in 2002.\n  He has served as chairman of New Town Macon since its beginning in \n1996 and has worked hard to revitalize the downtown area in Macon, \nGeorgia. Incidentally, my Middle Georgia Senate office is located \nthere, and I can say without question, the revitalization efforts have \nbeen incredible. In 2003, Dr. Godsey was named the Citizen of the Year \nby the Greater Macon Chamber of Commerce and presented him with its \nhighest honor, the prestigious Meritorious Service Award.\n  He has also been recognized for influencing the quality of education \nacross the Southeast as a leader with the Southern Association of \nColleges and Schools. In 2002, the Council for the Advancement and \nSupport of Education recognized him as the Southeast's CEO of the year. \nIt is also fitting that in 2006, the Georgia Legislature honored him at \nthe State capitol for his many accomplishments during his 27-year \npresidency.\n  Kirby Godsey is an inspirational leader whose dedication to Mercer \nUniversity has enabled great advancements in our community, our State, \nand our Nation. He is a good friend and a true hero to the State of \nGeorgia. I ask the Members of the Senate to join me in paying tribute \nto this great Georgian, this great American, and a great friend of this \nMember of the Senate--Kirby Godsey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4688-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO FORMER CONGRESSMAN SONNY MONTGOMERY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to a \nformer friend and colleague, one who contributed mightily to this great \nNation over many years. Yesterday, in Meridian, MS, the former chairman \nof the House Veterans' Committee, Congressman Sonny Montgomery, was \nlaid to rest. Two of our colleagues in this body, Senators Cochran and \nLott, were in attendance and spoke at Chairman Montgomery's funeral. \nSenators Cochran and Lott were very close to Congressman Montgomery. \nThey were Members in the House together for many years.\n  I had the privilege of knowing Sonny Montgomery for over 35 years. He \nwas one of those unique public servants whom all who knew him, liked \nhim, respected him.\n  He contributed to this country every day. He was a Democrat from \nMississippi. He was proud of that fact. He never ran from it. He knew \nwho he was, and he believed in things. But he always brought a sense of \npurpose, he brought a sense of importance, he brought a sense of \nbipartisanship, dignity, tolerance, and respect to the body and the \ninstitution he served.\n  At a time in American politics when we are lacking those graces, we \nlook to people such as Sonny Montgomery and recall the impact he had on \nthe Congress of the United States, how he brought people together. He \nformed a consensus of purpose. There were differences--there should be \ndifferences--but he was anchored with the belief first in his country, \nsecond in his responsibilities as a Member of Congress, and third in \nhis party. He always represented his district, his State, and his \ncountry with great dignity.\n  Sonny Montgomery was a World War II veteran and a Korean war veteran. \nHe became an Army National Guard general and served as chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Veterans' Affairs for 13 years.\n  There are many personal stories about Sonny Montgomery. One that is \nlegend in Washington is his close, almost brotherly, relationship with \nthe first President Bush. The first President Bush was elected to \nCongress on the same day Sonny Montgomery was elected--a Republican \nfrom Texas, a Democrat from Mississippi--in 1966. They became very \nclose friends. As a matter of fact, Barbara Bush spoke yesterday at \nSonny Montgomery's funeral.\n  That is but one example of the affection and respect that all who \nknew Sonny Montgomery had for him. Here is a man who led legislation \nthat increased veterans eligibility for home loans, veterans life \ninsurance, increased medical coverage for veterans, and he was the \nsponsor of a law that made the Veterans' Administration the 14th \nCabinet department of our Government in 1988.\n  I had the privilege of serving with President Reagan as President \nReagan's first Deputy Administrator of the Veterans' Administration, so \nI worked closely with Sonny Montgomery.\n  On a personal note, I met my wife Lilibet in 1982 when she was \nworking for Sonny Montgomery. Lilibet is from Meridian, MS. That is \nwhere Sonny Montgomery was born 86 years ago. That is how Lilibet got a \njob on Capitol Hill, and that is how I met her.\n  It is those kinds of personal stories that are by the hundreds, \npeople who somehow Sonny Montgomery was close to and had some \nresponsibility for connecting. His reach was long, and it is \nappropriate that not only we recognize him but remember him and thank \nhim, but again, as I said earlier, at a time when our country is \ndivided in a very dangerous way--and that is reflected to a great \nextent in the Congress of the United States--there are those to whom we \ncan reach back to inspire us to greater heights, to expect more from \nourselves, and do more for our country, if we would take the Sonny \nMontgomery model of service to his country and service to those he had \nthe privilege of leading.\n  I appreciate very much the opportunity to make these remarks about a \ndear friend, one we will all miss, especially those who had the \nopportunity to serve with him in some capacity over his glorious 30 \nyears in the Congress of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4688-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4688-S4689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CELEBRATING THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF TOYOTA MOTOR MANUFACTURING, \n                                INDIANA\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

A study by the University of \nEvansville concluded that TMMI's production in Princeton has created \n8,865 jobs in Gibson County, 12,990 in the Evansville metropolitan \narea, and 31,385 across the State of Indiana. TMMI's investment has \nresulted in more than $5.5 billion in business sales. This economic \nactivity has strengthened communities and improved lives across the \nState.\n  I am also pleased that TMMI's dedication to the State of Indiana will \nbe growing in the coming years. In March, I had the privilege of \nsharing with my fellow Hoosiers news that Toyota will begin production \nof the Camry in Lafayette. It is expected that this venture will create \nan additional 1,000 jobs in Indiana. This decision signals a \nrecognition by Toyota that the highly skilled Hoosier workforce and \nattractive business climate in Indiana will allow them to achieve their \ngoals in the coming years.\n  I am hopeful that you will join me in congratulating Toyota Motor \nManufacturing, Indiana, and in wishing them many years of success and \nleadership in Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4689-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TOYOTA MOTOR COMPANY\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to extend my heartfelt \ncongratulations to the Toyota Motor Company for their 20 years of \nsuccessful and prosperous operations in Georgetown, KY. This stunning \nachievement serves as a shining example to us all in regards to \nleadership and innovation in the American workforce.\n  Since coming to Kentucky in 1986, Toyota has provided our State with \nthousands of job opportunities while giving the employees the ability \nto contribute ideas for product improvement, oversee quality control, \nand continually strive for perfection. This strive has resulted in the \nToyota Camry being named the most popular car on the American \nautomotive market eight times out of the last 9 years.\n  With three locations in Kentucky, the Georgetown manufacturing plant, \nthe North American Parts Center--Kentucky, and the company's largest \nNorth American manufacturing headquarters in Erlanger, KY, it is easy \nto see the economic benefits that Toyota has brought to our State. The \nGeorgetown plant alone employs over 7,000 team members and has \ngenerated over 34,000 jobs in Kentucky and nearly 100,000 jobs across \nthe United States. So often we hear about jobs being lost to overseas \nfirms, but in Kentucky we are fortunate the Toyota jobs came to us. \nThis partnership has benefited Toyota and Kentucky, and I know both \nparties will reap the benefits for years to come.\n  Today, the Georgetown production facility is Toyota's largest \nproduction plant in North America. Kentucky's dedicated skilled \nproduction team has been key to Toyota's success.\n  Toyota has proven its commitment to Kentucky by supporting the \ninterests of the Commonwealth and giving back to our State in so many \nways. By contributing to education, the arts, local business leadership \norganizations, and supporting women's rights, this company has proven \ntime and again the importance of a strong business and community \npartnership.\n  Words cannot express the generosity that Toyota has shown Kentucky \nthrough industry job opportunities and community service. I am excited \nto see what this partnership will bring to Kentuckians and generations \nto come. Once again, I want to congratulate the Toyota Georgetown \nfacility and its employees on 20 years of success. I also want to thank \nthem for all they have given to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4689-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      EXTENDING THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE TRAVEL INITIATIVE DEADLINE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as my colleagues know, the Western \nHemisphere Travel Initiative, WHTI, currently requires anyone entering \nthe United States via a U.S.-Canadian land border to have a passport or \nother acceptable alternative document by January 1, 2008. I am pleased \nto join my colleagues from Alaska and Vermont as a cosponsor of their \namendment to extend the WHTI implementation deadline by 18 months to \nJune 1, 2009.\n  The WHTI will play an important role in securing our borders, but it \nmust be implemented in a reasonable, fair, and well-thought-out manner. \nThis amendment responds to concerns I have heard from various \nconstituents, including those in the travel, tourism, and shipping \nindustries.\n  My home State of Michigan, like other northern border States, enjoys \na close economic and social relationship with Canada. It is important \nthat the WHTI be implemented in a way that minimizes negative impacts \non trade, travel, and tourism.\n  We must ensure that our border crossings are both secure and \nefficient. This amendment would provide additional time for the \nDepartments of State and Homeland Security to study the various \nimplementation issues related to the WHTI. This delay would enable a \nmore in-depth examination of issues including the economic impact of \nthe WHTI, the civil liberties and security concerns related to new \npassport technologies, and the feasibility of creating a single border \ncrossing identification card that will satisfy the requirements of both \nthe WHTI and the REAL ID Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4689-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  On May 16, 2006, a 20-year-old Washington, DC, lesbian died after \nbeing shot in the head in what appears to have been a hate crime.\n  Crystal Smith died shortly before midnight when two unidentified men \nopened fire on her while standing on a street corner in Southeast \nWashington, DC. According to reports, the police department's Gay and \nLesbian Liaison Unit is assisting in the investigation. The fact that \nSmith was shot in the head makes it appear more likely that she was \ntargeted.\n  I believe that the Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4689-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4689-S4690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                           TAX RECONCILIATION\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I regret that rehabilitation \nfollowing back surgery prevented me from being on the floor to cast my \nvote against the tax reconciliation package which the Senate narrowly \napproved on May 11. Today President Bush will sign that bill into law, \nand I would like to take this opportunity to share my thoughts with my \nconstituents and my colleagues. I am extremely disturbed by the \nNation's fiscal mismanagement over the past several years, and this new \ntax cut bill was another disappointing step in the wrong direction.\n  On February 2, I voted for the Senate's version of the tax \nreconciliation bill. That legislation protected middle-class taxpayers \nfrom the alternative minimum tax and extended some widely supported tax \nprovisions that recently expired. The Senate bill also included \nurgently needed incentives for\n\n[[Page S4690]]\n\ninvestment in mine safety equipment and technology. I was pleased to \nsupport that bill.\n  Unfortunately, as I feared, during negotiations with the House, the \nreasonable compromise struck in the Senate was abandoned. The final tax \npackage that the conference committee produced has the wrong priorities \nand will make America's fiscal situation substantially worse.\n  Middle-class relief from the alternative minimum tax expired at the \nend of last year. The conference report extends AMT relief through 2006 \nbut does nothing about next year when millions of families will face an \nenormous tax increase. Additionally, the bill does not include the tax \nprovisions, which I have long supported, that help average West \nVirginians. Tax cuts which benefit families paying college tuition, \nschoolteachers buying supplies, and businesses investing in research \nand development were simply not included in this bill. These provisions \nhave already expired, meaning taxpayers will be hit with higher taxes \nthis year. I recognize that the Senate majority leader has indicated \nhis intention to address these issues later this year, and I will \ncontinue to advocate for extension of these important provisions. \nHowever, I believe it is irresponsible not to make tax cuts for middle-\nclass families our top priority.\n  Instead of addressing these urgent priorities, the bill acts to \nextend tax cuts for investors that were not even set to expire until \n2009. I cannot understand why tax cuts that primarily benefit taxpayers \nwith more than $200,000 in income would get a higher priority than tax \nrelief for middle-class families. Unfortunately, in West Virginia, very \nfew taxpayers have been able to benefit from the investor tax cuts \nenacted in 2003. Fewer than 17 percent of taxpayers reported any \ndividend income, and fewer than 11 percent of our taxpayers had any \ncapital gains subject to tax.\n  I am also extremely disturbed by the budget gimmicks used in order to \ncomply with the Senate's rules designed to impose fiscal discipline. By \ntaking advantage of unusual revenue effects, this bill amazingly pays \nfor tax cuts with yet more tax cuts. But without question, we are \ndigging ourselves deeper in debt with such games. In the long run, this \nbill will cost us even more than the $70 billion its sponsors claim. \nAnd because so many important issues have been left unaddressed, \nCongress will need to enact additional tax cuts this year. This fiscal \nmismanagement increases our borrowing from foreign nations and \nincreases the burden on our future generations.\n  Finally, I would like to mention the 18 miners in West Virginia, as \nwell as those in other States, who lost their lives this year and their \ndevastated families, friends, and communities. I am deeply disappointed \nthat this agreement does not include the bipartisan mine safety \namendment, which I worked so hard to include in the Senate bill. That \namendment would have encouraged mine companies to invest in additional \nmine safety equipment and training and, most importantly, would have \nsaved lives. This is a provision which cannot wait, and I will continue \nto push to have this provision enacted. The well-being and safety of \nminers demands it. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4690-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in 2002 Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct, providing important safeguards against unscrupulous accounting \npractices. In the wake of significant corporate accounting scandals, \nCongress created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board overseen \nby the Securities and Exchange Commission. It restricted the actions of \naccounting firms who perform audits--specifically preventing them from \nundertaking other activities which lead to conflicts of interest. At \nthe end of the day, this legislation is important to protect \nshareholders and employees from dishonest accounting practices that can \ncost them their futures and, in extreme cases, even their businesses.\n  Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires the Commission to create rules \nfor annual reports and to prescribe internal control reports to ensure \nthat financial reporting is accurate and ethical. The goals of this \nprovision are warranted but the burden on smaller publicly held \ncompanies has come at a great cost.\n  Unfortunately, they are also incredibly and unnecessarily burdensome \nfor small- and medium-sized businesses. In my State of Montana, it is \nthese small- and medium-sized businesses that fuel the engine of our \neconomy. Small businesses are collectively the largest employer in \nMontana, and it has always been important to me that the Federal \nGovernment consider the impact its regulatory policies have on small \nbusinesses.\n  For this reason, I am proud to be added as an original cosponsor of \nlegislation that will reduce some of the burden facing small \nbusinesses, specifically in section 404. S. 2824, the Competitive and \nOpen Markets that Protect and Enhance Treatment of Entrepreneurs Act, \nor COMPETE Act, will not remove the important safeguards that Sarbanes-\nOxley created, but it will increase the flexibility of the law to allow \nbusinesses to comply with the law with less hardship.\n  In 2004, the average cost for a public company to be public was $3.4 \nmillion. One out of every three dollars spent were for audits performed \neven if there was little or no value of those audits to the investors. \nIt defies common sense to have the same requirements for the largest \npublic companies as we do for the smallest, and the COMPETE Act will \noffer small- and medium-sized companies the option to comply with \nstandard internal control guidelines with enhanced internal controls, \ngreater transparency, and specific restrictions against conflicts of \ninterest.\n  One of the things I have learned here in Washington, DC, is that one-\nsize-fits-all solutions don't work. American innovation is too diverse \nto encompass through inflexible regulations. When we passed Sarbanes-\nOxley, our intentions were to protect investors and employees from the \nminority of companies that abused accounting practices to mislead their \nshareholders. This intention remains important, but in the past years I \nhave heard from Montanans about the unforeseen and unintended \nconsequences of this legislation. The COMPETE Act can sort these out, \nkeeping the goals of Sarbanes-Oxley intact, while increasing the \nflexibility needed to make the regulation as harmless as possible to \nhonest businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4690-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          COMMENDING THE USTR\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Abramson,\n     Chair of the Board, American University.\n     Thomas Gottschalk,\n     Vice Chair of the Board, American University,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Abramson and Mr. Gottschalk: I am writing to you \n     regarding the Finance Committee's review of governance issues \n     at American University (``AU''). AU is a federally chartered \n     non-profit, tax-exempt educational organization. Congress \n     enacted the law in 1893 that first incorporated AU, appointed \n     its initial individual corporate members, and specified the \n     size and composition of its board of trustees. Act of Feb. \n     24, 1893, ch. 160. In 1953, Congress enacted legislation, \n     altering, among other things, the process by which the AU \n     board of trustees is elected. Act of Aug. 1, 1953, Pub. L. \n     No. 183, ch. 309. The Finance Committee's review is \n     predicated on this unique history of the legislative \n     relationship between the federal government and AU as a \n     congressionally chartered institution, as well as on the \n     Committee's general legislative and oversight jurisdiction \n     over tax-exempt charitable organizations.\n       In conducting its governance review, the Finance Committee \n     has reviewed the numerous documents provided by AU and \n     material provided by other sources, as well as discussions \n     with current and former board members, faculty, students and \n     AU employees. In addition, I have heard concerns raised by AU \n     students from Iowa and their parents. To allow students, \n     faculty and staff, and the public to have a better \n     understanding of the governance issues still facing AU, I am \n     today releasing relevant material provided to the Finance \n     Committee. It says volumes about problems of AU governance \n     that students, faculty, and supporters often have to learn \n     about the work of the AU board from the U.S. Senate Finance \n     Committee rather than from the board itself. I understand \n     that governance changes are to be proposed that proponents \n     claim will ensure that there will be greater openness and \n     transparency at AU. I look forward to meaningful reform in \n     this area and expect to be informed of the details of those \n     proposals.\n       While I am releasing quite a bit of information today, I am \n     frustrated that there is certain key material that I cannot \n     release today. When the Committee began this investigation on \n     October 27, 2005, I received assurances of cooperation. The \n     Washington Post stated on October 28, 2005, ``Gottschalk said \n     yesterday that the board would do everything it could to \n     cooperate.'' Unfortunately, those words have not always been \n     met by deeds. While AU has over time provided material \n     requested, AU continues to redact material provided and most \n     frustratingly labels key documents' `confidential' and not to \n     be released to the public. This is not what I would expect \n     from a university that benefits from tax-exempt status and \n     was chartered by act of Congress. I call on you to hold to \n     your public commitments of full cooperation and allow for \n     public release of all documents without redaction that have \n     been requested. AU students, faculty and supporters have a \n     right to a full understanding of the board's actions.\n       One of my principal governance concerns relates to the \n     legal structure and composition of the AU board. The Finance \n     Committee, during its roundtable discussion on charitable \n     governance, heard from AU student leaders, faculty, and \n     former board members, a number of whom called for the removal \n     of certain AU board members--particularly focusing on members \n     serving on the ad hoc committee that took actions regarding \n     former AU president Dr. Ladner without the knowledge of key \n     board members.\n       In reviewing the material, I understand the views of those \n     who believe the members of the ad hoc committee should be \n     removed. In the course of our review, I have also focused on \n     several key votes by some AU board members. In particular, \n     given all related information reviewed by the Finance \n     Committee, I am seriously troubled by votes cast in October \n     2005: 1) to amend the audit committee's recommendation and \n     secondly to reject the audit committee's recommendations on a \n     vote for reconsideration; 2) to reject three identical \n     recommendations from counsel, including Manatt Phelps as well \n     as Arnold & Porter, that had concluded that Dr. Ladner's 1997 \n     employment agreement was invalid; 3) not to terminate Dr. \n     Ladner for cause; and 4) to increase cash severance to Dr. \n     Ladner by an additional $800,000 over eight years--after the \n     board had already voted to increase Dr. Ladner's cash \n     severance by $950,000.\n       It is important to bear in mind that these votes were made \n     after the findings from protiviti independent risk consulting \n     reports, which I am releasing today; were known to the board \n     and that provided in detail the expenses of Dr. Ladner and \n     his wife that he charged to AU. The report shows expenses \n     that would make for a good episode of `Lifestyles of the Rich \n     and Famous'--a lifestyle paid for by AU students and their \n     parents. In addition, as noted above, the board members were \n     aware of the findings of two respected law firms that found \n     that Dr. Ladner's 1997 employment agreement was invalid.\n       While I fully understand that as Chairman of the Senate \n     Finance Committee, I'm not here to direct the management of \n     the affairs of AU or its board, I do want you to know that I \n     am considering proposing federal legislation that would \n     require changes in the structure, composition, and governance \n     of the AU board, as Congress has done previously. In \n     particular, in discussions with Finance staff, AU board \n     members have noted that they do not view that under current \n     federal law the AU board has the authority to compel a board \n     member to resign. Please confirm if that is accurate, and \n     please also provide your views about the wisdom of \n     Congress amending the law to provide the AU board such \n     authority and, if so, suggested changes to the law.\n       In addition, I want to draw your specific attention to a \n     board meeting that discussed Mr. Ladner's compensation \n     package. In general, under federal tax laws, outside review \n     and justification for the salary of a highly compensated \n     individual at a public charity provides a safe harbor from \n     penalties under Section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code. My \n     review of tax-exempt organizations and corporations has found \n     that in the overwhelming number of cases outside consultants \n     provide a justification for the salary request that is being \n     considered. In fact, the AU situation is the only example \n     Finance Committee staff have seen of an outside consultant \n     stating that a salary of an individual at a public charity is \n     too high.\n       However, in calling for a salary for Dr. Ladner higher than \n     that recommended by outside consultants, some AU board \n     members appear to have rejected concerns about complying with \n     the laws passed by Congress and instead described financial \n     penalties for violating federal law as `de minimis.' Comments \n     that suggest that federal laws should be disregarded because \n     penalties are `de minimis' are stunning when I hear them from \n     members of for-profit corporate boards; they are shocking \n     when they come from board members of a tax-exempt university. \n     Do you believe this is the appropriate message AU should send \n     to students--it is all right to violate the law if the \n     penalty is de minimis? Please provide a complete explanation \n     of these events and your views of them, as well as all \n     related material.\n       The issue of whistleblower protection at non-profit \n     institutions has also been of great concern to me in the \n     course of the Committee's work. Whistleblowers in certain \n     situations are protected from retaliation under state and \n     federal law. A series of aggressive emails to other AU board \n     members by one AU board member appear to attack \n     whistleblowers trying to do the right thing regarding the \n     situation at AU. They include the following language: ``You \n     are right in citing a Nixon era example. People do not \n     tolerate leaks any more. No one is so naive anymore to think \n     that unidentified `whistleblowers' are public servants. You \n     are right in saying there always must be a process for people \n     to report wrongdoing but this is not the way.''\n       As a champion of whistleblowers in Congress for years, I \n     can state categorically that not only are whistleblowers \n     public servants, they are often heroes--saving lives and \n     taxpayers billions. I commend you, Mr. Gottschalk, and former \n     board chair Ms. Bains, for taking a strong line against any \n     effort to bring the Salem witchcraft trials to northwest DC. \n     But again, that a board member might propose retribution \n     against whistleblowers, as appears from some of these \n     emails.is inexcusable. I would appreciate your general views \n     on the benefit of whistleblower protection at tax-exempt \n     organizations, as well as your specific views on the series \n     of emails appearing to support aggressive efforts to search, \n     find, and punish those who try to speak out against what is \n     wrong. In particular, do you believe such efforts send the \n     appropriate message to AU students--especially given that a \n     large number of AU graduates will be employed in public \n     service?\n       Finally, let me return to the overall issue of governance. \n     In meetings with my staff, AU representatives have given \n     assurances that AU will have in place governance reforms that \n     will provide students and faculty a meaningful and \n     substantive voice at AU. I view this as a vital part of AU \n     governance reforms coupled with greater sunshine and \n     transparency that I mentioned at the beginning of my letter. \n     Please inform me in detail what the governance reforms are as \n     to students and faculty.\n       Given that Congress is currently considering reforms to \n     provisions of the tax code affecting charities as part of the \n     conference on the pension bill, I ask that you provide \n     answers to this letter within 10 working days. Thank you for \n     your time and courtesy.\n           Cordially yours,\n                                              Charles E.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the Indy Racing \nLeague, IRL, for its decision to use ethanol in its race cars and the \nimpact that decision has had on efforts to inform Americans about this \nimportant alternative fuel. Since 1911, Indiana has been the center of \nthe autoracing world, setting the standard in racing for drivers and \nfans alike. And now, the Indy Racing League is setting a new standard, \nthis time for greater energy independence.\n\n[[Page S4692]]\n\n  This year all of the IndyCars will race on a 10-percent ethanol blend \nbefore switching to a 100-percent ethanol fuel next year. With this \nchange, the corn harvested on farms across the country will power the \nfastest cars in the world.\n  The ethanol that will power its race cars will deliver the same high-\nperformance capabilities that drivers rely on, only without harmful air \npollution. It also represents an important step toward reducing \nAmerica's dependence on foreign oil, by providing a renewable energy \nsource grown in our own fields. By tapping the energy potential of \nAmerica's farm fields, we can ensure a reliable domestic energy supply \nto meet our Nation's needs while ending our reliance on unstable \ncountries such as Saudia Arabia, Russia, and Venezuela for their oil \nand creating thousands of jobs for Hoosier farmers.\n  Every Memorial Day weekend, millions of Americans and sports fans \nfrom around the world watch the Indy 500. But this year, when they tune \nin to see who wins the Brickyard, they will also be watching the future \nof American energy unfold at 220 miles per hour.\n  With its decision to use ethanol as the fuel for the IndyCar series, \nthe IRL is leading the way to encourage greater public use of renewable \nfuels. After all, if a high-performance vehicle can win the Brickyard \nrunning on ethanol, then surely ethanol is good enough for the family \nminivan, too.\n  I have introduced a bipartisan bill that will promote the use of \nethanol and other biofuels, and I will continue to support efforts to \nfind new ways to use ethanol in the future. I applaud the Indy Racing \nLeague for leading the way in this effort and, along with thousands of \nother Hoosiers, look forward to this year's ethanol-powered races.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4692-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AMERICAN LEGION POST 51 OF EAST POINT, GA\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the life of Chic \nHecht, a friend, a leader, and a great Nevadan. Chic served my home \nState and this country with honor, humility, and great devotion. He \nleaves behind the legacy of a true statesman, an intelligence officer, \na successful businessman, and most importantly, a committed husband and \nfather.\n  For me, Chic's legacy is that of a public servant who was fiercely \nloyal, unwavering in his principles, and an all-around decent human \nbeing.\n  Chic was drafted into the Army after college and served as an \nintelligence officer in Berlin during the Korean war. Chic retained a \nlifelong membership in the National Military Intelligence Association, \nand in 1988, was inducted into the Army Intelligence Hall of Fame.\n  Chic served in the Nevada State Senate for more than a decade before \nwinning a U.S. Senate seat in what has been called the biggest \npolitical upset in our State's history. During his term in the Senate, \nChic served on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee; the Banking, \nHousing and Urban Affairs Committee; and the Select Committee on \nIntelligence. In the Senate, Chic worked with President Reagan in \npersuading the Soviet Union to lift restrictions on the emigration of \nJews--a part of his legacy that will endure for generations. Chic went \non to serve 4 years as the U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas.\n  But it was Nevada that was always home to Chic. And Chic never lost \nthat down-to-earth, man of the people charisma that won him friends \nwherever he went. While his charm helped him make friends throughout \nhis life, it was his loyalty that made him a lifelong friend.\n  I will miss Chic. He was the first to step up when I was being \ncriticized, and he believed in me when very few others did. In \npolitics, you learn quickly who your real friends are, and Chic was a \nreal friend.\n  He left the Senate more than a decade before I took office, but I am \nwell aware of the impact he made. Chic was a great role model, and I \nhope to carry on his legacy and the lessons he taught me: to be \nfiercely loyal, unwavering in principles, and an all-around decent \nhuman being.\n  Chic will be missed, but he has set an example for us all to follow. \nGod bless him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4692-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4692-S4693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    THE DEATH OF SISTER ROSE THERING\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, New Jersey and the Nation mourn \nthe May 6, 2006, passing of Sister Rose Thering, a selfless luminary, \nwho was a leader in stamping out bigotry and intolerance and who \nbrought Christians and Jews together for increased mutual \nunderstanding. We were indeed lucky to have Sister Rose live in New \nJersey for so many years. From 1968, when she first came to Seton Hall \nin South Orange, New Jersey benefited greatly from her wisdom and her \ntenacity to act as a bridge between people of different faiths and \nbackgrounds. Sister Rose has made many contributions to the New Jersey \ncommunity. As a member of the New Jersey Holocaust Commission, she \nhelped write a 1994 law mandating the teaching of the Holocaust and \ngenocide in the schools in New Jersey. As a member of the Seton Hall \ncommunity, she forged an educational outreach program in Christian-\nJewish studies.\n  Last year, Sister Rose moved back to Racine, WI, to live with her \nSisters in the convent in which she initially entered religious life. \nMany in the New Jersey community sent her off with heavy hearts, \nknowing she was ill and knowing that they might never see her again. \nBut it was her wish to live her last remaining days with her Dominican \nSisters in Racine. As her life went full circle, the path she took is \nan example to us all.\n  In her early years, Sister Rose was dismayed at the disparaging \ncomments she heard about Jews. She learned from her teachers that Jews \nkilled Jesus; she heard whisperings of other anti-Semitic statements in \nher close-knit community. Concerned that a people were being unfairly \ntreated, Sister Rose made it her passion to fight anti-Semitism and to \nbring attention to the culprit Catholic texts in which anti-Semitism \nwas perpetuated. She wrote her doctorate dissertation on this topic at \nSt. Louis University. In 1965, the Vatican used her dissertation as a \nbasis for Nostra Aetate, the declaration that forever changed the \nrelations between Catholic and Jews.\n  Sister Rose continued her commitment to Jewish-Christian relations by \nforging strong bonds with the Jewish community. She was unconventional, \nfeisty, and strong willed always wanting to make principled decisions \nin support of her cause. She wore a necklace of the Star of David fused \nto the cross. In 1986, she protested the inauguration of President Kurt \nWaldheim, former U.N. Secretary General, because he had served in a \nNazi unit. In 1987, she went to the Soviet Union to protest the \ntreatment of Russian Jews. She visited Israel frequently, often \nbringing students with her. At a particularly vulnerable time for \nIsrael, Sister Rose decided to attend the Rally for Israel on April 15, \n2002 on the Mall in Washington, DC. Despite her poor health, when she \nlearned that there was no Catholic speaker on the program, she insisted \non speaking to show her solidarity. And as no surprise, it was Sister \nRose that was given the honor of giving the invocation.\n  Her legacy is great. It lives on in the documentary ``Sister Rose's \nPassion'' that won a Tribeca Film Festival\n\n[[Page S4693]]\n\nAward and nomination for an Academy Award for best documentary. It \nlives on the Sister Rose Thering Endowment for Christian-Jewish \nstudies, which has provided scholarships for 350 teachers for graduate \nwork on the Holocaust and other related topics. She will be missed for \nall her good work and for taking the difficult path toward greater \nunderstanding between peoples.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4693-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   IN CELEBRATION OF THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MARY CAMPBELL CENTER\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 30th \nanniversary of the Mary Campbell Center in serving people with \ndisabilities in Delaware. Since opening in 1976, the Mary Campbell \nCenter has touched the lives of literally thousands of people.\n  The center is located in Wilmington, DE, on 10 beautiful acres of \nland. The grounds were originally a farm owned by Amos and Mary Talley \nCampbell, whose daughter Evelyn had Down's syndrome. After his wife \ndied, Amos Campbell donated their land so that a special long-term-care \nfacility for Evelyn and other people with disabilities could be built. \nAnd that is how it came to be called the Mary Campbell Center.\n  The center was founded by a group of loving individuals--Marjorie M. \nAnderson, Richard P. DiSabatino, Sr., Barbara Z. Holmes, David W. \nHolmes, William H. Kelley, Joseph J. Picciotti, Jr., Marcia V. Raniere, \nCharles E. Welch, and Charma L. Welch. Each of these founders and their \nfamilies has given unselfishly to make the Mary Campbell Center the \nsuccess that it is today.\n  Since 1976, there have been many Mary Campbell Center milestones. The \ncenter has grown from having a handful of residents to 65 residents. \nThey benefit from around-the-clock health care, case management, \ncounseling, education, assistive technology, recreation, physician \nservices, physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, \nspeech and language therapy, hydrotherapy, exercise, nutritional \nservices, and transportation. Local families have come to depend on the \nMary Campbell Center for respite care. Residents and members of the \ncommunity are also benefiting from the center's unique educational \nprogram. Furthermore, over 200 children and youths with special needs \nand their siblings participate in various programs and summer camp \nexperiences. And the most recent venture, the day program, is expanding \nto serve even more families.\n  Physically, the Mary Campbell Center has gone from a compact building \nto a comfortable state-of-the-art and fully accessible facility with an \nindoor swimming pool, a learning center with the latest technologies, a \ngreenhouse, and an adaptive playground. There is even an accessible \nnature trail that is an especially popular retreat during spring and \nsummer. Today, more than ever, assistive technology is helping so many \nreach new goals and communicate with family and friends all over the \nworld. Community involvement is at an alltime high. Over 300 volunteers \ngive their time and talent to make a difference there. As the Mary \nCampbell Center enters its third decade, it continues to grow. Another \nexpansion to the building is about to get underway. The center is \ndoubling the size of their community room, the All-Star Room, and \nconstructing a basement. This will provide additional usable space.\n  I had the privilege of visiting the Mary Campbell Center earlier this \nyear. I was able to see first hand the difference the center makes in \npeople's lives. I rise today to thank the Mary Campbell Center \ncommunity for all that they do in Delaware, and I wish them a very \nhappy 30th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4693-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1165.

A bill to reduce temporarily the duty on automatic shower \ncleaners; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould temporarily reduce the duty on automatic shower cleaners on \nbehalf of S.C. Johnson, a company headquartered in Racine, WI.\n  I understand the importance of manufacturing and the role it plays in \nour everyday lives. It is no secret that the Bush administration has \nenfeebled the manufacturing sector, cutting needed funding that helps \nmanufacturers stay competitive. Since 2000, Wisconsin has been hit \nhard, losing 90,000 manufacturing jobs. A healthy manufacturing sector \nis key to better jobs, rising productivity, and higher standards of \nliving. Every individual and industry depends on manufactured goods. \nAnd the production of those goods creates the quality jobs that keep so \nmany American families healthy and strong.\n  This legislation would reduce the duty on automatic shower cleaners, \nan input S.C. Johnson refines to make high quality and affordable \nshower cleaners that eliminate the build-up of tough soap scum, mold, \nand mildew stains for the U.S. market. S.C. Johnson was created in 1886 \nas a parquet flooring company and today is one of the world's leading \nmanufacturers of household products including Ziploc storage \ncontainers, Windex glass cleaner, Raid insect repellant, and Glade \nfragrances. Today, S.C. Johnson employs 12,000 people and provides \nproducts in more than 110 countries around the world. In January of \n2006, S.C. Johnson was awarded the Ron Brown Award for Corporate \nLeadership for its outstanding achievements in employee and community \nrelations. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to repeal the imposition of withholding on certain \npayments made to vendors by government entities; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 2821, the \nWithholding Tax Relief Act of 2006. Today, President Bush signed into \nlaw H.R. 4297, the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of \n2005, and this afternoon, I am making good on a promise I made on the \nSenate floor last week--to repeal the expanded withholding tax \ncontained in H.R. 4297 to ensure that the bill does what its title \nclaims, that is, prevents tax Increases.\n  Americans have been asking for tax relief. Congress answered this \ncall, in part, when it passed the Tax Increase Prevention and \nReconciliation Act of 2005. The lower taxes on capital gains and \ndividends--and the higher alternative minimum tax exemption amounts--\ncontained in H.R. 4297 will assist small businesses, encourage the kind \nof investment that creates jobs and makes our economy grow, and ensure \nfairer tax treatment for middle-income families who would otherwise be \nleft footing the bill for a tax intended for the wealthy.\n  Alongside these tax relief provisions, however, conferees inserted a \nsweeping new withholding requirement that will raise taxes by nearly $7 \nbillion. This bill seems to have a history of that. When the original \ntax reconciliation bill came before the Senate, it contained a windfall \nprofits tax provision that would have imposed an additional $4.923 \nbillion tax on the energy industry. I voted against it because the bill \nthat was supposed to provide tax relief actually raised taxes. Although \nthe conferees stripped this provision in conference, they replaced it \nwith an even bigger tax hike--section 511's expanded withholding \nrequirement.\n  Section 511 of H.R. 4297 imposes a new mandatory 3 percent \nwithholding requirement on all payments for goods and services made to \nFederal, State, and local contractors. The provision, which is the \nlargest revenue raiser in the bill, represents a significant shift in \nU.S. tax policy.\n  Withholding has not always been around. Despite predominant public \nopposition, Congress enacted mandatory withholding on Federal income \ntax in 1943 in order to fund World War II. As a result, tax collections \njumped from $7.3 billion in 1939 to $43 billion in 1945. That is an \nincrease of $35.7 billion in just 4 years. In congressional hearings on \nthe issue, Congressmen spoke candidly of the revenues that needed to be \n``fried out of the taxpayers.'' There was no doubt in the minds of \nlawmakers that the result of withholding would be an increase in the \ntax burden on the public.\n  Congress sought to expand withholding to dividends and interest in \n1982, and public opposition was so profound that it was repealed 1 year \nlater. Now, proponents of section 511's expanded withholding \nrequirement say that it is necessary to close a ``tax loophole'' that \nallows taxpayers to avoid their tax obligations. There is no such \n``loophole''--the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, has simply failed to \ndo its job of collecting.\n  Information-reporting requirements are already in place to assist the \nIRS in its collection duties. Government entities are required to make \nan information return, reporting payments to corporations as well as \nindividuals. Moreover, every head of every Federal executive agency \nthat enters into contracts must file an information return reporting \nthe contractor's name, address, date of contract action, amount to be \npaid to the contractor, and other information. Expanding withholding \nwould now not only have the Federal Government spend taxpayers' \ndollars, but it would make taxpayers bear the burden and costs of \ncollecting them, too.\n  The costs of section 511 are high--so high, in fact, that the \nCongressional Budget Office said that the provision constitutes an \nunfunded mandate on the State and local governments, exceeding the \nannual threshold established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The \nprovision will also cause the cost of doing business to go up. A 3-\npercent withholding on multibillion dollar contracts--for as long as 15 \nmonths, held interest-free--will affect cash flows, investment, and \ncause businesses to raise prices in order to make up for losses, \nthereby putting them at a significant competitive disadvantage. \nConsider the Federal contract totals for Idaho and California alone. In \nfiscal year 2004, Idaho's nondefense contracts totaled $1.1 billion, \nand in fiscal year 2005, the State's defense contracts added up to $154 \nmillion. In fiscal year 2004, California's nondefense contracts totaled \n$9.4 billion, and in fiscal year 2005, the State had $30.9 billion in \ndefense contracts.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, the Withholding Tax Relief Act \nof 2006, will repeal the $7 billion withholding tax contained in H.R. \n4297. Tax relief should not be coupled with tax increases, and I will \ncontinue to work to give more meaning to the phrase in the bill's \ntitle, ``Tax Increase Prevention.'' This bill is a first step. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2821\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Withholding Tax Relief Act \n     of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REPEAL OF IMPOSITION OF WITHHOLDING ON CERTAIN \n                   PAYMENTS MADE TO VENDORS BY GOVERNMENT \n                   ENTITIES.\n\n       The amendment made by section 511 of the Tax Increase \n     Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 is repealed and the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be applied as if such \n     amendment had never been enacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mrs. Feinstein, and \n        Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2825.

It stretches 2,000 miles from California, through Arizona and \nNew Mexico to the southern tip of Texas and is estimated to have a \npopulation of 12 million residents.\n  The border region comprises 2 sovereign nations, 25 Native American \ntribes, and 4 States in the United States and six States in Mexico.\n  Why should we provide some focus to this geographic region? The \nsituation along the border is among the most dire in the country. In \nthe past, we have recognized problems with other regions, through the \nDenali, Delta, and Appalachian commissions, and have provided targeted \nfunding to those areas. The U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission, \nlegislation I sponsored\n\n[[Page S4699]]\n\nwith Senators McCain, Simon, and Hutchison, was created for the same \nreasons and annually receives about $4 million in funding that is \nmatched by $1 million from the Mexican Government for administrative \npurposes to improve international cooperation and agreements to tackle \nhealth problems in the region. However, we need to take the next step \nand provide resources to address the problems.\n  In the border region, 3 of the 10 poorest counties in the United \nStates are located in the border area, 21 of the counties have been \ndesignated as economically distressed, approximately 430,000 people \nlive in 1,200 colonias in Texas and New Mexico, which are \nunincorporated communities that are characterized by substandard \nhousing, unsafe public drinking water, and wastewater systems, very \nhigh unemployment, and the lowest per capita income as a region in the \nNation.\n  In a report earlier this year by the U.S.-Mexico Border Counties \nCoalition, the Coalition found that, if the border were a State, it \nwould rank second with respect to the uninsured, last with respect to \naccess to health professionals, including doctors, nurses and allied \nhealth professionals per capita; second with respect to tuberculosis, \nthird with respect to hepatitis; and fifth with respect to diabetes.\n  The result is a health system that confronts tremendous health \nproblems with little or no resources.\n  According to U.S. Census Bureau data reported in September 2005 for \nthe three-year average of 2002 to 2004, the states of Texas and New \nMexico rank first and second as the states with the highest uninsured \nrates in the country with rates of 25.0 percent and 21.0 percent, \nrespectively. California and Arizona are not much better and had \nuninsured rates of 18.7 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively.\n  However, the figures along the border are even worse, as the rates of \nuninsured are higher still than that in the four states overall. \nUninsured rates in many border counties are estimated to be above 30 \npercent and as high as 50 percent in certain communities. According to \nthe U.S. Census Bureau's small area health insurance estimates, SAHIE, \nthe three New Mexico border counties had an uninsured rate of 29.4 \npercent compared to the statewide average of 23.7 percent and more than \ntwice the United States rate of 14.2 percent.\n  As the U.S.-Mexico Border Commission notes, ``The border is \ncharacterized by weaknesses in the border health systems and \ninfrastructure, lack of public financial resources, poor distribution \nof physicians and other health professionals and hospitals. Moreover, \nthe low rates of health insurance coverage and low incomes puts access \nto health services out of reach for many border residents and thus \nkeeps the border communities at risk.''\n  The U.S.-Mexico Border Commission has identified and approved of an \nagenda through its Health Border 2010 initiative, which seeks to, among \nother things: reduce by 25 percent the population lacking access to a \nprimary provider; reduce the female breast cancer death rate by 20 \npercent; reduce the cervical cancer death rate by 30 percent; reduce \ndeaths due to diabetes by 10 percent; reduce hospitalizations due to \ndiabetes by 25 percent; reduce the incidence of HIV cases by 50 \npercent; reduce the incidence of tuberculosis cases by 50 percent; \nreduce the incidence of hepatitis A and B cases by 50 percent; reduce \nthe infant mortality rate by 15 percent; and, increase initiation of \nprenatal care in the first trimester by 85 percent.\n  However, the U.S.-Mexico Border Commission lacks the resources that \nare needed to address those important goals. The bipartisan legislation \nI am introducing today with Senators Hutchison, Feinstein, and Boxer \nwould address that problem by reauthorizing the U.S.-Mexico Border \nHealth Commission at $10 million and authorizing additional funding to \nimprove the infrastructure, access, and the delivery of health care \nservices along the entire U.S.-Mexico border.\n  These grants would be flexible and allow the individual communities \nto establish their own priorities with which to spend these funds for \nthe following range of purposes: maternal and child health, primary \ncare and preventative health, public health and public health \ninfrastructure, health promotion, oral health, behavioral and mental \nhealth, substance abuse, health conditions that have a high prevalence \nin the border region, medical and health services research, community \nhealth workers or promotoras, health care infrastructure, including \nplanning and construction grants, health disparities, environmental \nhealth, health education, and outreach and enrollment services with \nrespect to Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nCHIP.\n  We would certainly expect those grants would be used for the purpose \nof striving to achieve the measurable goals established by the Health \nBorder 2010 initiative.\n  In addition, the bill contains authorization for $25 million for \nfunding to border communities to improve the infrastructure, \npreparedness, and education of health professionals along the U.S.-\nMexico border with respect to bioterrorism. This includes the \nestablishment of a health alert network to identify and communicate \ninformation quickly to health providers about emerging health care \nthreats.\n  Mr. President, on October 15, 2001, just one month after the \nSeptember 11, 2001, attack on our Nation, Secretary Thompson spoke to \nthe U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission and urged them to put together \nan application for $25 million for bioterrorism and preparedness. The \nCommission has done so but has not seen targeted funding despite the \nvulnerability that border communities have with respect to a \nbioterrorism attack. Our legislation addresses the vulnerability of \ncommunities along the border and targets funding to those communities \nspecifically to improve infrastructure, training, and preparedness.\n  Our relationship with Mexico, like that with Canada, is a special \none. Those countries are our closest neighbors, and yet, we often and \nwrongly neglect our neighbor to the South and the much needed economic \ndevelopment needed in the region. Mexico is the United States's second \nlargest trading partner and the border is recognized as one of the \nbusiest ports of entry in the world. And yet the region is often \nneglected.\n  As the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission points out, ``Without \nincreases and sustained federal, state and local governmental and \nprivate funding for health programs, infrastructure and education, the \nborder populations will continue to lag behind the United States in \nthese areas.''\n  I would like to thank Senator Hutchison, who was an original \ncosponsor of the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission legislation, \nPublic Law 103-400, that we passed in 1994 and is the lead cosponsor of \nthis legislation today. She has also been the lead senator in getting \nfunding for the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission since its \ninception.\n  I would also thank Senators Feinstein and Boxer for working with us \non this important legislation and for their constant support over the \nyears for the work of the Commission.\n  I urge the adoption of this bipartisan legislation by this Congress \nand ask for unanimous consent for a summary and the text of the bill to \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2825\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), \n     Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced \n     the ``Border Health Security Act of 2006'' on May 17, 2006. \n     The legislation would improve the infrastructure, access, and \n     delivery of health care services to residents along the U.S.-\n     Mexico border.\n       The legislation would achieve these goals by--\n       Improving Border Health Services: Provides authorization \n     for funding to states, local governments, tribal governments, \n     institutions of higher education, nonprofit health \n     organizations, or community health centers along the U.S.-\n     Mexico border to improve infrastructure, access, and the \n     delivery of health care services.\n       These grants are flexible and would allow the community to \n     establish its own priorities with which to spend these funds \n     for the following range of purposes: maternal and child \n     health, primary care and preventative health, public health \n     and public health infrastructure, health promotion, oral \n     health, behavioral and mental health, substance abuse, health \n     conditions that have a high prevalence in the border region, \n     medical and health services research, community health \n     workers or promotoras, health care infrastructure (including \n     planning and construction grants), health disparities, \n     environmenta1 health, health education, and outreach and \n     enrollment services with respect to Medicaid and the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n       Providing Border Bioterrorism Preparedness Grants: Provides \n     for $25 million in funding to states and local governments or \n     public health departments to improve the infrastructure, \n     preparedness, and education of health professionals along the \n     U.S.-Mexico border with respect to bioterrorism.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand expand relief from the alternative minimum tax and to repeal the \nextension of the lower rates for capital gains and dividends for 2009 \nand 2010; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, President Bush is signing H.R. 4297, \nthe Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005. I opposed \nthis legislation because it contains the wrong priorities for America--\nleaving behind working families and substantially adding to the \ndeficit. This law chooses to extend the lower rates on capital gains \nand dividends for 2009 and 2010, but only addresses the individual \nalternative minimum tax (AMT) for 2006.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, those earning $200,000 \nor more will receive 84 percent of the benefit of the capital gains tax \ncut and 63 percent of the benefit of the dividends tax cuts. According \nto the Congressional Budget Office, 42.8 percent of taxpayers with \nincome between $50,000 and $100,000 will be impacted by the AMT if the \nAMT is not addressed for\n\n[[Page S4701]]\n\n2007--a number that increases to 66 percent by 2010. The Tax Increase \nPrevention and Reconciliation of Act of 2005 extends a tax cut that \ndoes not expire to the end of 2008 with a price tag of $50 billion, but \nfails to protect the hard working families that will be impacted by the \nAMT. These families were never intended to be impacted by the AMT, a \ntax originally designed to prevent a small number of high income \ntaxpayers from avoiding taxation.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that will address the AMT for \n2007 and repeal the lower tax rates on capital dividends for 2009 and \n2010. To calculate the AMT, individuals add back certain ``preference \nitems'' to their regular tax liability. These include personal \nexemptions, the standard deduction, and the itemized deduction for \nstate and local taxes. From this amount, taxpayers subtract the AMT \nexemption amount, commonly referred to as the ``patch'' which reverted \nto lower levels at the end of 2005. H.R. 4297 increased and extended \nthe patch for 2006. The patch was increased in order to hold the same \nnumber of taxpayers harmless from the AMT in 2006 as in 2005.\n  The problem with the AMT is that while the regular tax system is \nindexed for inflation, the AMT exemption amounts and tax brackets \nremain constant. This has the perverse consequence of punishing \ntaxpayers for the mere fact their incomes rose due to inflation.\n  A choice was made in 2001 to provide more tax cuts to those with \nincomes of over one million dollars rather than addressing a looming \ntax problem for the middle class. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001 did include a small adjustment to the AMT, \nbut it was not enough. We knew at the time that the number of taxpayers \nsubject to the AMT would continue to rise steadily. The combination of \nlower tax cuts and a minor adjustment to the AMT would cause the AMT to \nexplode. We are now approaching this explosion.\n  My legislation extends and expands the AMT exemption amount for 2007 \nto prevent additional taxpayers from being impacted by the AMT. Without \nincreasing and extending the AMT exemption for 2007, an additional 3.2 \nmillion taxpayers will be impacted by the AMT in 2007. In addition, the \nlegislation will allow nonrefundable personal credits such as the \nhigher education tax credits and the dependent care credit against the \nAMT for 2007. This legislation is offset by repealing the lower rates \non capital gains and dividends.\n  My colleagues in the majority argue that the extension of the capital \ngains and dividends benefits is necessary to provide investor \ncertainty. But I believe that the certainty of working families worried \nabout paying the AMT should come first. New data from the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation requested by the Ways and Means Democratic \nMembers shows that in 2007, 62 percent of all taxable capital gain \nincome will be recognized by taxpayers liable for the minimum tax. \nSimply put, taxpayers forced to carry the AMT burden will not benefit \nfrom the lower capital gains and dividends rate.\n  The AMT is a looming problem that is impacting hard-working families \nand for each year that we fail to address the AMT, it gets worse and \nmore expensive. We need to address the AMT for 2007. My legislation is \nnot a long-term cure to the AMT crisis, but it will provide certainty \nfor next year to hard working families that will be impacted by the AMT \njust because of where they live and the number of children they have, \nand it will address the AMT in a revenue neutral manner for 2007 as \nwell.\n  The Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005 addresses \nthe AMT for 2006, but at a price--providing a $42,000 tax cut to those \nmaking more than a million dollars a year. The AMT for 2006 could have \nbeen addressed in a bill that did not include the extension of \nadditional tax cuts and it could have been offset. Instead, addressing \nthe AMT for 2006 was included in a bill that will add far more than $70 \nbillion to the deficit.\n  We all agree that the AMT should not be impacting families with \nincomes below $100,000. I am concerned that we will not address the AMT \nfor 2007 in a timely and fiscally responsible manner. My bill does this \nand would give Congress time to work together in a bipartisan manner to \nfind a fiscally responsible permanent solution to the AMT.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to clarify \nthe investigative authorities of the privacy officer of the Department \nof Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Privacy \nOfficer With Enhanced Rights Act of 2006, POWER Act. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senator Lieberman, the Ranking Member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, in introducing this \nimportant legislation, which is a companion bill to H.R. 3041. The \nPOWER Act will strengthen the authority of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, DHS, Chief Privacy Officer, CPO, and will provide a much \nneeded check on government power.\n  Americans have an expectation that their personal privacy will not be \ninvaded and that their government will not misuse its powers. Democracy \nis founded on the principle that the people are the ultimate source of \nthe Government's powers. Recent events validate the suspicions of our \nNation's Founders against concentrating power into the hands of the few \nor in granting authority to those who are not accountable for how power \nis utilized. We need to consider the effects of intelligence and \ninformation gathering now that new government powers threaten to erode \nour most cherished freedoms and technological advances appear to \noutpace our ability to protect personal information.\n  In response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11, new law enforcement \nstrategies\n\n[[Page S4702]]\n\nwere created and information sharing between government agencies \nincreased substantially. DHS was established to face new challenges and \naddress new threats. However, we were concerned that the unprecedented \nsize and reach of the new department could intrude on the values that \nour nation cherishes most dearly. We wanted DHS to accomplish its vital \nmission, but we had to make sure that it was not at the cost of our \nliberty.\n  Times of crisis and unexpected trials do not excuse curtailment of \nour citizens' fundamental liberties, which is why the DHS CPO was \ncreated. The mission of the CPO is to ensure that the loss of the \nfreedoms that define this country would not be sacrificed for increased \nvigilance against our adversaries. Although I voted against the \nHomeland Security Act, I was pleased to work with my colleagues to \nestablish the CPO.\n  The DHS CPO has three primary responsibilities: (1) assuring that new \ntechnologies and information gathering methods do not erode personal \nprivacy; (2) evaluating the privacy impact of new government programs; \nand (3) investigating privacy complaints.\n  However, the CPO's powers have proved to be inadequate. The major \nproblem is that the CPO lacks subpoena power and, therefore, cannot \nfully investigate privacy violations. Instead, the CPO must rely on \nvoluntary submissions of information in order to conduct investigations \nwhich significantly weakens the office. We all remember the news \naccounts about how the CPO's requests for documents in her \ninvestigation of the Transportation Security Administration's, TSA, \ntransfer of passenger data from a major commercial air carrier to the \nDefense Department were rebuffed repeatedly. Our bill will go a long \nway to ensure that such situations will not happen again.\n  We are also concerned by the fact that the CPO cannot communicate \ndirectly with Congress, but instead, must report through DHS senior \nleadership. Similar to the Inspector General, the CPO can often be put \nat odds with those subject to investigation, so the authority to report \ndirectly to Congress and deliver unaltered findings is critical.\n  The POWER Act will address these shortcomings by providing the CPO \nwith the power to: access all records deemed necessary to do the job; \nundertake any privacy investigation that is appropriate for the office; \nsubpoena documents from the private sector when necessary to fulfill \nthe CPO's statutory mandate; and obtain sworn testimony.\n  To provide independence for this position, the CPO will submit \nreports directly to Congress regarding the performance of his or her \nduties, without any prior comment or amendment by the DHS Secretary. In \naddition, our bill would protect the CPO from retaliation by mandating \nthat the CPO cannot be removed from office without notifying the \nPresident and Congress of the reasons for removal.\n  With concerns over the development of new data mining activities at \nthe Department and the potential use of commercial data by TSA, it is \nessential now more than ever that the DHS CPO have the tools and \nauthority to protect the personal information of all Americans. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill and ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill and a letter of support from the American Civil \nLiberties Union be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2827\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Privacy Officer With \n     Enhanced Rights Act of 2006'' or the ``POWER Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORITIES OF THE PRIVACY OFFICER OF THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF HOMELAND SECURITY.\n\n       Section 222 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. \n     142) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) Appointment and Responsibilities.--\n     '' before ``The Secretary''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Authority To Investigate.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The senior official appointed under \n     subsection (a) may--\n       ``(A) have access to all records, reports, audits, reviews, \n     documents, papers, recommendations, and other materials \n     available to the Department that relate to programs and \n     operations with respect to the responsibilities of the senior \n     official under this section;\n       ``(B) make such investigations and reports relating to the \n     administration of the programs and operations of the \n     Department that are necessary or desirable as determined by \n     that senior official;\n       ``(C) require by subpoena the production, by any person \n     other than a Federal agency, of all information, documents, \n     reports, answers, records, accounts, papers, and other data \n     and documentary evidence necessary to performance of the \n     responsibilities of the senior official under this section; \n     and\n       ``(D) administer to or take from any person an oath, \n     affirmation, or affidavit, whenever necessary to performance \n     of the responsibilities of the senior official under this \n     section.\n       ``(2) Enforcement of subpoenas.--Any subpoena issued under \n     paragraph (1)(C) shall, in the case of contumacy or refusal \n     to obey, be enforceable by order of any appropriate United \n     States district court.\n       ``(3) Effect of oaths.--Any oath, affirmation, or affidavit \n     administered or taken under paragraph (1)(D) by or before an \n     employee of the Privacy Office designated for that purpose by \n     the senior official appointed under subsection (a) shall have \n     the same force and effect as if administered or taken by or \n     before an officer having a seal of office.\n       ``(c) Supervision.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The senior official appointed under \n     subsection (a) shall report to, and be under the general \n     supervision of the Secretary.\n       ``(2) Notification to congress.--If the Secretary removes \n     the senior official appointed under subsection (a) or \n     transfers that senior official to another position or \n     location within the Department, the Secretary shall--\n       ``(A) promptly submit a written notification of the removal \n     or transfer to Houses of Congress; and\n       ``(B) include in any such notification the reasons for the \n     removal or transfer.\n       ``(d) Reports by Senior Official to Congress.--The senior \n     official appointed under subsection (a) shall submit reports \n     directly to the Congress regarding performance of the \n     responsibilities of the senior official under this section, \n     without any prior comment or amendment by the Secretary, \n     Deputy Secretary, or any other officer or employee of the \n     Department or the Office of Management and Budget.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2006.\n       Dear Senators Akaka and Lieberman: The American Civil \n     Liberties Union commends you for introducing the Privacy \n     Officer With Enhanced Rights Act (POWER Act). This \n     legislation and its companion bill in the House, H.R. 3041, \n     are an important step towards ensuring that the Department of \n     Homeland Security's Privacy Officer has all the tools needed \n     to carry out the mission Congress envisioned for the office \n     when it created the Department of Homeland Security \n     (``DHS''). The POWER Act will allow the Privacy Officer to \n     better protect the privacy rights of all Americans by \n     providing important oversight of DHS, which handles extensive \n     amounts of sensitive personal information on Americans.\n       The original Congressional intention of the DHS Privacy \n     Officer's authority has not yet been achieved. The Homeland \n     Security Act of 2002 mandated the creation of a senior \n     official to assume responsibility for DHS privacy policies. \n     Specifically, this official is to assure that new \n     technologies do not erode the personal privacy of Americans, \n     evaluate new proposals concerning the use of personal data, \n     assure that DHS is in full compliance with the Privacy Act of \n     1974, and to report to Congress on an annual basis any \n     activities that impact privacy including ``complaints of \n     privacy violations, implementation of the Privacy Act of \n     1974, internal controls, and other matters.''\n       Congress, however, failed to endow this position with the \n     necessary investigative powers necessary to fulfill these \n     duties. Currently, the Privacy Officer must rely on voluntary \n     submission of information to conduct investigations. For \n     example, when the Privacy Officer attempted to investigate \n     the disclosure of JetBlue passenger information by the \n     Transportation Security Administration to the Department of \n     Defense, its requests for information were repeatedly \n     rebuffed preventing a comprehensive investigation. The \n     shortcomings of this process prevent the Privacy Officer from \n     being an effective advocate for the privacy rights of \n     Americans.\n       The POWER Act addresses these problems by providing the \n     Privacy Officer with the tools and independence necessary to \n     conduct investigations and thereby fulfill the duties charged \n     to the position by Congress in 2002. This legislation \n     empowers the Privacy Officer to access all records deemed \n     necessary, undertake any investigation deemed appropriate, \n     subpoena documents, and obtain sworn testimony. This \n     legislation also directs the Privacy Officer to submit \n     reports directly to Congress without prior amendment by other \n     Department officials, helping to protect the position from \n     internal censorship.\n       The POWER Act is an important piece of legislation to help \n     ensure that the privacy rights of Americans are not being \n     violated by their own government by providing crucial \n     internal oversight. We commend you for introducing this \n     important piece of legislation, the Privacy Officer With \n     Enhanced\n\n[[Page S4703]]\n\n     Rights Act, and pledge to work with you to ensure its \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n     Caroline Fredrickson,\n       Director.\n     Timothy Sparapani,\n       Legislative Counsel.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reed, Mrs. Clinton, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Landrieu, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 2828. A bill to provide for educational opportunities for all \nstudents in State public school systems, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kennedy, Reed, \nClinton, Sarbanes, Akaka, Lautenberg, Kerry, Landrieu and Menendez to \nintroduce the Student Bill of Rights. This bill would ensure that every \nchild in America has an equal opportunity to receive a good education.\n  The Student Bill of Rights would achieve this goal by providing \nAmerica's children with the key components of a solid education. These \ncomponents include highly qualified teachers, challenging curricula, \nsmall classes, current textbooks, quality libraries, and up-to-date \ntechnology.\n  Currently, Federal law requires that schools within the same district \nprovide comparable educational services. The Student Bill of Rights \nwould extend that basic guarantee of equal opportunity to the State \nlevel by requiring comparability of resources across school districts \nwithin a State.\n  Over 50 years ago, Brown v. Board of Education struck down \nsegregation in law. Over 50 years later, we know that just because \nthere is no segregation in law does not mean that it does not persist. \nToday, our education system remains largely separate and unequal.\n  All too often, whether an American child is taught by a high quality \nteacher, has access to the best courses and instructional materials, \ngoes to school in a new, modern building, and otherwise benefits from \neducational resources that have been shown to be essential to a quality \neducation still depends on where the child's family can afford to live. \nIn fact, the United States ranks at the bottom among developed \ncountries in the disparity in the quality of schools available to \nwealthy and low-income children. This gap is simply unacceptable, and \nit is why the Student Bill of Rights is so important to our children's \nability to gain the skills they need to be responsible, participating \ncitizens in our diverse democracy, and to compete and succeed in the \nglobal economy.\n  Of course, factors besides resources are also important to academic \nachievement--supportive parents, motivated peers, and positive role \nmodels in the community, just to name a few. But at the same time, we \nalso know that adequate resources are vital to providing students with \nthe opportunity to receive a solid education.\n  This bill is entirely consistent with America's historical commitment \nto equal opportunity. That is why 42 Senators voted for similar \nlegislation in the 107th Congress. On the other hand, it would be \ninconsistent with America's principles to tolerate an educational \nsystem that provides meaningful educational opportunities for just a \nselect few.\n  The quality of a child's education should not be determined by his or \nher ZIP code. The Student Bill of Rights will help ensure that each and \nevery child gets a decent education, and in turn, an equal opportunity \nfor a successful future.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthe Student Bill of Rights and I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2828\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A high-quality, highly competitive education for all \n     students is imperative for the economic growth and \n     productivity of the United States, for its effective national \n     defense, and to achieve the historical aspiration to be one \n     Nation of equal citizens. It is therefore necessary and \n     proper to overcome the nationwide phenomenon of State public \n     school systems that do not meet the requirements of section \n     101(a), in which high-quality public schools typically serve \n     high-income communities and poor-quality schools typically \n     serve low-income, urban, rural, and minority communities.\n       (2) In 2005, the National Academies found in their report \n     ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing \n     America for a Brighter Economic Future'' that the inadequate \n     preparation of kindergarten through grade 12 students in \n     science and mathematics, including the significant lack of \n     teachers qualified to teach these subjects, threatens the \n     economic prosperity of the United States. When students do \n     not receive quality mathematics and science preparation in \n     kindergarten through grade 12, they are not prepared to take \n     advanced courses in these subjects at the postsecondary \n     level, leaving the United States with a critical shortage of \n     scientists and engineers--a shortfall being filled by \n     professionals from other countries.\n       (3) There exists in the States a significant educational \n     opportunity gap for low-income, urban, rural, and minority \n     students characterized by the following:\n       (A) Continuing disparities within States in students' \n     access to the fundamentals of educational opportunity \n     described in section 102.\n       (B) Highly differential educational expenditures (adjusted \n     for cost and need) among school districts within States.\n       (C) Radically differential educational achievement among \n     students in school districts within States as measured by the \n     following:\n       (i) Achievement in mathematics, reading or language arts, \n     and science on State academic assessments required under \n     section 1111(b)(3) of the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)(3)) and on the National \n     Assessment of Educational Progress.\n       (ii) Advanced placement courses taken.\n       (iii) SAT and ACT test scores.\n       (iv) Dropout rates and graduation rates.\n       (v) College-going and college-completion rates.\n       (4) As a consequence of this educational opportunity gap, \n     the quality of a child's education depends largely upon where \n     the child's family can afford to live, and the detriments of \n     lower quality education are imposed particularly on--\n       (A) children from low-income families;\n       (B) children living in urban and rural areas; and\n       (C) minority children.\n       (5) Since 1785, Congress, exercising the power to admit new \n     States under section 3 of article IV of the Constitution (and \n     previously, the Congress of the Confederation of States under \n     the Articles of Confederation), has imposed upon every State, \n     as a fundamental condition of the State's admission, that the \n     State provide for the establishment and maintenance of \n     systems of public schools open to all children in such State.\n       (6) Over the years since the landmark ruling in Brown v. \n     Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954), when a \n     unanimous Supreme Court held that ``the opportunity of an \n     education . . . , where the State has undertaken to provide \n     it, is a right which must be made available to all on equal \n     terms'', courts in 44 States have heard challenges to the \n     establishment, maintenance, and operation of State public \n     school systems that are separate and not educationally \n     adequate.\n       (7) In 1970, the Presidential Commission on School Finance \n     found that significant disparities in the distribution of \n     educational resources existed among school districts within \n     States because the States relied too significantly on local \n     district financing for educational revenues, and that reforms \n     in systems of school financing would increase the Nation's \n     ability to serve the educational needs of all children.\n       (8) In 1999, the National Research Council of the National \n     Academy of Sciences published a report entitled ``Making \n     Money Matter, Financing America's Schools'', which found that \n     the concept of funding adequacy, which moves beyond the more \n     traditional concepts of finance equity to focus attention\n\n[[Page S4704]]\n\n     on the sufficiency of funding for desired educational \n     outcomes, is an important step in developing a fair and \n     productive educational system.\n       (9) In 2001, the Executive Order establishing the \n     President's Commission on Educational Resource Equity \n     declared, ``A quality education is essential to the success \n     of every child in the 21st century and to the continued \n     strength and prosperity of our Nation. . . . [L]ong-standing \n     gaps in access to educational resources exist, including \n     disparities based on race and ethnicity.'' (Exec. Order No. \n     13190, 66 Fed. Reg. 5424 (2001)).\n       (10) According to the Secretary of Education, as stated in \n     a letter (with enclosures) from the Secretary to States dated \n     January 19, 2001--\n       (A) racial and ethnic minorities continue to suffer from \n     lack of access to educational resources, including \n     ``experienced and qualified teachers, adequate facilities, \n     and instructional programs and support, including technology, \n     as well as . . . the funding necessary to secure these \n     resources''; and\n       (B) these inadequacies are ``particularly acute in high-\n     poverty schools, including urban schools, where many students \n     of color are isolated and where the effect of the resource \n     gaps may be cumulative. In other words, students who need the \n     most may often receive the least, and these students often \n     are students of color.''.\n       (11) In the amendments made by the No Child Left Behind Act \n     of 2001, Congress--\n       (A)(i) required each State to establish standards and \n     assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science; and\n       (ii) required schools to ensure that all students are \n     proficient in mathematics, reading or language arts, and \n     science not later than 12 years after the end of the 2001-\n     2002 school year, and held schools accountable for the \n     students' progress; and\n       (B) required each State to describe how the State will help \n     local educational agencies and schools to develop the \n     capacity to improve student academic achievement.\n       (12) The standards and accountability movement will succeed \n     only if, in addition to standards and accountability, all \n     schools have access to the educational resources necessary to \n     enable students to achieve.\n       (13) Raising standards without ensuring access to \n     educational resources may in fact exacerbate achievement gaps \n     and set children up for failure.\n       (14) According to the World Economic Forum's Global \n     Competitiveness Report 2001-2002, the United States ranks \n     last among developed countries in the difference in the \n     quality of schools available to rich and poor children.\n       (15) The persistence of pervasive inadequacies in the \n     quality of education provided by State public school systems \n     effectively deprives millions of children throughout the \n     United States of the opportunity for an education adequate to \n     enable the children to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (16) Each State government has ultimate authority to \n     determine every important aspect and priority of the public \n     school system that provides elementary and secondary \n     education to children in the State, including whether \n     students throughout the State have access to the fundamentals \n     of educational opportunity described in section 102.\n       (17) Because a well educated populace is critical to the \n     Nation's political and economic well-being and national \n     security, the Federal Government has a substantial interest \n     in ensuring that States provide a high-quality education by \n     ensuring that all students have access to the fundamentals of \n     educational opportunity described in section 102 to enable \n     the students to succeed academically and in life.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To further the goals of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (as amended by the No Child Left Behind \n     Act of 2001), by holding States accountable for providing all \n     students with access to the fundamentals of educational \n     opportunity described in section 102.\n       (2) To ensure that all students in public elementary \n     schools and secondary schools receive educational \n     opportunities that enable such students to--\n       (A) acquire the knowledge and skills necessary for \n     responsible citizenship in a diverse democracy, including the \n     ability to participate fully in the political process through \n     informed electoral choice;\n       (B) meet challenging student academic achievement \n     standards; and\n       (C) be able to compete and succeed in a global economy.\n       (3) To end the pervasive pattern of States maintaining \n     public school systems that do not meet the requirements of \n     section 101(a).\n\n               TITLE I--ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to reduce the addiction of the United States to oil, \nto ensure near-term energy affordability and empower American families, \nto accelerate clean fuels and electricity, to provide government \nleadership for clean and secure energy, to secure a reliable, \naffordable, and sustainable energy future, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nseeks to put America squarely on the path toward energy security for \nthe 21st Century. Today, I am joined by a number of my colleagues in \nintroducing the Clean Energy Development for a Growing Economy, or \nClean EDGE, Act.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is a sweeping proposal that \nincorporates the ideas of many of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle. It is our attempt to move America forward, on a pressing issue \nthat--as we've said many times before--poses one of the greatest \nnational security, economic and environmental challenges faced by our \ngeneration. I am talking about the issue of energy independence, and \nwhat it will take to put America on the right track.\n  The legislation we are presenting today is the result of a good deal \nof work within our caucus. As a member of the Senate Energy Committee, \nI speak from some experience when I say that developing a cohesive, \nnational approach to energy policy is quite difficult. That is because, \nin so many instances, there are important issues of regional diversity \nthat can divide us.\n  Instead of immediately succumbing to those divisions, what we did \nwhen we began to work on this legislation was to start with a goal. \nLike the Manhattan Project that established America as the world's \nfirst nuclear power, and the Apollo Project that ensured America won \nthe race to the moon, we recognized that initiatives of this magnitude \nmust begin with a goal. When America sets a goal, America will achieve \nit. It takes leadership and resolve, and it takes the shared commitment \nof individual citizens to make it a truly national effort. But make no \nmistake: the people of the United States will rise to the challenge.\n  Today, we can no longer ignore the enormous cost of America's \ndependence on foreign oil. It has become a crisis for consumers; it \nposes an imminent\n\n[[Page S4707]]\n\nrisk to our national security; and it jeopardizes our long-term \neconomic competitiveness. That is why we believe that America must \nstrive for an aggressive goal: to reduce our national petroleum \nconsumption equivalent to 40 percent of our projected imports by 2020, \nor about 6 million barrels of oil a day.\n  Next, we set out to define agreed-upon principles about the best ways \nwe could jumpstart our Nation's effort to achieve this goal. I am proud \nto say that we were able to achieve a good deal of consensus on these \nprinciples. Today, we sent the President a letter outlining them, which \ngained the signatures of 42 of my colleagues. These principles boil \ndown to this:\n  The United States must launch an aggressive effort designed to ensure \nthat an increasing number of new vehicles sold in America can run on \nalternative fuels--starting with 25 percent in 2010--and must launch a \nbold initiative to invest in the infrastructure needed to promote real \ncompetition at the gas pump.\n  The United States must ensure that consumers are protected from \ngasoline price-gouging and energy market manipulation.\n  The United States must lessen its reliance on fossil fuels and take \nsteps to curb greenhouse gas emissions by diversifying electricity \nsources to include more renewable resources.\n  The United States Governmment--our Nation's single largest energy \nconsumer--must help lead the transition by adopting the best available \nfuel efficiency and alternative vehicle technologies to reduce its \npetroleum consumption by 20 percent over the next 5 years, and by 40 \npercent by 2020.\n  The United States must level the playing field for new renewable and \nenergy efficiency technologies by providing incentives for consumers \nand manufacturers to develop and deploy the next generation of fuel \nefficient vehicles, and by ensuring that major oil companies pay their \nfair share in taxes and royalties owed to the American public.\n  These are the principles that guided us as we crafted the Clean EDGE \nAct. This legislation is a starting point, as we try to advance the \ndialogue about what it will take to put America on the path toward \nenergy independence.\n  There are provisions contained in this bill that we know can garner \nbroad bipartisan support. There are others that may not have been \npossible to enact, before America started waking up to the costs of our \nenergy independence. And there are other ideas that require broader \ndebate and close scrutiny within the Senate Committees of jurisdiction. \nThe Senate should work its will.\n  But once again, that is the point of this legislation: to start the \nprocess; to jump-start the debate, and outline a vision of where this \ncountry needs to go to secure our future.\n  As we have come together on this side of the aisle in recognition of \nthe need to address the pressing issue of energy security, I know I \nspeak for a number of my colleagues when I say I believe it is possible \nto come together in a bipartisan manner to pass energy legislation this \nsummer. It is possible, if the Senate decides to put politics and \npartisan rancor aside. We can roll up our sleeves and get to work on \ncrafting a real energy security plan that brings out the best in \nAmerica. That process would also bring out the best in the Senate.\n  So I am proud to introduce this legislation today, and look forward \nto working with my colleagues across the aisle in further developing an \nenergy independence plan for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/17/senate-section/article/S4707-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4707-S4710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               FEDERAL MINE SAFETY AND HEALTH ACT OF 1977\n\n  The bill (S. 2803), as introduced on Tuesday, May 16, 2006, is as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 2803\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Secure and Safe Detention \n     and Asylum Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The origin of the United States is that of a land of \n     refuge. Many of our Nation's founders fled here to escape \n     persecution for their political opinion, their ethnicity, and \n     their religion. Since that time, the United States has \n     honored its history and founding values by standing against \n     persecution around the world, offering refuge to those who \n     flee from oppression, and welcoming them as contributors to a \n     democratic society.\n       (2) The right to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution is \n     a universal human right and fundamental freedom articulated \n     in numerous international instruments endorsed by the United \n     States, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     as well as the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of \n     Refugees and its 1967 Protocol and the Convention Against \n     Torture. United States law also guarantees the right to seek \n     asylum and protection from return to territories where one \n     would have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of \n     one's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular \n     social group, or political opinion.\n       (3) The United States has long recognized that asylum \n     seekers often must flee their persecutors with false \n     documents, or no documents at all. The second person in \n     United States history to receive honorary citizenship by Act \n     of Congress was Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, in \n     gratitude for his issuance of more than 20,000 false Swedish \n     passports to Hungarian Jews to assist them flee the \n     Holocaust.\n       (4) In 1996, Congress amended section 235(b) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act, to authorize immigration \n     officers to detain and expeditiously remove aliens without \n     proper documents, if that alien does not have a credible fear \n     of persecution.\n       (5) Section 605 of the International Religious Freedom Act \n     of 1998 subsequently authorized the United States Commission \n     on International Religious Freedom to appoint experts to \n     study the treatment of asylum seekers subject to expedited \n     removal.\n       (6) The Departments of Justice and Homeland Security fully \n     cooperated with the Commission, which reviewed thousands of \n     previously unreleased statistics, approximately 1,000 files \n     and records of proceeding related to expedited removal \n     proceedings, observed more than 400 inspections, interviewed \n     200 aliens in expedited removal proceedings at 7 ports of \n     entry, and surveyed 19 detention facilities and all 8 asylum \n     offices. The Commission released its findings on February 8, \n     2005.\n       (7) Among its major findings, the Commission found that, \n     while the Congress, the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service, and the Department of Homeland Security developed a \n     number of processes to prevent bona fide asylum seekers from \n     being expeditiously removed, these procedures were routinely \n     disregarded by many immigration officers, placing the asylum \n     seekers at risk, and undermining the reliability of evidence \n     created for immigration enforcement purposes. The specific \n     findings include the following:\n       (A) Department of Homeland Security procedures require that \n     the immigration officer read a script to the alien that the \n     alien should ask for protection--without delay--if the alien \n     has any reason to fear being returned home. Yet in more than \n     50 percent of the expedited removal interviews observed by \n     the Commission, this information was not conveyed to the \n     applicant.\n       (B) Department of Homeland Security procedures require that \n     the alien review the sworn statement taken by the immigration \n     officer, make any necessary corrections for errors in \n     interpretation, and then sign the statement. The Commission \n     found, however, that 72 percent of the time, the alien signs \n     his sworn statement without the opportunity to review it.\n       (C) The Commission found that the sworn statements taken by \n     the officer are not verbatim, are not verifiable, often \n     attribute that information was conveyed to the alien which \n     was never, in fact, conveyed, and sometimes contain questions \n     which were never asked. These sworn statements look like \n     verbatim transcripts but are not. Yet the Commission also \n     found that, in 32 percent of the cases where the immigration \n     judges found the asylum applicant were not credible, they \n     specifically relied on these sworn statements.\n       (D) Department of Homeland Security regulations also \n     require that, when an alien expresses a fear of return, he \n     must be referred to an asylum officer to determine whether \n     his fear is ``credible.'' Yet, in nearly 15 percent of the \n     cases which the Commission observed aliens who expressed a \n     fear of return were nevertheless removed without a referral \n     to an asylum officer.\n       (8) The Commission found that the sworn statements taken \n     during expedited removal proceedings were reliable for \n     neither enforcement nor protection purposes because \n     Department of Homeland Security management reviewed only the \n     paperwork created by the interviewing officer. The agency had \n     no national quality assurance procedures to ensure that paper \n     files are an accurate representation of the actual interview. \n     The Commission recommended recording all interviews between \n     Department of Homeland Security officers and aliens subject \n     to expedited removal, and that procedures be established to \n     ensure that these recordings are reviewed to ensure \n     compliance.\n       (9) The Commission found that the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service (INS) issued policy guidance on \n     December 30, 1997, defining criteria for decisions to release \n     asylum seekers from detention. Neither the INS nor the \n     Department of Homeland Security, however, had been following \n     this, or any other discernible criteria, for detaining or \n     releasing asylum seekers. The Study's review of Department of \n     Homeland Security statistics revealed that release rates \n     varied widely, between 5 percent and 95 percent, in different \n     regions.\n       (10) In order to promote the most efficient use of \n     detention resources and a humane yet secure approach to \n     detention of aliens with a credible fear of persecution, the \n     Commission urged that the Department of Homeland Security \n     develop procedures to ensure that a release decision is taken \n     at the time of the credible fear determination or as soon as \n     feasible thereafter. Upon a determination that the alien has \n     established credible fear, identity and community ties, and \n     that the alien is not subject to any possible bar to asylum \n     involving violence, misconduct, or threat to national \n     security, the alien should be released from detention pending \n     an asylum determination. The Commission also urged that the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security establish procedures to ensure \n     consistent implementation of release criteria, as well as the \n     consideration of requests to consider new evidence relevant \n     to the determination.\n       (11) In 1986, the United States, as a member of the \n     Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner \n     for Refugees, noted that in view of the hardship which it \n     involves, detention of asylum seekers should normally be \n     avoided; that detention measures taken in respect of refugees \n     and asylum-seekers should be subject to judicial or \n     administrative review; that conditions of detention of \n     refugees and asylum seekers must be humane; and that refugees \n     and asylum-seekers shall, whenever possible, not be \n     accommodated with persons detained as criminals.\n       (12) The USCIRF Study found that, of noncriminal asylum \n     seekers and aliens detained, the vast majority are detained \n     under inappropriate and potentially harmful conditions in \n     jails and jail-like facilities. This occurs in spite of the \n     development of a small number of successful nonpunitive \n     detention facilities, such as those in Broward County Florida \n     and Berks County, Pennsylvania.\n       (13) The Commission found that nearly all of the detention \n     centers where asylum seekers are detained resemble, in every \n     essential respect, conventional jails. Often, aliens with no \n     criminal record are detained alongside criminals and criminal \n     aliens. The standards applied by the Bureau of Immigration \n     and Customs Enforcement for all of their detention facilities \n     are identical to, and modeled after, correctional standards \n     for criminal populations. In some facilities with \n     ``correctional dormitory'' set-ups, there are large numbers \n     of detainees sleeping, eating, going to the bathroom, and \n     showering out in the open in one brightly lit, windowless, \n     and locked room. Recreation in Bureau of Immigration and \n     Customs Enforcement facilities often consists of unstructured \n     activity of no more than 1 hour per day in a small outdoor \n     space surrounded by high concrete walls.\n       (14) Immigration detention is civil and should be \n     nonpunitive in nature.\n       (15) A study conducted by Physicians for Human Rights and \n     the Bellevue/New York University Program for Survivors of \n     Torture found that the mental health of asylum seekers was \n     extremely poor, and worsened the longer individuals were in \n     detention. This included high levels of anxiety, depression, \n     and post-traumatic stress disorder. The study also raised \n     concerns about inadequate access to health services, \n     particularly mental health services. Asylum seekers \n     interviewed consistently reported being treated like \n     criminals, in violation of international human rights norms, \n     which contributed to worsening of their mental health. \n     Additionally, asylum seekers reported verbal abuse and \n     inappropriate threats and use of solitary confinement.\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\n       (16) The Commission recommended that the secure but \n     nonpunitive detention facility in Broward County Florida \n     Broward provided a more appropriate framework for those \n     asylum seekers who are not appropriate candidates for \n     release.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To ensure that personnel within the Department of \n     Homeland Security follow procedures designed to protect bona \n     fide asylum seekers from being returned to places where they \n     may face persecution.\n       (2) To ensure that persons who affirmatively apply for \n     asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection and \n     noncriminal detainees are not subject to arbitrary detention.\n       (3) To ensure that asylum seekers, families with children, \n     noncriminal aliens, and other vulnerable populations, who are \n     not eligible for release, are detained under appropriate and \n     humane conditions.\n\n     SEC. __03.
