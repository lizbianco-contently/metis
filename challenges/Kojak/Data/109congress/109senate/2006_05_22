The \nsecond vote will be on the Ensign amendment which relates to the use of \nthe National Guard.\n  Other amendments may be offered today, and we hope to schedule debate \nand votes on those amendments.\n  I thank my colleagues for helping us move the bill forward to this \npoint. We will finish the bill this week, and I believe Senators will \nagree to reasonable debate on amendments and we can finish that bill in \nrelatively short order.\n  We have other issues to consider this week prior to the recess. We \nwill address a supplemental appropriations conference report when that \nmeasure is available for floor action. We also will be considering \nother conference reports that may be raised this week.\n  We have several important nominations that are available, or soon \nwill be available, after committee action for the full Senate to \nconsider. The Kavanaugh nomination is on the Executive Calendar and \nwill be voted on this week. Other nominations are in committee and will \nbecome available.\n  We have the nomination, for example, of Dirk Kempthorne, our former \ncolleague, to be Secretary of the Interior. This week the Hayden \nnomination may be available from the Intelligence Committee as well.\n  We have the nominations of Sue Schwab for the USTR and Rob Portman \nfor OMB--a number of nominations.\n  Needless to say, the days will go quickly, and we will need to work \ntogether in a collaborative, collegial way to get our business \ncompleted prior to the start of the recess.\n  Finally, in order to get all of this done, Friday votes are likely if \nwe are to complete this busy agenda.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4847-7", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This is \nsuch an important bill, and I hope in the planning which is taking \nplace that we will find some time to spend on that most important piece \nof legislation. I ask the majority leader if we have an idea how the \nsupplemental is coming along? The reason I ask the question is there is \nno end of questions coming to me and people saying it is really \nimportant to get this done before we leave.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on the Defense authorization, I have talked \nto both the chairman and ranking member, as I am sure the Democratic \nleader has, and have asked them to do their very best to address how we \ncan best bring that bill to the floor and have\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\nreasonable time for debate and amendment where we don't have to be \nstarting and stopping and starting and stopping like we had to do over \nthe last several years. Both of them are working very hard in that \nregard. It is a high priority.\n  I agree with the Democratic leader. We want to address it as soon as \npossible. The supplemental bill is in committee now. I have met with \nleadership involved in that bill, in terms of the managers on Thursday \nnight and with the House as well. I was advised to let them work hard \nand aggressively over these last what has now been 3 or 4 days, and I \nwill get a report back later today.\n  I, too, have been both advised and called by a number of people, both \nfrom the Department of Defense, our military, and it is clear that this \nmoney is needed. We need to work together to accomplish that this week. \nThat is my intention.\n  After I talk to our conferees later today, I can get back in terms of \nwhether that is going to be possible, but we are working very hard.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Iowa. I want to make a \nstatement. If the Senator from Iowa would allow me to suggest the \nabsence of a quorum so I can speak to the leader, and I will be back \nand talk, it shouldn't be too long.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I just finished a meeting in my office. It \nwas emotional, to say the least. Two mothers--both mothers of Marine \nCorps men--came to my office to tell me about their boys who were \nkilled in Iraq. I asked each of them to tell me about their sons.\n  Helena Lukac, of Hungarian ancestry, a beautiful woman, spoke with an \naccent telling me about her boy. He had better than a 4-point grade \naverage at Durango High School. He loved math and science. He wanted to \nbe an FBI agent or a CIA operative.\n  He told his mom: I am not sure I can do that because we came from a \nCommunist country. I am not sure they would let me do that.\n  He joined the Marine Corps when he was 18, and at 19 years old he was \nkilled.\n  Gloria Salazar's son was 23 when he was killed. He wanted to be in \nthe Marine Corps from the time he was little, but at the first attempt \nhe couldn't pass the physical. But he worked on his deficiencies and \ncame back and joined the Marine Corps. She was very proud of him. She \nshowed me a picture of his arrival in Iraq with his camera that he used \nwhich was part of his job in Iraq.\n  The mothers told the same story. They knew when their sons had been \nkilled.\n  Ms. Salazar was shopping in a mall, and that afternoon her son's \npicture kept falling out of her purse. She was so troubled she went \nhome, and during the day she went to sleep, which was unusual. The time \nwas assessed thereafter. She slept from the time he was injured until \nthe time he died. The same thing happened to Helena Lukac. She was at \nwork. She described her feeling as ``a nut with nothing inside it.'' \nShe felt empty.\n\n  I expressed to them my sorrow and sympathy and the appreciation of a \ngrateful nation for these two young men having given their lives. It \nwas a very emotional experience to hear the mothers talk about PFC John \nLukac killed in Anbar Province and CPL William Salazar in Karabilah, \nIraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4848-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4848-S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FORMATION OF IRAQI GOVERNMENT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, like most Americans, I welcomed the news \nover the weekend that the Iraqi political leaders had created parts of \na new government. It is certainly a useful step toward the kind of Iraq \nwe all want to see.\n  Like most Americans, I hope this new government will be able to bring \nsecurity and order to a country wracked by insurgency, extremist \nattacks, and sectarian strife. We know more work needs to be done, both \nwith forming this government and with fashioning a secure and stable \nIraq. Three of the most important security ministers are still unnamed. \nThat is hard to comprehend. We have been waiting and waiting for a \ncabinet to be formed, but is it really a cabinet? As unbelievable as it \nmay seem to many, there is even talk of disgraced Ahmed Chalabi filling \none of those security posts. That is hard to comprehend, but that is \nwhat the news accounts indicate.\n  I wonder how much longer this administration will insist that the \nburden of securing Iraq continue to fall squarely on the backs of our \nheroic U.S. troops, troops such as John Lukac and William Salazar. \nSecretary Rumsfeld was asked the question in Senate hearings last week. \nIt turned out to be a question he could not answer. This past weekend, \nwhen he was asked about the possible redeployment of U.S. forces in \nIraq coming home, going someplace else, Secretary Rice said that it \ndepends on the outcome of discussions with the Iraqi Government. \nApparently, Secretary Rice believes Iraqi leaders should decide the \nfate of our troops.\n  We are almost at the midpoint of 2006, the year a bipartisan majority \nin Congress said must be a year of significant transition. That is the \nlaw of the land. It passed on a bipartisan vote during the Defense \nauthorization bill. An amendment was offered and passed on a bipartisan \nbasis saying that the year 2006 must be a year of significant \ntransition in Iraq, with Iraqis assuming responsibility for governing \nand securing their own country.\n  Unfortunately, there appears to be little evidence of this \ntransition. In fact, we learned on Friday that there will be an \nincrease in U.S. troops to deal with the recent surge in violence. But \nnone of us should be surprised that this administration in this \ninstance is not following the law. It hasn't on many other occasions.\n  April was the deadliest month of the year for coalition troops. If \nthe current rate of violence is sustained, May will surpass April. The \nsituation is similar for Iraq's security personnel. More Iraq military \nand police were killed in April than any time in the previous 6 months.\n  Economically, the trends are no better. Oil production is still about \n400,000 barrels per day, less than it was prior to the war. Available \nelectricity in Baghdad dropped from 16 hours per day prior to the war \nto its current average of 4 hours per day. Clean water is below prewar \nlevels, and because of mismanagement and violence, only 49 of the 136 \nU.S. funded projects in the water sector will be completed. The rest \nhave been abandoned. All of these factors reduce Iraq's support for our \nactivities there and fuel anti-American sentiment and insurgent \nactivity.\n  While we all should welcome this partially formed new government, we \nrecall other political milestones that were achieved and quickly \nswallowed by more violence. For example, since the December election, \n325 coalition troops have been killed.\n  In order to ensure the milestone produces a different, more lasting \nresult, Iraqis, working with the Bush administration, must address \noutstanding issues surrounding their Constitution. They must form a \npolice force and diffuse the sectarian conflicts which have left their \ncountry on the brink of civil war, if not in a civil war.\n  Let's not forget that while the President and his team have chosen to \nfocus this Nation's attention on Iraq, we see resurgent Taliban \nactivity in Afghanistan. Iran and North Korea are thumbing their noses \nat the international community, and there has been a surge in terror \nattacks across the globe. Also, the mastermind of the deadly attacks on \nthis Nation, Osama bin Laden, remains at large, while his al-Qaida \nnetwork has morphed into a global franchise operation.\n  This is a time of great challenge for our Nation and for the Iraqis. \nGreat challenges require strong leadership. Today's speech by the \nPresident was yet another missed opportunity to provide that \nleadership. We heard little about his plan to engage Iraq's neighbors \nin finding a regional solution to\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\nIraq's problems. We heard little about his diplomatic efforts to end \nthe sectarian strife. We heard little about his thoughts on how to put \nIraq's reconstruction back on track. We heard little of what he is \ndoing to counter extreme ideology making such dangerous inroads in Iraq \nand around the world.\n  Instead of kicking the can down the road and letting future \nPresidents find our way out of Iraq, as we have been told by Secretary \nRice and the President himself will happen, it is time for the \nPresident to lay out the comprehensive strategy that our troops, our \nfamilies, and the American people have been waiting for. They have been \nwaiting a long time.\n\n  The Nation should no longer have to guess what is on the President's \nmind and grapple for some insight on what ``condition based'' \nwithdrawal actually means, a phrase the Defense Secretary does not even \nunderstand. We should all understand, a full-page ad in major \nnewspapers around the country, paid for by current CEOs, says Secretary \nRumsfeld should go. These are CEOs of some of the major companies in \nAmerica. ``Condition based withdrawal'' is a phrase the Defense \nSecretary does not understand. It is time for a clear plan that is as \ngood as the men and women who serve our Nation each day. It is time for \nthe Iraqi people to take control of their own country, their own \naffairs, and long past time for this administration to come up with a \nplan that places the burden of securing Iraq forces on Iraq itself. The \nburden of securing Iraq should be on Iraqis, not the United States. We \nhave done a lot. Even though the news over the weekend creating part of \nthe new government is a step forward, we still have a long way to go.\n  I apologize to my friend from Iowa for taking as much time as I did. \nI appreciate very much his courtesy, as usual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4849-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the time is now reserved \nfor the Senator from New Mexico to speak on the pending matter; is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about border \nsecurity and the immigration reform bill. I have some very strong views \non this issue because my home State shares its southern border with \nMexico. Every day I hear stories about the problems of lax border \nsecurity, a cause for concern among my constituents. They tell me \ndirectly the problems this causes. I am convinced we must do more to \nsecure our borders than we have been doing. However, I am very pleased \nwe are making headway. I hope, in the not too distant future, the \nAmerican people will see the fruits of that headway. I hope I can \nexplain in my time allotted how we are going to do more and what we are \ndoing.\n  Border security and immigration enforcement should be top priorities \nin our debate this week. Whether they are top priorities will influence \nmy vote on any border and immigration package considered in the Senate.\n  The first step to secure our border is more border security funding. \nI believe Senator Judd Gregg, as chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security, understands this. Sometimes it has \nbeen difficult to let the American people hear what is going on, what \nhe is doing in his subcommittee, what the Senate is doing when it \nfollows his lead, and what happens when we finish work with the House \non the bills that start out in his committee.\n  He helped us provide $635 million for border security in fiscal year \n2005 in an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. With his \nefforts, we provided more than $9 billion for border security and \nimmigration enforcement in the fiscal year 2006 Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. He worked to include $1.9 billion for border \nsecurity in the Senate fiscal year 2006 emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. Add that up, and one can understand that Congress \nis finally responding to the gigantic needs of making our international \nborders secure.\n  The fiscal year 2006 emergency supplemental funding I have alluded to \nincludes such items as $100 million for sensors and surveillance \ntechnology; $120 million for new Border Patrol stations, checkpoints, \nand vehicle barriers; $80 million for Border Patrol vehicles; and $790 \nmillion for border security helicopters and other air assets. Believe \nit or not, until recently, while we have talked a great deal about the \nBorder Patrol and what they must do, they had helicopters from the \nVietnam era. We have finally decided to buy them a new fleet of \nhelicopters. After all these years of talking, we are finally doing \nsomething. Also, we included $50 million for an upgraded CBP \ncommunications system.\n  Many Americans must be wondering, what have we been doing all these \nyears in all these appropriations bills when we have talked so much? \nThe truth is, we have done little. But we are doing more now.\n  Second, we need more border security provisions as part of border \nsecurity and immigration reform legislation. Many security provisions \nin the current border and immigration bill are good, but they are not \nenough. I have filed three amendments to the bill which I will discuss \nshortly. I understand and think once Senators have heard these \namendments and the managers have had a chance to review them, they may \nbe accepted.\n  Lastly, we should try to address what to do with the millions of \nundocumented workers in America today. In March, I joined with a \nbipartisan group of Senators to support what has been called the Hagel-\nMartinez compromise. I supported the compromise in hopes that it would \nallow a border security and immigration bill to move forward. I also \nsupported it because, as I understand the bill, anyone who came to the \nUnited States illegally after January 7 of 2004 receives no special \ntreatment; that is, those hundreds of thousands of people who have been \nrunning to the border or who have been taken to the border, who have \npurchased their way to the border in the last few months, will receive \nno special treatment. It is my understanding these individuals--that \nis, post-January 7, 2004 illegal entrants--would be subject to removal \nand deportation under existing immigration laws. The record needs to \nclearly reflect that.\n  That means one group of people that Americans are wondering about \nwill not receive any special privileges under this bill. They are sort \nof the Johnny-come-latelies who have run to the border thinking if they \ncan get here quick enough they will be included in our immigration \nreform efforts. But it is my understanding that these individuals would \nbe subject to removal and deportation under existing immigration law. I \nrepeat that because I believe a number of Senators, on this side of the \naisle at least, are indicating their support for this bill because they \nbelieve that is in the bill.\n  As the most senior Senator representing a southwest border State, I \nwould like to now discuss the amendments I have filed, which I believe \nmake eminent sense and should be accepted by the Senate.\n  The first is an amendment regarding Mexican cooperation. This \namendment will require the Secretary of State to cooperate with Mexico \nto improve border security and to reduce border crime. The amendment is \nthe result of a lot of hard work and is cosponsored by the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, who is very familiar \nwith the border problems and the problems with Mexico.\n  I would like to read that amendment because a reading of it does more \nthan\n\n[[Page S4850]]\n\nI could do by trying to summarize it. This amendment has as its \npurpose:\n\n       To improve coordination between the United States and \n     Mexico regarding border security, criminal activity, circular \n     migration, and for other purposes.\n       (a) Cooperation Regarding Border Security.--The Secretary \n     of State, in cooperation with the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security and representatives of Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement agencies that are involved in border security and \n     immigration enforcement efforts, shall work with the \n     appropriate officials from the Government of Mexico to \n     improve coordination between the United States and Mexico \n     regarding--\n       (1) improved border security along the international border \n     between the United States and Mexico;\n       (2) the reduction of human trafficking and smuggling \n     between the United States and Mexico;\n       (3) the reduction of drug traffic and smuggling between the \n     United States and Mexico;\n       (4) the reduction of gang membership in the United States \n     and Mexico;\n       (5) the reduction of violence against women in the United \n     States and Mexico; and\n       (6) the reduction of other violence and criminal activity.\n\n  Next:\n\n       (b) Cooperation Regarding Education On Immigration Laws.--\n     The Secretary of State, in cooperation with other appropriate \n     Federal officials, shall work with the appropriate officials \n     from the Government of Mexico to carry out activities to \n     educate citizens and nationals of Mexico regarding \n     eligibility for status as a non-immigrant under United \n     States' law to ensure that the citizens and nationals are not \n     exploited while working in the United States.\n       (c) Cooperation Regarding Circular Migration.--The \n     Secretary of State, in cooperation with the Secretary of \n     Labor and other appropriate Federal officials, shall work \n     with the appropriate officials from the Government of Mexico \n     to improve coordination between the United States and Mexico \n     to encourage circular migration, including assisting in the \n     development of economic opportunities and providing job \n     training for citizens and nationals in Mexico.\n       (d) Annual Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     actions taken by the United States and Mexico under this \n     section.\n\n  I believe this amendment is absolutely necessary, and I am very \npleased Senator Dodd has joined me in supporting the amendment. I hope \nthis will become part of this bill. My amendment will require an annual \nreport which I think will push the leaders of Mexico to do the kinds of \nthings that Americans expect these two countries to do. If we do not \nwork together, we will have chaos. But with an agreement to work \ntogether on these issues, annually the people of both countries should \nknow what is going on in terms of cooperation in the areas I have just \nspoken to.\n  Now, sources estimate that as much as 85 percent of apprehended \nillegal immigrants are from Mexico. So we must work with Mexico to \naddress the security of our southern border and the number of illegal \nentries from Mexico.\n  My amendment calls on the Secretary of State to work with Mexico to \nimprove border security; reduce human smuggling, drug trafficking, \nviolence against women, and to inform Mexican nationals of the benefits \nof U.S. immigration. I have just read the amendment in its entirety on \neach of these subjects.\n  Mexico must do its part in this initiative.\n  On Sunday, there was an Associated Press article titled ``Mexico \nWorks to Bar Non-Natives from Jobs.'' That article says--and I quote--\n\n       Even as Mexico presses the United States to grant \n     unrestricted citizenship to millions of undocumented Mexican \n     migrants, its officials at times calling U.S. policies \n     ``xenophobic,'' Mexico places daunting limitations on anyone \n     born outside its territory.\n\n  Mexico expects us to have much more humane, much more liberal, and \nmuch more constructive immigration policies in our Nation than it is \nwilling to implement within its own borders. Can you imagine the uproar \nif we were to try to make our immigration policies anything like the \npolicies of Mexico?\n  In addition to changing its own immigration policies, Mexico has some \nother responsibilities, in my view. How many of its citizens, seeking \neconomic sustenance, does Mexico expect us to take before it reforms \nits own economic policies?\n  Estimates released over the weekend reveal that about 10 percent of \nthe Mexican workforce now works not in its homeland but in the United \nStates, and that 10 percent provides about 15 percent of the Mexican \nnational income.\n  We have an unusual, perhaps unique, situation along the border \nbetween the United States and Mexico. On no other border of this length \nin the world does such a disparity exist between the economic prowess \nand programs of the two nations sharing such a border.\n  Here is America, the leading economy in the world, bordered for \nalmost 2,000 miles by a nation that persists in economic policies that \nhave failed to provide sufficient jobs or salaries for much of its \npeople. No similar situation exists anywhere on the globe. So we have a \nunique challenge that is attendant to this unique situation.\n\n  That challenge needs to be met not just by the United States, but by \nMexico, too. They must join us in an effort to solve this challenge. \nEconomic reform, greater emphasis on the private economy, and \nmodernizing more of its facilities remain great challenges that Mexico \nmust face.\n  We are forced to tighten our borders not because we are a mean \nnation, but because the economy to the south of us is driving millions \nto our country's economy. I believe my amendment will provide for more \ncooperation between the United States and Mexico. As a result, I \nbelieve our border could be more secure.\n  I have another amendment that has to do with Federal judges. I note \nthe distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is on the \nSenate floor, and her state is impacted by this amendment. It has to do \nwith the inadequate number of Federal judges that is going to result \nwhen this new law is put into effect. The U.S. district courts in the \nsouthwest are overly burdened with immigration caseloads. We must have \nadditional judges, as recommended by the 2005 Judicial Conference.\n  Let me explain. While immigration cases typically go before \nimmigration judges, repeat offenders can be charged with felonies and \ntried in Federal district court. As a result, four of our district \ncourts have immigration caseloads that total more than 50 percent of \ntheir total criminal filings.\n  The fiscal year 2004 immigration caseload for the Southern District \nof Texas totaled 3,668 filings. This is more than 65 percent of the \ndistrict's 5,599 criminal filings.\n  The District Court for Arizona had 2,404 immigration filings, more \nthan 59 percent of the district's 4,007 criminal filings.\n  The Southern District of California had 2,206 immigration filings. \nThat is more than 64 percent of its total 3,400 criminal filings.\n  The district court for my home State of New Mexico had 1,502 \nimmigration filings. That is more than 60 percent of its total of 2,497 \ncriminal filings.\n  I am glad we are improving border security and interior enforcement \nwith this legislation. But, obviously, we must also provide the \nadequate machinery to go along with that, and that means enough Federal \njudges to handle the caseload that will be generated.\n  In short, if we put more Border Patrol agents and immigration \npersonnel on the southwestern border, we need to provide more resources \nto the other Federal agencies that also deal with immigration.\n  The immigration bill recognizes this to some degree by calling for \nmore DHS and DOJ attorneys, public defenders, and immigration judges. \nBut we must add new district judges necessary to hear the cases of \nrepeat immigration law violators. Failure to do that means we will \ncreate even more of an unworkable situation that already involves mass \narraignments and sentencings.\n  As we work on this bill to provide more resources to the Departments \nof Homeland Security and Justice, we must also address related needs, \nso I am proud to offer this amendment with Senators Kyl, Cornyn, and \nHutchison.\n  I also address a related need for more deputy marshals in an \namendment. We have a dramatic shortage of deputy marshals to handle the \nincreased caseload that will be associated with repeat immigration law \nviolators. My third amendment, offered with Senators Bingaman, Kyl, \nCornyn, and Hutchison, awaits consideration. It adds 50 new deputy \nmarshals each year for 5 years.\n  Lastly, I would just comment on a very important part of the bill, \nthe land port-of-entry improvements sections. Those provisions are \nbased on\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\nlegislation I authored in the 108th Congress with Senator Dorgan and \nwhich 13 other border state Senators cosponsored.\n  These provisions address the needs of our land ports of entry.\n  I am grateful that the managers of the bill have adopted that \nlegislation as part of their bill. These sections are critical because \nneither American border has undergone a comprehensive infrastructure \noverhaul since Senator DeConcini, a Senator from Arizona, and I put \nforth an effort to modernize the southwest border 20 years ago. We have \ndone nothing comprehensive since 1986 on either the north or south \ninternational border. A great deal has changed since then, including \nthe passage of legislation to improve security of our airports and \nseaports, following September 11, 2001.\n  I appreciate Chairman Specter including my legislation to identify \nport-of-entry infrastructure and technology improvement projects, \nprioritize and implement these projects based on need, require a plan \nto assess the vulnerabilities of each of the ports of entry located on \nthe northern and southern borders of our great Nation, implement a \ntechnology demonstration program to evaluate new ports of entry \ntechnologies, and provide training necessary for personnel who must \nimplement these new technologies. I believe these provisions are \nessential for border security. I am glad and appreciative that they are \nin the bill.\n  Mr. President, we must secure our international borders. I believe \nwith Chairman Gregg's leadership on the Homeland Security \nAppropriations Subcommittee and strong border security provisions in \nthis bill, we can do just that.\n  I thank the Chair for the time granted me to express my views and to \nthe Senators who have listened. Certainly, I hope what I have said will \nhave an impact to some extent on this bill and that the amendments that \nhave not yet been adopted, of which I have spoken, will, before we come \nto final closure, become part of this great effort to secure our \nborders, provide for an orderly transition for those who have come to \nour country illegally, and create orderly rules for future guest \nworkers. This is important so the relationships between America and \nother countries can move forward, and so our country, which is going to \nneed immigrants in the future, can look forward to that in an orderly \nmanner based on a border that is secure and an agreement between the \nU.S. and Mexico that is going to be carried out and rendered operative.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4087\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico for his thoughtful comments on the bill. I have the \nprivilege of serving as a member of the Energy Committee, of which he \nis chairman. It has been a pleasure for me to serve under his \nchairmanship. I thank him for those comments.\n  I come to the floor to discuss an amendment, SA 4087, which I filed \nthis morning. It is entitled ``To modify the Conditions Under Which \nAliens Who Are Unlawfully Present in the United States Are Granted \nLegal Status.'' I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin be added as \na cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that letters of support for \nthe amendment from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and over 115 \ngroups and organizations from around the country be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There, being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Congress of the\n\n\n                                                United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: We write to express our strong support of the \n     Feinstein amendment to S. 2611 and ask you to vote for it \n     when considered on the Senate floor.\n       The Feinstein ``orange card'' amendment would simplify the \n     implementation of the legalization program considerably, \n     creating a uniform and tough path to permanency for all hard-\n     working undocumented immigrants living in the United States--\n     without providing them an automatic pardon or amnesty.\n       To qualify, undocumented individuals would be required to \n     have been physically present in the United States and working \n     by January 1, 2006. They would have to pay a $2000 fine and \n     back taxes, learn English and American civics, and pass \n     extensive criminal and security background check. After \n     working for at least 6 years, orange card holders could apply \n     for legal permanent residence, but only after all current \n     applicants for a green card are adjudicated.\n       S. 2611, as currently drafted, creates a complicated, \n     three-tiered process that could undermine the success of the \n     legalization program. We fear that without amendment, the \n     legalization program will be costly and difficult to \n     administer, prone to widespread fraud and inherently unfair \n     to those that it would, perhaps even inadvertently, exclude.\n       It is our position that for a comprehensive approach to \n     work, immigration reform must be tough and enforceable and \n     bring as many undocumented individuals out of the shadows as \n     possible. If reform fails to do this, we will be wasting an \n     important and historic opportunity to get at the root of the \n     problem with our immigration policy. Rather than fixing our \n     broken system once and for all, S. 2611 could postpone our \n     ability to get control of migration flows into our country \n     and secure our homeland.\n       The Feinstein amendment would strengthen the effectiveness \n     and fairness of S. 2611, and is, therefore, in the best \n     interests of all Americans. We urge you to vote yes on the \n     Feinstein amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Grace Flores Napolitano,\n       Chair, Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC).\n     Luis V. Gutierrez,\n       Chair, CHC Immigration Task Force.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Coalition for Comprehensive\n\n\n                                           Immigration Reform.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we are writing to express our strong support for the \n     Feinstein ``Orange Card'' amendment which replaces the three-\n     tiered treatment of undocumented immigrants in S. 2611 with \n     one simple process that applies to undocumented immigrants \n     who lived in the U.S. on January 1, 2006 and meet other \n     strict requirements including paying taxes, learning English, \n     passing criminal and security background checks, and paying a \n     $2000 fine.\n       Under the Feinstein amendment Orange Card holders may \n     become lawful permanent residents when all current applicants \n     for green cards have been received from them (estimated to be \n     6 years), or 8 years after the bill becomes law, whichever is \n     earlier. This means that they are essentially ``in line'' \n     behind those who are currently awaiting visas through our \n     legal immigration system. Orange Card holders must check in \n     each year with the government and show that they continue to \n     meet all of the requirements listed above.\n       There are numerous other important advantages of the \n     Feinstein Orange Card amendment including: one simple process \n     to legalize qualifying undocumented immigrants who entered \n     the U.S. before January 1, 2006; equal treatment of all \n     family members; and ease of administration with less \n     potential for fraud. Moreover, the amendment increases the \n     effectiveness of comprehensive immigration reform by \n     maximizing the extent to which undocumented immigrants \n     currently in the United States can access a path to U.S. \n     citizenship.\n       We are deeply concerned that S. 2611 will exclude too many \n     immigrants who are hard working, law abiding, and making \n     important contributions to this country. We believe the best \n     way to reform the law is to maximize the number of immigrants \n     who legalize and to create a process that works. We urge you \n     to recognize the many contributions that these immigrants \n     make to our country and provide a path to citizenship which \n     is consistent with the spirit of S. 2611 in that immigrants \n     would have to meet the same requirements for working paying \n     taxes, learning English, and waiting in line behind others \n     but without creating unnecessary and cumbersome parallel \n     processes which will be difficult to administer and will \n     leave too many behind.\n       We strongly support the Feinstein Orange Card amendment and \n     urge you to support it.\n           Sincerely,\n       ACORN; Aceramiento Hispano de Carolina del Sur; The \n     American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee; American Friends \n     Service Committee, Miami; Asian American Justice Center; \n     Asian Americans for Equality; Association of Mexicans in \n     North Carolina (AMEXCAN); CASA of Maryland, Inc.; Center for \n     Community Change; The Center for Justice, Peace and the \n     Environment; Center for Social Advocacy; Central American \n     Resource Center/CARECEN-L.A.; Centro Campesino Inc.; \n     Coalition for Asian American Children and Families (CACF); \n     Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles \n     (CHIRLA); Coalition for New South Carolinians; Community \n     Wellness Partnership of Pomona; Dignity Through Dialogue and \n     Education; Eastern Pennsylvania Conference of the United \n     Methodist Church; El Centro Hispanoamericano; El Centro, \n     Inc.; Empire Justice Center; En Camino, Diocese of Toledo; \n     FIRM (Fair Immigration Reform Movement); Family & Children's \n     Service; Fanm Ayisyen Nan Miyami/Haitian Women of Miami, \n     Inc.; The Farmworker Association of Florida Inc.; Farmworkers \n     Association of Florida; Florida Immigrant Coalition;\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\n     Fuerza Latina; Fundacion Salvadorena de la Florida; Georgia \n     Association of Latino Elected Officials (GALEO); Guatemalan \n     Unity Information Agency; Haitian Women of Miami; HIAS and \n     Council Migration Service of Philadelphia; Heartland \n     Alliance; Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS); Hispanic \n     American Association; Hispanic Coalition, Miami; Hispanic \n     Federation; Hispanic Women's Organization of Arkansas; Holy \n     Redeemer Lutheran Church, San Jose, CA; ISAIAH, Twin Cities \n     and St. Cloud Regions, MN; Illinois Coalition for Immigration \n     and Refugee Rights; Interfaith Coalition for Immigrant \n     Rights, California; Interfaith Coalition for Worker Justice \n     of South Central Wisconsin (ICWJ); Intl.

Mr. President, I make these remarks as a 13\\1/2\\-year \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Immigration \nSubcommittee. I also come from a State which is very large in terms of \nimmigrants, both legal and illegal, and a State which is a dynamic \neconomic engine for our country. I strongly believe that any \ncomprehensive immigration bill must address three issues: a \nstrengthening of our borders so that they are safe, effective, strong; \na limited guest worker program and an overhaul of the visa system; and \nmost importantly, I believe, the creation of a pathway to earned \nlegalization for the large number of people, estimated at between 10 \nand 12 million, who live today invisibly in our Nation and who have \nbecome a critical part of the American workplace and on whom employers \ndepend to do work Americans will simply not do.\n  I respond to our analysis of the Hagel-Martinez amendment, and my \nremarks are in two parts. The first part will be to propose an \nalternative to Hagel-Martinez. The second part will be a critique on \nwhat I see are substantial flaws in the Hagel-Martinez amendment.\n  I first thank both Senators Hagel and Martinez. They have done a \ngreat service to the Senate and our country by trying to come up with a \ncompromise solution to what is a major problem facing our Nation. \nNonetheless, I find significant structural and practical faults and \nhave tried to correct those with the proposal I have just introduced \nand will be speaking on now.\n  I am introducing what is called an orange card amendment. This \namendment would streamline the process for earned legalization. It \nwould create a more workable and practical program and dedicate the \nnecessary dollars to cover its costs of administration. This amendment \nbuilds on the compromises already agreed to under McCain-Kennedy and \nHagel-Martinez, and it incorporates the amendments already adopted on \nthe Senate floor. But it eliminates what I see as an unworkable three-\ntiered program under Hagel-Martinez.\n  This amendment only deals with earned legalization. It does not \nchange any of the border security provisions, the guest worker program, \nor any other part of this bill. Therefore, this amendment would \nessentially eliminate the program created by Hagel-Martinez and replace \nit with the orange card program I am now going to explain.\n  Under this amendment, all undocumented aliens who are in the United \nStates as of January 1, 2006, would immediately register a preliminary \napplication with the Department of Homeland Security. At the time of \nthe registration, they would also submit fingerprints at the U.S. \nCustoms and Immigration Service's facility so that criminal and \nnational security background checks could commence immediately. That is \nthe first step. It would also create a more precise registration system \nthat would allow the immediate inflow of information into the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to be processed electronically, which \nthe Hagel-Martinez amendment does not, and which is what we have been \ntold is essential to ensuring that DHS can handle this new workload. It \nwould give the Department time to vet the application through a \nthorough and orderly process. This would be the first step.\n  Under the second step, petitioners would submit a full application \nfor an orange card in person by providing the necessary documents to \ndemonstrate their work history and their presence in the United States. \nTheir application would also require that they pass a criminal and \nnational security background check that would be carried out based on \nthe information and fingerprints from the preapplication; they \ndemonstrate an understanding of English and U.S. history and \nGovernment, as required when someone applies for their citizenship; \nthey have paid their back taxes; and they would pay a $2,000 fine. The \nmoney from this fine would be used to cover the costs of administering \nthe program. These requirements are the second step of what is required \nto earn an orange card. They also comply with previous amendments \npassed on the floor of the Senate during this debate.\n  If the application is approved, each individual would be issued what \nI call an orange card. I selected orange because the color had no \nconnotation I could think of. This card would be encrypted with a \nmachine-readable electronic identification strip that is unique to that \nindividual. The card itself would contain biometric identifiers, anti-\ncounterfeiting security features, and an assigned number that would \nplace that individual at the end of the current line to apply for a \ngreen card. The number would correspond to the length of time that the \npetitioner has been in the United States so that those who have been \nhere the longest would be the first to follow those currently waiting \nto receive a green card. That is the 3.3 million people outside of the \ncountry awaiting a green card. These cards would go in order following \nthe expunging of that line.\n  The issuance of an orange card would allow individuals to remain in \nthe United States legally and work, as well as travel in and out of the \ncountry. It would become their fraud-proof identifier, complete with a \nphoto and fingerprints. This is the second step to earning \nlegalization.\n  The third step is that on an annual basis, each individual who \napplies for an orange card would submit to DHS documentation either \nelectronically or by mail that shows what they have been doing in that \nyear, the work they have carried out, that they have, in fact, paid \ntheir taxes that year, and\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nwhether they have been convicted of any crime during that year, either \nthrough court documents or an attestation, and they would pay a $50 \nprocessing fee. These three steps, plus the required wait at the back \nof the green card line, clearly indicates that this is not an amnesty \nprogram.\n  The legalization in the orange card must be earned, and it must be \nearned over a substantial period of time. It would be available to all \nwho are here from January of this year.\n  This language will ensure that there are enough funds to run the \nprogram because there is a $2,000 fine that would be dedicated to \npaying for the administration of the program and a $50 annual \nprocessing fee. For example, assuming there are between 10 and 20 \nmillion undocumented aliens already in the United States who would have \nto pay a $2,000 fine, if 10 million came forward, that alone would \nraise $20 billion. So the program would be covered. By including this \nlanguage, this amendment protects against creating a new burden on \ntaxpayers and ensures that the Federal Government has the necessary \nmoney to make the program work.\n  Another safeguard contained in the amendment is the annual reporting \nrequirement. By including this process, this amendment will ensure that \nindividuals who apply to this program remain productive and hard-\nworking members of their communities. The amendment requires that \nindividuals must work for at least 6 years before they may adjust their \nstatus. Realistically, from what we know about the number of green card \npetitioners legally waiting in other countries for their green card, it \nis much more likely that they would have to wait a longer time before \nthe process is completed. Again, this is not amnesty. It is a clear \npath to an earned legalization. These prospective reporting \nrequirements ensure that only individuals who deserve to adjust their \nstatus and continue to be productive members of their communities may \nbecome legal permanent residents.\n  In addition, by focusing on prospective requirements, this amendment \nstreamlines the process and helps avoid the bureaucratic morass that \nhas been created other times when Congress has acted. If we don't get \nthis right, we will end up repeating mistakes of the past. We will \nsimply create new incentives for illegal immigration, and we will \nenhance the problems our country now faces in tracking who is coming \nand going across our borders.\n  Remember, it is estimated that about one-third of those who receive \nvisas do not leave the United States when their visas expire. So the \nproblem is not only people coming across the border; the problem is \nalso people misusing their visas. In 2004, there were just over 30 \nmillion visas issued. That is an unbelievable amount, but it is true. \nThat means there could be up to 10 million people who overstayed their \nvisas and remained in the United States. Now, of course, most of them \nprobably didn't stay here permanently. But it is clear from these \nstatistics that our visa program has a serious problem when it comes to \nenforceability.\n  I strongly believe we must find an orderly way to allow those already \nhere, many of whom have families, strong community ties, and some who \nhave U.S. citizen children, to earn legalization over a substantial \nperiod of time. And virtually every poll I have seen has shown that \nover 70 percent of the American people agree. They know there are many \npeople who are critical parts of our workforce. They work in \nagriculture, in landscaping, in housing, in the service industry, in \nthe hotel industry, and they work all throughout our economy. I know \nsome who not only have children, but their children are excelling. They \nnot only live here, but they own homes, pay taxes, and they work hard. \nThis is important so that this population can live fully productive \nlives without being subject to abuse or exploitation, and so that \nAmerican commerce has the workforce that is necessary for agriculture, \nas well as many other industries.\n  During consideration of this bill in the Judiciary Committee, of \nwhich you are a distinguished member, Mr. President, we adopted an \namendment referred to as the McCain-Kennedy program that was offered by \nSenator Graham. This amendment created an earned legalization program \nthat would also set up a number of hurdles individuals must pass \nthrough in order to earn their legalization. The Graham amendment was \nadopted by a bipartisan vote of 12 to 5 and was in the base bill \npreviously considered by the Senate.\n  However, since that time, a new program was created and replaced \nMcCain-Kennedy in the underlying bill. That program is known as the \nHagel-Martinez compromise. It is important to point out that neither \nthis body nor the Judiciary Committee has voted to adopt the three-\ntiered system which the Hagel-Martinez compromise proposes and which is \nnow before this body.\n  Hagel-Martinez would treat people differently, depending on how long \nthey have been in the United States. It is estimated that 6.7 million \nhave been in the United States for more than 5 years; 1.6 million, less \nthan 2 years; and 2.8 million, 2 to 5 years. The source of the numbers \nis the Pew Current Population Survey. So we have three tiers--more than \n5 years, 2 to 5 years, and less than 2 years.\n  After an examination of the Hagel-Martinez language, I have come to \nbelieve that the three-tiered system is unworkable, that it would \ncreate a bureaucratic nightmare and it would lead to substantial fraud. \nMy staff has consulted with current and former Government staff who \nhave expressed serious concerns with the practical implications of how \nsuch a program could be implemented.\n  We already know the Department of Homeland Security is overburdened. \nJust for a moment, look at the problems they face today. Our current \nsystem is running neither efficiently nor effectively, and we all know \nthat. Let me just put on the table a few examples.\n  Currently, the Department of Homeland Security is struggling to \nimplement a fully functioning US-VISIT Program to monitor those who are \nentering and exiting our country. This system of checking people in and \nout with a biometric card is only half completed. It is many years \noverdue.\n  The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services struggles with \nenormous backlogs in applications from those who come to this country \nand attempt to adjust their status legally. FBI background checks often \ntake between 1 or 2 years to process fingerprints. Naturalization lines \nare so long, it can take a person years and sometimes even decades to \nget through the system. How on Earth is DHS going to be able to handle \na new program which cannot be run electronically and which will require \nmassive documentation and enormous staff time?\n  What we have done is provided a structure for an electronic handling \nof the data submitted by the individuals, the electronic verification \nof the data, the checking out of this data. Hagel-Martinez creates a \ntiered system where those here less than 2 years are subject to \ndeportation and those here from 2 to 5 years must return to their \ncountry and get themselves somehow into a guest worker program. It is \nestimated that 1.6 million people have been here for 2 years or less, \nand approximately 2.8 million have been here from 2 to 5 years. So that \nis 4.4 million people who are going to be asked to leave the country \none way or another. Do you believe they will? History and reality shows \nthat they will not. How will the Government find all of them and deport \nthose who do not leave voluntarily? And if they are found and deported, \nwhat would lead us to believe they will not come right back to join \ntheir families and return to their jobs?\n  Secondly, individuals who have been here just under 2 or 5 years will \ninevitably try to argue they qualify for a higher tier. I think it is \nonly realistic to expect that these tiers will become a breeding ground \nfor flawed, fraudulent documents, and true evaluations will be \nvirtually impossible to make. How on Earth are DHS personnel going to \nbe able to verify when an individual entered the country to determine \nthe less than 2 years or the 2- to 5-year tier?\n\n  When it comes to the second tier, 2 to 5 years, and the deferred \nmandatory departure program of Hagel-Martinez, I am concerned about how \nthis process is going to function and who is going to follow through \nwith executing its requirements. How is the Department of Homeland \nSecurity going to find these people who have been here 2 to 5 years and \nensure that they actually leave the United States? Does anyone really \nexpect that a father or a mother will voluntarily leave their families \nand go\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\noutside the country for this so-called touchback? What is the incentive \nfor people who have already been living in the United States to come \nforward and go through this process?\n  In order to understand why I have these questions, I think it is \nimportant for everyone to understand how the deferred mandatory \ndeparture program of Hagel-Martinez is supposed to work. There has been \na lot of discussion about the program, but when you read the fine print \nof the bill language, there are serious questions and consequences that \nneed to be better understood.\n  My understanding of the bill language is that a person who falls into \nthis second tier, who has been here for 2 to 5 years, may remain in the \nUnited States legally for up to 3 years and then they must leave the \ncountry and find a legal program through which they may reenter the \nUnited States. This is the critical flaw in Hagel-Martinez. People will \nnot risk leaving their families or their jobs in the hopes that once \nthey leave the United States they will be able to reenter through a \nvisa program, whether that be the new H-2C guest worker program or \nanother visa program.\n  To compound this problem but ostensibly to make it possible, Hagel-\nMartinez waives the 200,000 visa cap that we just reduced from 325,000 \nin the Bingaman-Feinstein amendment on the H-2C program. In doing that, \nthis would create a larger bureaucratic hurdle, a difficult standard of \nproof, and a complete decimation of the limits on the guest worker \nprogram. Instead of a new guest worker program--H-2C--that will bring \nin 200,000 people a year, we would be, in effect, creating a guest \nworker program that is supposed to accommodate 2.8 million people, plus \nanother 200,000 people annually. So through this deferred mandatory \ndeparture, the Congress creates a guest worker program that will need \nto accommodate over 3 million people.\n  But putting all that aside, assuming this was actually doable, there \nare other problems. For instance, the H-2C guest worker visa only lasts \na maximum of 6 years. So every person will quickly see that this is not \nan automatic path to earn their legalization, and they will be forced \nout of the country at the end of the 6 years. Will they go? I doubt it. \nI think you will have a new illegal immigrant problem.\n  The path to legalization has been modified through the amendment \nprocess on this floor, and now an H-2C worker will likely need their \nemployer to petition for a green card on their behalf. An employer has \nto petition for it, meaning that, for 2 million people, their only hope \nto continue to live in the United States is through the grace of an \nemployer. I think this places an undue burden on an employer, and it \nleaves workers vulnerable to exploitation from bad employers.\n  Also, H-2C workers, their spouses, and their children are not allowed \nto remain in the United States if the worker fails to work for an \napproved employer for more than 60 consecutive at any time during the 6 \nyears, with no exception for health problems or injuries. This will \nmean that if an individual does become injured or ill, they become \ndeportable. In addition, all rights to administrative or judicial \nreview of any future removal actions, are eliminated. Combined, in my \nview, these provisions are ill-advised. They make individuals extremely \nvulnerable to abuse, they put high burdens on employers, and they open \nthe situation up to exploitation.\n  That leaves me to wonder, with these shortcomings, why would anyone \nin these categories participate in this program?\n  Why would someone who is already living here clandestinely, working, \nand already active in their community voluntarily come forward and \nregister with the Department of Homeland Security and leave the United \nStates to join this program? With these risks and pitfalls, my \nexperience in California and my 13\\1/2\\ years on the Immigration \nSubcommittee tells me they won't. At worst, I fear we are creating an \nincentive for individuals to continue living under an illegal status, \nand I don't know how that benefits this Nation, the people of our \nNation, the employers, or the people who are here today in an \nundocumented status. At best, we are creating a new burden on DHS to \nlocate and monitor millions of people who are clandestinely integrated \ninto the fabric of our Nation today.\n  In addition, the Hispanic National Bar Association specifically \ncriticized this second tier, and it wrote this: We are particularly \nconcerned that requiring individuals in the [second tier] to leave this \ncountry in order to fully legalize their status will result in severe \ndisruptions for families, workers, and employers . . . We [also] \nbelieve that creating an additional class of undocumented immigrants \nwill lead to greater administrative burdens as it will require the \nimplementation of two different paths to legalization.\n  I think that is a very true statement.\n  Let me speak about the third tier for those who have been here for \nless than 2 years because according to Hagel-Martinez, they must all be \ndeported. This means that DHS would be required to find and deport 2 \nmillion people. That is the bill we are going to pass--2 million, find \nthem, deport them. How is that going to get done? Even President Bush \nacknowledged that such a large-scale deportation program is unworkable \nwhen he said this:\n\n       It is neither wise nor realistic to round up millions of \n     people and send them across the border.\n\n  The only method to compel compliance with Hagel-Martinez is through \nemployer sanctions, and we know from experience over dozens of years \nthat employer sanctions do not work.\n  In fiscal year 2004, only 46 employers were convicted of illegal \nimmigrant employment--46 employers--out of the tens of thousands of \nemployers whom we know employ the undocumented, and the number of \nemployer sanctions cases resulting in fines has declined from a peak of \nnearly 900 under President Clinton to only 124 in fiscal year 2003. Not \nto mention even when employers are raided and then sanctioned, there is \na backlash from the public.\n  So I am one who doesn't believe it is realistic to assume that, \nfirst, the Department of Homeland Security is going to be able to go \nout and deport 2 million people; and then secondly, to ensure that the \nother 2.8 million leave to go back for the touchback program.\n  So because of these concerns about the workability, the practicality, \nand the real-world impact of such a three-tiered system, I believe we \nhave to create a much more efficient process, and I believe the orange \ncard process is the best way to ensure that our policy goals in \ncreating a path to legalization can be implemented and realized.\n  The structural flaws of Hagel-Martinez must be corrected, and this \namendment essentially corrects them. It is workable, it is practical, \nit does not reward illegal immigration, but it creates a pathway for \neveryone in this country as of the beginning of this year to show over \na substantial period of time annually that they have been and will \ncontinue to be a responsible and productive member of American society. \nIt puts the burden on them to go in, to petition, to submit their \nfingerprints, to submit their photographs, and to wait for those to be \nchecked out before they would be issued the orange card.\n  Once you have this orange card then you know you are legal. You can \ncome in and out. It has the biometric identifiers. It is fraudproof. \nAnd the orange card has the additional ability of being numbered, so \nyou also know that the lower numbers are going to people who have been \nhere for the 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 years that we know people, in fact, \nhave been in this country. It is done in a way that can be carried out \nelectronically, and I think that is part of the strength of the \nprogram.\n  Here we have a pathway that requires an individual to show over a \nsubstantial period of time that they have been and will continue to be \na responsible and productive member of American society and to do so \nwith certain tangible deeds: the tangible deed of work, the tangible \ndeed of living a legal life, the tangible deed of paying back taxes, \nthe tangible deed of learning to speak English. This is not amnesty. \nNothing happens immediately. Amnesty is the immediate transition of \nsomeone from an illegal status to a legal status. If an individual \ncannot demonstrate these things, they will not receive a green card at \nthe end of this long pathway, and then at that time they are \ndeportable.\n  If a bipartisan majority agrees that an earned legalization program \nis a critical part of a comprehensive immigration reform bill, then the \nprogram\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\nmust work on the streets and it must be carefully structured so that it \ncan be carried out. I believe this program can be carried out, and I am \nsorry to say that as currently structured, I do not believe the three-\ntiered process of Hagel-Martinez can or will be carried out.\n  This is an amendment on which I hope we will vote. It is at the desk. \nI ask my colleagues to look at it, study it, and if they have \nmodifications--this is a complicated issue--if they have modifications \nthey would like to see, please bring these to us because we hope there \nwill be a vote in the next couple of days.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. McCONNELL are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have been a Member of the Senate, now \nin my 26th year, and one of the issues that I have some regret about is \nvoting for amnesty in the 1986 immigration bill, the last time that we \nhad amnesty for people who illegally came to our country.\n  Another regret I have that has followed on is that probably we have \nnot done enough to keep on top of our laws of anticipating when there \nwas labor or workers needed from outside the country to come into our \ncountry, and we haven't provided then maybe the workers that we need \nwhen there aren't enough Americans to fill various jobs. That could be \nlaborers in the case of construction, it could be service workers in \nthe case of hotels, it could be engineers, if we don't educate enough \nengineers. And probably those two regrets I have relate to how I feel \nabout the present legislation before the Senate.\n  I have looked back at my vote for amnesty, and I have tried to recall \nas best I can 20 years back. But it seems to me that I was convinced at \nthat time that if we had amnesty along with worker verification, along \nwith sanctions against workers, which I think was set in the law with a \n$10,000 fine, we would solve all of our illegal immigration problems.\n  Well, at that particular time, we did not predict and foresee the \ndevelopment of an industry of fraudulent documentmaking, so that if I \ncame to this country illegally and I went in to get a job and I showed \na passport that looked like the real thing but was fraudulent, and the \nemployer didn't see the difference and they hired me, then he was \nabsolved of any responsibility for willfully hiring a person illegally \nin this country. And amnesty was supposed to work with that to legalize \n1 million people who were illegally in the country at that particular \ntime.\n  So looking back now 20 years, it seems as though we winked at abuse \nof the law, and it gives credibility to people who think they can avoid \nthe law because there is never going to be a penalty for it. So what \nwas a 1 million-person problem in 1986, today the number is up to a 12 \nmillion-person problem, people coming into this country illegally.\n  So I have some apologies to the people of this country because I made \na judgment that amnesty in 1986 would solve our problems, and ignoring \nillegality, I find, has encouraged further illegality, and we have 12 \nmillion people now in the country illegally.\n  Then I wonder whether, now that I am 72 years old, 20 years down the \nroad when my successor is in office will they be dealing with an \nillegal alien problem of 25 million. Another thing I learned from 1986 \nwas that we allowed family members of people who were here illegally to \nthen come to the head of the line, and instead of legalizing 1 million \npeople, we probably made it possible for 3 million people to be in this \ncountry as opposed to waiting to come in under the normal process. \nThen, the other part of it, to repeat, is maybe if we had been a little \nmore on top of the employment situation in the United States in recent \nyears, we would have changed our laws so that more people could come \nlegally to this country to work. Having learned from those lessons--\nobviously I have been burned once on the issue of amnesty--I am not \nsure I want to be burned twice on the issue of amnesty.\n\n  Of course, at this point, with 1 more week to go in the debate on \nthis bill and many amendments, I don't know, there might be a bill I \ncan vote for. But I don't think I am prepared to vote for amnesty \nagain. I am not prepared to vote for amnesty again and then create a \nproblem 20 years down the road for our successors to have yet a bigger \nproblem.\n  I think we have learned in America that we are a nation of the rule \nof law and that we ought to enforce the law. I think we made a mistake \nby ignoring illegality in 1986 because it encouraged further \nillegality. It is a little bit like getting crime under control in New \nYork City. When Mayor Giuliani first came into office, he decided that \nthe way to get at big crime was not to allow the petty crime. He went \nto work concentrating on people who were abusing the law even in a \nminimal sense. Soon it made an impact that he was going to be tough on \ncrime, and pretty soon you found a great reduction in major crime. If \nwe start enforcing our immigration laws and if at the same time we have \na realistic law for people to legally come to this country, then maybe \nwe will be able to get the sovereignty of our Nation to what it is \nsupposed to be, and that is at least the controlling of our borders.\n  One of the things I wish to make clear is that there is a guest \nworker program used in place of amnesty. I understood previous speakers \nto say you can earn your way to legality, you can earn your way to \ncitizenship. There are a lot of people who commit crimes who never get \na chance to work their way out of that crime. It probably signals to \npeople in other lands a softness of our concern about whether people \ncome here obeying our laws and sends a signal that it is OK to \ndisregard our laws. So a guest worker program that is used to cover up \namnesty I can't buy into.\n  There are proposals connected with this bill to allow people to come \nhere legally to work, to have a job and to have papers when they cross \nthe border to come into our country to work. We are expanding some of \nthose provisions for people to legally come to this country, and we are \ninviting people to come in as guest workers.\n  My belief is people would rather come to work legally than illegally. \nIf we had a temporary worker program that was not a bureaucratic \nnightmare and people who wanted to work in America and had a job in \nAmerica knew they could come here legally, they would choose the legal \nway to come as opposed to the illegal way to come. I believe if we had \nsuch a program that worked and was efficient and people could count on \nit, including employers counting on it, then pretty soon, one by one, \nwe would have legal workers replacing illegal workers because surely \nemployers would rather hire people who came here legally.\n  If we are going to have an amnesty program, it ought to be one about \nwhich people can at least say that it meets the commonsense test, that \nit is not a joke, that it is a real, serious effort to make people earn \ntheir way to citizenship. I want to point out some things in the \npresent bill before the Senate that do not meet the laugh test, as far \nas amnesty is concerned.\n  The biggest flaw is providing legal status to 12 million people who \nare breaking our law by coming here illegally. Not only do we give \namnesty to those who are here, but we give it to spouses and children \nin their home countries. In 1986, I voted for amnesty. I was burned \nonce. I don't want to be burned twice. With a 1 million-people problem \nat that time, we actually ended up maybe with 3 million people coming \nhere under the laws we passed at that time, particularly considering \nfamily. If it is 12 million people we are talking about now, and 3 \ntimes that, are we talking about 36 million people as opposed to 12 \nmillion people? Amnesty is giving a free ride to 12 million\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\npeople, and maybe 36 million people if you consider 3 for 1. That was \nthe lesson we learned in 1986.\n  Let's look at the so-called earned legalization provisions. \nProponents of the bill say that an alien has to pay their taxes, pay a \nfine, learn English, and get in the back of the line--the line leading \nto legalization, the line that eventually could lead to citizenship.\n  I respectfully disagree with my colleagues who say that they are \nearning their citizenship. I will go into detail about each of these \nprovisions, starting with the $2,000 fine. An illegal alien can go from \nillegal to legal just by paying a fine of $2,000. That is chump change, \nparticularly considering that the same people could have paid a \nsmuggler five times that amount to get across the border in the first \nplace. This is not a heavy fine for the law that they broke. People \nhere illegally knowingly crossed our border and overstayed their visa \neach day. They get legal status overnight for a small price; $2,000 is \na small price to pay for citizenship, especially since they have been \nworking in the country and making a living for over 5 years. This fine \nis nothing but a slap on the hand, and it doesn't fit the illegality \ninvolved.\n\n  The fine of $2,000 isn't due right away. In other words, you don't \nhave to pay it right away. For those in the amnesty program, what is \ncalled the first-tier program, aliens here illegally are supposed to \npay a fine of $2,000. However, the way the bill is written, many aliens \nhere illegally may not have to pay that fine until year 8, 8 years from \nthat point. The bill says that the $2,000 fine has to be paid, in the \nwords of the legislation, ``prior to adjudication.'' What does that \nmean? The fine is not going to be required up front. If it is left the \nway it is, then the alien here illegally can live, work, and play in \nour country and is immune from deportation, all without paying any fine \nfor maybe up to 8 years and all the time imposing a financial burden on \nlocal taxpayers for health, education, and infrastructure costs that \nare not reimbursed for 5 to 10 years.\n  Let's look at the requirement about learning English and civics. \nUnder the bill, an illegal alien could fulfill the requirement of \nlearning English history and U.S. Government by ``pursuing a course of \nstudy.'' Until Senator Inhofe's amendment last week, the alien didn't \nhave to show their understanding of English or civics, yet the authors \nof this legislation wanted us to believe that in order to get this \nlegal status, you had to show proficiency in English and understand how \nour political system works. The Inhofe amendment took care of that, but \nit was certainly a low bar for people illegally in our country to meet.\n  On the issue of paying taxes: Under the bill, aliens illegally in our \ncountry only have to pay 3 of the last years in back taxes. Let me ask \nany taxpayer, wouldn't you like to have the choice of only paying taxes \non 3 out of any 5 years? But that is supposed to be a step toward \nearning your way to citizenship. Why, if any of us did that and fraud \nwas involved, we would be in jail. At the very least, you would have to \npay all your taxes for all those years and pay fines and penalties. \nBut, no, people illegally in our country get an option. You don't get \nan option; my constituents don't get an option, what years they want to \npay back taxes. We have a tax gap of $345 billion in this country, \ntaxes that the IRS is owed but that are not collected. Of course, this \nmakes the problem even worse. This bill would treat tax law breakers \nbetter than the American people. Let's make the alien who is here \nillegally, who gets amnesty, pay all outstanding tax liabilities. That \nis the only way this bill--or at least the portion of this bill we call \namnesty--can meet the commonsense test.\n  On the issue of payment of taxes and the burden that might cause for \nthe IRS, that is another portion of this bill that doesn't meet the \ncommonsense test. Under the bill, the Internal Revenue Service has to \nprove that an alien here illegally has paid their back taxes. Frankly, \nit will be impossible for the Internal Revenue Service to truly enforce \nthis because the Agency cannot audit every single person in the \ncountry.\n  I am chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. We have jurisdiction \nover the Internal Revenue Service. I can tell you that the tax man is \ngoing to have a difficult time verifying whether an individual owes any \ntaxes. Why aren't we putting the burden on the aliens? They need to go \nback and they need to figure out what they owe. That is what each one \nof us does every spring between January and April 15, before we file \nour taxes. We figure out how much we owe, and we have to pay what we \nowe. Then in turn let who is here illegally certify to the Internal \nRevenue Service that they have paid their dues.\n  I have an amendment to fix this language and allow the IRS to devise \na system to make that work. But the end result for this chairman of the \nFinance Committee is that these people who are here illegally should \nnot have a better tax posture toward the IRS than any other hard-\nworking American man and woman.\n  Now I want to go to security clearances to be given in 90 days, \nanother part of this bill that doesn't meet the commonsense test. The \ncompromise would require the Department of Homeland Security to do a \nbackground check on aliens who are here illegally. In fact, this \ncompromise has placed a time limit on our Federal agents. The bill \nencourages the Federal Government to complete the background checks on \n10 million aliens who are here illegally within 90 days. Can you \nimagine that?\n  Can you imagine taking care of background checks on 10 million people \nin 90 days? That doesn't meet the commonsense test. It is unrealistic. \nIt is not only unrealistic, it is impossible, and a huge burden, as you \ncan see, and a huge expense. Homeland Security will surely try to hurry \nwith those background checks. They will pressure Congress to rush them. \nThere will be a lot of rubberstamping of applications despite possible \ngang participation, criminal activity, terrorist ties, or other \nviolations of our laws.\n  I am not talking about the vast majority of people who are working in \nAmerica and here illegally. I am talking about a small percentage of \nthese people. But with that small percentage, we ought to be sure our \nnational security concerns are taken care of, and, no, we should not be \nrushing these clearances through in 90 days.\n  When it comes to criminal activity, terrorist ties, other violations \nof the law, and gang participation, that is not true. I will bet that \n99 percent of the people who are here illegally, who are working hard \nto improve their lot in life but still here illegally, violating our \nlaws, want a better life. But a small group of them, we have to know \nthat they are not a national security risk. And you can't do that in 90 \ndays with 10 million people.\n  Let's talk about during the amnesty process and people having to go \nto the back of the line to work their way toward citizenship. The \nproponents say the aliens who are illegal would have to go to the back \nof the line so they are not getting ahead of those who use our legal \nchannels. That whole approach, if you are going to have amnesty, is the \nway to do it. This doesn't meet the commonsense test, but someone has \nto explain to me actually how it works.\n  This is important because at my town meetings--I had 19 town meetings \nin Iowa during the Easter break--some of the most vociferous statements \nagainst amnesty were made by naturalized citizens who said: How come I \nhad to go through all these things and stand in line for long periods \nof time to become a citizen or even be legally in this country and you \nare going to move all of these other people to the head of the line?\n  The theory is that they are going to take care of that criticism in \nthis bill, but it isn't very practical. How is the Citizenship and \nImmigration Service going to keep track of these people? They can't \neven count right because they give out more visas than the law \nrequires. Besides, an alien on an amnesty track is getting the benefits \nthat people in their home countries waiting in line to come here \nlegally can't get. This whole process denigrates the value of legal \nimmigration.\n  While here, they get to travel, send their kids to school, open a \nbusiness, and get health services. Is that really going to the back of \nthe line?\n  The work requirements also don't meet the commonsense test. The bill \nsays that an illegal alien has to prove that they have worked in the \nUnited States for 3 of the last 5 years. It also\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\nsays they have to work for 6 years after the date of enactment. \nHowever, there is no continuous work requirement through amnesty. So \nyou could work 30 days on, 30 days off, 30 days on. It is dishonest to \nsay these people are working the entire time.\n  Let's get to the evidence of that work history which the bill \nrequires. It says a person illegally in the United States has to prove \nthey have worked in the United States 3 of the last 5 years. How do you \ndo that? They can show the IRS or Social Security Administration \nrecords or records maintained by Federal, State, and local governments. \nTheir employer can attest that they have been working; their labor \nunion or day labor center can attest, but that is not all. It might \nmeet the commonsense test. But if you can't get records from the IRS or \nthe labor union, you can ask anybody to attest that you have been \nemployed. The bill doesn't even prohibit the alien to attest \nthemselves. Anybody, including a friend, a neighbor, a man on the \nstreet, could sign the attestation.\n  This opens the door to fraud. The Government cannot realistically \ninvestigate them. Senator Vitter tightened this loophole, but sworn \naffidavits still exist. This is an issue of confidentiality in \nreporting. If an alien illegally in the country is applying for \namnesty, the Federal Government cannot use information provided in the \napplication by adjudication; that is, adjudicating that petition. If \naliens illegally in the country write in their application that they \nare related to, let's say, Bin Laden, then our Government cannot use \nthat information. In fact, it says that the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity can only share that information if someone requests it in \nwriting.\n  Why shouldn't the Secretary be required to provide that information \nto the CIA? If we can link an alien to a drug trafficking kingpin, then \nwhy shouldn't the application be a source of intelligence?\n  This provision severely handicaps our national security and criminal \ninvestigators, and again a provision in this bill that doesn't meet the \ncommonsense test.\n  Let's look at the so-called $10,000 fine for bureaucrats. Let's say a \nFederal agent uses the information I just spoke about by an alien in an \napplication for amnesty. Under the bill, the agent would be fined \n$10,000. Yes, fined five times more than the alien has to pay to get \namnesty in the first place. That does not pass the commonsense test.\n  Let's look at qualifying for Social Security for aliens who are here \nillegally. The bill does not prohibit illegal aliens from getting \ncredit for the money they put into the Social Security system if they \nworked in the United States illegally. Immigrants here illegally who \npaid Social Security taxes using a stolen Social Security number did \nnot do so with the expectation that they would ever qualify for Social \nSecurity benefits. They paid those taxes solely as a cost of doing \ntheir job. They never paid into the system with a reasonable \nexpectation that they would receive any benefits. People who have \nbroken the law should not be able to collect benefits based upon \nunlawful conduct. Their conduct has caused damage to countless numbers \nof American citizens and legal immigrants. Because of breaking our law, \nthe victims are faced with Internal Revenue audits for unpaid taxes. \nAmericans have trouble finding their own jobs and are left to reclaim \nthe credit and clear up their personnel information. The Enzi amendment \nwould have taken care of this, but it did not pass.\n  Our Members, again, gave up an opportunity of having this legislation \nmeet another commonsense test. Employers get a criminal pardon for \nhiring illegal aliens under this bill. Not only does this bill legalize \npeople who are here. illegally, it is going to pardon employers who \ncommitted criminal activity in hiring illegal aliens in the first \nplace.\n\n  The bill says employers of aliens applying for adjustment status \n``shall not be subject to civil or criminal tax liability relating \ndirectly to the employment of such aliens.''\n  That means a business that hired illegal workers now gets off Scott-\nfree from paying the taxes they should have paid. This encourages \nemployers to violate our tax laws and not pay what they owe the Federal \nGovernment. Why should they get off the hook?\n  What damage are we doing, once again as we did in 1986, in ignoring \nthe breaking of law, giving amnesty and encouraging further disregard \nfor the law in the future?\n  In addition to not having to pay their taxes, employers are also off \nthe hook for providing illegal aliens with records or evidence that \nthey have worked in the United States. The employers are not subject to \ncivil or criminal liability for having employed illegal aliens in the \npast or before enactment.\n  Then fines for failing to depart, for aliens illegally in this \ncountry--those in what the bill calls the second tier who have been \nhere for a period of time, from 2 years to 5 years, they must depart \nand reenter. If an alien doesn't depart immediately, they face a fine \nof $2,000. If they don't leave within 3 years, they get a $3,000 fine. \nThese fines are not incentives for aliens to leave. They could then \nlive in the United States for up to 3 years without facing deportation. \nThere is no requirement for them to leave immediately.\n  Take a look at that subtlety in this legislation. If you want to be \nsatisfied with paying a $3,000 fine, you can stay here an additional 3 \nyears illegally, and we presumably know that you are here illegally.\n  The second-tier employment requirements--these illegal aliens also \nhave to prove that they have been working in the United States since \nJanuary 7, 2004. They can prove it by attesting to the Federal \nGovernment or an employer, not necessarily the one that employed them. \nThey can also get around the requirement by providing bank records, \nbusiness records, sworn affidavits, or remittance records.\n  Since when does proof of sending money back to Mexico prove \nemployment? That, too, doesn't meet the commonsense test and is another \ncase where the legislation talks about mandatory departure. It really \nis not mandatory.\n  The bill says the Secretary of Homeland Security may grant deferred \nmandatory departure for aliens here illegally in the 2- to 5-year \ncategory. He may, the law says, also waive the departure requirement if \nit would create a substantial hardship for the alien to leave.\n  In this legislation, there is a waiver interview requirement. Illegal \naliens in the second tier who are required to leave the country can \nreenter the United States on a visa, but the bill says they do not have \nto be interviewed. In fact, it doesn't even give discretion to our \nconsular officers around the world to require an interview.\n  I have advocated for in-person interviews since 9/11, especially \nsince the hijackers weren't subject to appear in person. Today, the \nState Department is requiring interviews for most applicants and waives \nthem for certain people, particularly those over 60 years of age. If an \nadjudicator wants to have an interview before giving a person a visa, \nthey should have the power to do it.\n\n  Guest workers, under the provisions of this compromise, can become \npermanent workers. Unlike almost all visas, the H-2C visa can be used \nas an avenue to legal permanent residence and citizenship. The H-2C \nvisa was created as a temporary worker program. In fact, the alien, at \nthe time of application, has to prove they did not plan to abandon \ntheir residence in the foreign country. However, the visa can be \nredeemed for legal permanent residence after only 1 year in the United \nStates.\n  H-2C workers can self-petition under this compromise. No other visa \nprogram allows an alien to petition for himself or herself to go from \ntemporary worker to seeking citizenship. After 4 years, the alien can \nsponsor themselves for permanent residence in the United States. We had \nan amendment to tighten this provision, but the self-petition measure \nis still in the bill.\n  Family members of H-2C visa holders need not be healthy. Under \ncurrent law, aliens must prove they are admissible and meet certain \nhealth standards. Many times, visa applicants must have a medical exam \nto show they do not have communicable diseases. They have to be up to \ndate on immunizations and cannot have mental disorders. Spouses and \nchildren of H-2C visa holders, however, are exempt from this \nrequirement. I have an amendment to fix this provision.\n  The H-1B visa cap can increase automatically. The annual cap is \nincreased from 65,000 to 115,000, but it contains an\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\nadditional built-in escalator. If the cap is reached in 1 year, it can \nbe increased by 20 percent the next year. It cannot be decreased; it \ncan only go up.\n  There will be no serious evaluation of the need for foreign workers, \nand Congress loses its control over importation of cheaper labor.\n  There are no strings attached in this bill to new student visas. The \nbill creates a new visa that lowers the bar for foreign students who \nwish to come here and study math, science, and engineering. They can \nwork off campus while in school, thus taking American jobs. They also \ncan easily adjust from a student to a U.S. worker. They do not have to \nprove they will return to their home country when applying for the \nvisa. Why would a student come here to study anything if they could be \napproved instantly without the requirement of the old visa system? Have \nsome people forgotten that the September 11 terrorists came on student \nvisas?\n  Now the US-VISIT provision. Congress mandated in 1996 the entry-exit \nsystem known to us under the acronym of US-VISIT. This program was \nauthorized 10 years ago. It is still not up and running.\n  The bill says Homeland Security has to give Congress a schedule for \nequipping all land border ports of entry and making the system \ninteroperable with other screening systems. Why, oh why, aren't they \ngetting this job done? Why does Congress give the agency more time to \nget this system running? It does not make sense for us to ask for \nanother timeline; it seems sensible just to get it done.\n  In the final analysis, I am probably only 1 of 15 Senators still in \nthis Senate since the 1986 immigration law was passed, but I was led to \nbelieve in 1986 that by voting for amnesty with employer sanctions, we \nwould solve our illegal immigration problem. It just encouraged further \nillegal immigration. I quantify that by saying it was a 1 million-\nperson program in 1986. Today, it is a 12 million-person problem. And \n20 years from now, if we do not do it right this time, it is going to \nbe a 25 million-person problem. You get burned once, but you should not \nget burned twice or you have not learned anything. In the process, we \nought to get it right this time. I don't think granting amnesty 20 \nyears after we made the first mistake is the way to do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the \nleadership of Senator Grassley. He spoke from the heart. He was here \nduring the 1986 amnesty debate. I happened to go back and I saw a \nsummary of that debate. The Members argued on one side saying it was a \none-time amnesty; others said amnesty begets amnesty, that if this \noccurs, there will be more to come. In truth, we see which side has \nprevailed.\n  Chairman Grassley has given much insight and wisdom. I hope our \nMembers will consider what he has to say. It is thoughtful, honest, and \ndirect, as always.\n  I do remain troubled that the Senate is moving steadily, like a train \ndown the tracks, to pass an immigration bill that is deeply flawed. It \ndramatically increases legal immigration and has no guarantee that \nsignificantly improved enforcement procedures will ever be carried out. \nIn fact, the Senate rejected the Isakson amendment which would have \nconditioned amnesty on effective enforcement. Clearly, we have not \ncomprehended the ramifications of rewarding those who have broken our \nlaws with all the benefits we give to those who lawfully enter, thereby \nundermining, as Senator Grassley said, the rule of law in this country.\n  Further, this legislation, which claims to be comprehensive, provides \na radical increase in future legal immigration almost with no \ndiscussion or consideration of what is good policy for our future. In \naddition, the legislation has been crafted in a way that hides and \nconceals, even misrepresents, its real effects.\n  Thus, I have said it should never pass. I have said that these \nactions are unworthy of the great Senate of the United States. I have \nsaid, and I think correctly, we should be ashamed of ourselves.\n  What should we be doing? What should the Senate of the United States \nbe doing? We should be working openly and diligently on these issues \nand should have been for some time. We should be seeking the input of \nexperts and carefully studying relevant data. Certainly we should be \nconsulting with those who have hired us--at least for a term--the \nAmerican people.\n  In my view, the American people have been right from the beginning. \nThey have rejected an immigration system that makes a mockery of law, a \nsystem that rewards illegal behavior, while placing unnecessary \nbureaucratic hurdles in the face of those who dutifully attempt to \ncomply with the law. In the decades before the 1986 amnesty and after, \nthey have urged and pleaded with the powers that be to end the \nillegality, to secure the border, and to develop a system based on the \ncommonsense interests of our Nation. The American people have been \narrogantly ignored by the executive branch and by the Congress.\n  We have failed to fulfill our responsibilities, in direct opposition \nto the legitimate and clearly stated will of the American people.\n  In every way, the American people have been correct. They have been \nmotivated by the highest of American ideals, despite what the critics \nsay. They have sought a lawful, wise system of immigration. It is \nunfair to ascribe to the good American people the words of some \nfrustrated and extreme person whose anger overflows--the talk show \ncallers and the like. That is not the heart of the American people, \njust because someone mis-spoke on a talk show or in a conversation. \nWhat they are saying is legitimate, principled, and consistent with the \nAmerican ideals. We have not responded to it. We did not respond to it \nbefore 1986. We did not respond to it in 1986. We have not responded to \nit since.\n  The American people will support a fair and generous immigration \npolicy for the future, and they will support compassionate and fair \ntreatment of people who have come here illegally. They are not asking \nthat they be prosecuted, locked up, or that every one be hauled out of \nAmerica. That is not so. No one is proposing that in any serious way.\n  Make no mistake, we cannot treat lightly and it is a grave step to \nconcede, to admit, that the laws of the United States will be ignored \nand not enforced. During the 1986 amnesty debate, it was argued that \namnesty would be a one-time event. People argued that if that were \ndone, it would weaken the rule of law and encourage more people to \nenter the country illegally, confident that at some day in the future, \namnesty would be available to them, too. I ask my colleagues, who was \nright 20 years ago?\n  Senator Grassley just told us who was right. He said he believed it \nwas a mistake when he voted for it. Not many Senators have the gumption \nto come to the Senate and admit they made a mistake. While amnesty just \n20 years ago created a legal route to citizenship for 3 million people \nnot here legally, today we are expecting, 20 years later, 11 million \nand perhaps 20 million people could benefit from this amnesty.\n  We must acknowledge that when you play around with the rule of law in \na nation that expects to be treated seriously, you have done something \nquite significant. It cannot be altered or undermined without real \nconsequences. Life has consequences. If you pass a law and then turn \naround and admit you cannot enforce it, with a promise that we are \ngoing to enforce it in the future and we are going to allow everyone \nwho violated a law a free pass, what does that say about the future? \nThese are not light matters. If we could do it like that, if we could \nmake this kind of 180-degree turn without consequences, it would be one \nthing, but life is not that way. We are supposed to be a mature branch \nof Government of the greatest Nation on the face of the Earth. Surely \nwe know that. Surely we know we cannot do this lightly. I am afraid \nsome have not given enough thought to that.\n  I wanted to share those remarks at the beginning because we are \ndealing with huge numbers of people who will be legalized. We will be \ndealing with a fundamental expansion of immigration, a massive amnesty, \nlarge increases in governmental expenditures, and an enforcement \npromise I am not sure we will ever see occur because enforcement was \npromised in 1986. It was\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nfaithfully and honestly guaranteed by supporters of that bill in 1986, \nand it was never accomplished.\n  I will introduce four amendments this afternoon. The four amendments \nare, first, a numerical limit amendment, an amendment to cap the \nimmigration increases caused by this bill. The numbers CBO and the \nWhite House say we should expect include 7 million and their dependents \nunder amnesty. Additionally, CBO and the White House estimate that \nunder this bill 8 million new immigrants will flow into the country \nabove the current level 10 million over the next 10 years. Got that? \nWhat my amendment will do is cap green cards at 7 million for amnesty, \nplus we are going to add 8 million to the current flow in the future.\n  We think the numbers are higher than that. But that is what the CBO \nsays the numbers are. That is what the White House has trumpeted as the \nnumbers. So at least, I suggest, this Senate should make clear those \nare the numbers, and let's pass it, so we will not have this danger \nthat the bill will spin out of control or in fact will be much more \ngenerous to immigration than some are currently suggesting, even CBO.\n  Another amendment will be the earned-income tax credit. This would be \nan amendment to eliminate the earned-income tax credit for illegal \naliens and those who have adjusted status under this bill. Once illegal \naliens become citizens, they will once again be eligible for the \nearned-income tax credit. But it is a huge expense, maybe over $20 \nbillion over 20 years.\n  I will have an amendment to deal with chain migration which has to do \nwith provisions that are continued in current law but are not \nprincipled and do not serve our Nation well. If we want to admit more \nskill-based immigrants, we must reduce the right of immigrants to bring \nin certain categories of relatives, regardless of skill, regardless of \nability to perform.\n  We will work on those four amendments, and I hope we will be able to \nget a vote on them. I know people are saying: No, no, we need to move \nthis bill on. We can't go another day. We have to finish this debate. \nYou guys have had your little amendments. The train is moving. Get off \nthe track. We are going forward. And I am already hearing that we are \nmoving in that direction: The debate is going to be limited, and we \nwill have to curtail our legitimate amendments.\n  I submit to you, the amendments I am offering here are legitimate \namendments that go to real issues of national importance, not some \ntechnical thing.\n  My amendment that deals with the total number of immigrants into the \nUnited States comports with the estimates of the Congressional Budget \nOffice which has run these numbers. I thought they were low, but that \nis what they say, and the White House has jumped right on it and said: \nThese are the numbers, and Sessions and the Heritage Foundation are all \nwrong. Their numbers are not good. These are good numbers, so let's \njust have a vote on it and let's make it law.\n  They estimate that a total of 7 million illegal aliens and their \ndependents will be granted status under the bill. Of the 11 million, \nthey say 7 million will be granted status.\n  Additionally, the CBO and the White House estimate this bill will \nincrease current immigration levels--which are now about 1 million a \nyear legally--by about 8 million over a 10-year period, making total \nimmigration into the United States over the next 10 years nearly 18 \nmillion instead of the currently expected 10 million, setting aside \nthose who get amnesty.\n  Under various provisions of current law, the United States issues \njust under 1 million--approximately 950,000--green cards every year to \npeople coming through immigration channels legally.\n  In 10 years, if this law remains the same as today, almost 10 million \npeople will join the United States. Over 20 years, it would be about \n18.9 million people--just under 20 million--under current law.\n  Under this bill that is on the floor today, we have been shocked to \nfind the breadth of the numbers.\n  Almost 2 weeks ago, my staff and the Heritage Foundation did separate \nextensive analyses to determine the total number of people who would be \ncoming into America under this bill, if it passes.\n  At a press conference last Monday--the first time anybody had even \ndiscussed it--Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the Heritage \nFoundation, joined with me to reveal the results of our studies and to \nshed some light on the future immigration policy changes in the bill.\n  According to my projections, the bill would have increased the legal \nimmigration population by 78 million to 217 million over the course of \nthe next 20 years. I would note, the current population of the United \nStates today is less than 300 million. So 100 million would be a one-\nthird increase in the population by immigration; 200 million, of \ncourse, would be two-thirds of an increase in the population.\n  Mr. Rector's estimate was within the range I projected--coming in at \n100 million over the course of 20 years. I just tried to figure out \nwhat the low numbers could be and the high numbers could be. He focused \non what he thought the number would turn out to be. He found it to be \n103 million people over the next 20 years--one-third of the current \npopulation of the United States of America.\n  So the day after those numbers were released, the Senate adopted an \namendment offered by Senator Bingaman--I see him on the floor today--\nwhich is, I think, perhaps, the most significant amendment we have \nadopted to date, that capped the number of people who could come into \nthe country under that bill's new H-2C temporary guest worker program \nat 200,000 per year, not 325,000. And it ended this 20-percent \nautomatic escalator clause.\n  I say to Senator Bingaman, I thank you for your effectiveness on that \namendment. And it ended up having a pretty nice vote. But until that \ntime, we had not begun to discuss on the floor of the Senate anything \nother than enforcement at the border and amnesty provisions. We had not \neven thought about it. How did they put this in there? How did they \ncome up with an automatic 20-percent increase in immigration for a low-\nskilled provision of this bill? Who wrote that in there? Did anybody \neven know it was there?\n  If my fine staff had not been digging into it, I am not sure it would \nhave been found. Well, the Heritage Foundation also dug into it, but \nawfully late. The bill had been tried to be pushed through this Senate \nabout a month ago without any debate, without any amendments. They were \njust going to move that through. So it was a good improvement.\n\n  We now expect, after this however, that the numbers are still huge. I \nproject the expected numbers in the next 20 years will be between 73 \nmillion and 92 million. Robert Rector has estimated that it will be 66 \nmillion over the next 210 years. He didn't include H-1B in his \ncalculations.\n  So without any growth in the H-1B, the high-skilled visa program, we \ncome in at 73 million. Under the maximum growth, we would come in at 92 \nmillion. Current levels, under current law, would be 10 million. Now, \nthat is a big, big deal. It represents a serious policy decision of the \npeople of the United States. And how many American people know we are \ntalking about that? And 92 million is over four times the current rate \nof immigration in this country--five times really. From where did that \ncome?\n  So even after Senator Bingaman's effective amendment, it is important \nto remember that both the Heritage Foundation's--Mr. Robert Rector's--\nprojections and mine calculate the bill will still increase current \nlevels of immigration three- to fivefold over the next 20 years. The \nrealistic estimate, I think, is four times the current rate. Is that \nwhat we need? Maybe it is. But we sure have not talked about it. Have \nyou heard the American people consulted on that? We already have a \npretty generous immigration system, I submit. It brings in a million \npeople a year.\n  People say: Well, you have lots of illegal immigrants too. That would \nbe 50 percent more, maybe 500,000 a year, as estimated. That is not \nthree, four, five times the current rate.\n  Last Tuesday, the CBO released its final score of the Senate \nimmigration bill. They estimated that if it passes, it would result in \nan 8 million person increase in the population over the first 10 years. \nThe precise estimate is 7.8 million, which can be found on page 4 of \nthe CBO score.\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\n  This estimated 8 million increase accounts for only future legal \nimmigration caused by the bill. It does not include an estimate for the \nnumber of illegal aliens. We are not going to take that to zero, \nsurely. Surely, we will make some progress to reduce illegal \nimmigration, but it is not going to zero.\n  The CBO estimate for how many in the illegal alien population would \nbenefit from the bill's amnesty provisions is contained in a separate \ncalculation on page 22. On page 22, CBO estimates that 1 million \nillegal aliens will be adjusted under the AgJOBS provisions, and that \ntwo-thirds of the 6 million illegal aliens here for more than 5 years, \nand 50 percent of the 2 million illegal aliens here between 2 and 5 \nyears, will adjust status under the bill's provisions.\n  So according to CBO, a total of 6 million illegal immigrants will \nbecome legal permanent--permanent--residents under the bill and be \nplaced on an automatic path to citizenship.\n  Now, the White House, last Thursday, in a press release, entitled \n``Setting the Record Straight''--OK--wholeheartedly embraced the CBO \nreport and claimed that the 8 million future immigration estimate by \nCBO is ``consistent with most research on immigration issues.''\n  The White House press release also embraced the CBO estimate on the \ncurrent illegal alien population but stated it a little differently. \nAccording to the White House, CBO estimated that about one-third of \nillegal immigrants eligible for legalization under the bill are \nunlikely to become legal permanent residents. Therefore, the logical \nconclusion of this statement is that two-thirds of the eligible illegal \nalien population will likely become legal permanent residents.\n  The White House press statement directly implies that the White House \ndoes not expect more than two-thirds of the illegal alien population to \nbecome legal permanent residents under the bill.\n  If 10.3 million people have been illegally present for more than 2 \nyears, two-thirds of that number would mean approximately 7 million \npeople now living here illegally will benefit from the amnesty \nprovisions. This estimate--7 million--is 1 million higher than the way \nCBO lays out the numbers on page 22 of their score.\n  As the press statement points out, these estimates are much lower \nthan the estimates that Robert Rector or my staff, after extensive \nreview, came up with.\n  Although I highly doubt we have true numbers from the CBO, I \nsincerely hope they are accurate, and not mine. It is imperative that \nthe American people, however, be able to trust their Government--\nparticularly those agencies that enforce these laws--when discussing \nissues such as these. My amendment will adopt the CBO and White House \nestimates as the realistic result of S. 2611's increases in \nimmigration.\n  Under the amendment we are offering, the number of green cards that \nCBO and the White House estimate will be needed will be made available \nfor the adjustment of status provisions and future immigration levels \ncaused by the bill.\n  First, the amendment limits the number of green cards available under \nthe bill's amnesty provisions to two-thirds of the qualified illegal \nalien population of about 10.3 million--a total of 7 million green \ncards.\n  Second, the amendment limits the increase in future immigration to 8 \nmillion above the current level of 10 million over 10 years. Under the \namendment, the total number of green cards issued shall not exceed 18 \nmillion over any 10-year period, starting with the 2007-2016 10-year \nperiod.\n  Because real numbers of current immigration levels would only reach \nabout 9,500,000 in 10 years, an additional 500,000 green cards are \nadded to the White House's estimate in this amendment.\n  It is important that we limit the bill's effects to the numbers being \nused to justify the bill's passage, at least. The American people are \nmuch more accepting when they know the numbers we are asking them to \nbelieve in. And they are asking us to make sure we tell them \ntruthfully, and that we comply with it. Though I am not in favor of \ngranting amnesty to those who break the law, I believe it is important \nto hold the administration to its word when enacting a comprehensive \nreform bill.\n\n  My amendment limits the number of illegal aliens who can be granted \namnesty under the bill. This limit will in turn limit the potential for \nfraudulent adjustments of status. It would also say if there were more \nclaiming for green cards under amnesty than projected, and they met all \nthe qualifications, they would get those green cards, but the future \nflow numbers would be reduced to cover that. Unlike the bill as \nwritten, my amendment would allow for a controlled increase in legal \nmigration by placing a cap on the number of green cards that can be \nissued under the bill's other provisions. The fact is, we cannot admit \neveryone who wants to come to our country. Unlimited immigration will \nput a strain on finite resources. Therefore, in addition to properly \nenforcing our laws and securing our borders, we must put reasonable \nlimits on the number of people who can enter permanently.\n  Under my amendment, future immigration will be increased by--hold \nyour hat--80 percent, but not as much as the current bill allows, 300 \nto 500 percent. Eighty percent is too high. We haven't had the evidence \nto justify that, but I am saying, let's put this up for a vote so when \nthis bill goes through here, we will at least know what the top level \nis.\n  This amendment is sensible and responsible. I ask my colleagues to \nvote for it. Later, I hope to have the opportunity in the debate--I see \nothers, and I won't utilize any more time--to talk in more detail about \nthe earned-income tax credit amendment, the need to reform in a \nsignificant way the unprincipled chain migration provisions of the \nbill, and the H-2C green cards future flow cap for H-2C green cards to \nbe issued.\n  I thank my colleagues for their time. I urge each one of us to spend \nsome serious time in analyzing the impact of this hugely important \npiece of legislation that the American people care about, and \nrightfully so. It is our responsibility to get it right. We don't want \nto be back here, as Senator Grassley has done today, and say we have \nmade a mistake in 2006.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority whip.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4860-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4860-S4862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today because five families in \nHarlan County in the Commonwealth of Kentucky suffered a devastating \nand tragic loss this past weekend. As many of our colleagues are aware, \nan explosion rocked the Kentucky Darby Mine No. 1 around 1:30 Saturday \nmorning.\n  According to news reports, the blast occurred nearly a mile \nunderground near a sealed-off area of the mine. The force of the \nexplosion was so powerful it caused damage over 5,000 feet up at the \nmine opening.\n  Five miners were killed. Their families are, of course, completely \ndevastated, and the entire community is struggling for answers in the \nface of such a catastrophe, an unexpected tragedy that is so \noverwhelming it breaks your heart and almost leaves you numb.\n  There is one ray of light in this otherwise very dark episode. One \nminer, a man named Paul Ledford of Dayhoit, KY, managed to escape the \nblast. He was injured but reportedly was still able to walk out of the \nmine on his own two feet. After a short stay in the hospital, he was \nreleased, and I am sure his family is thrilled that he survived the \ncatastrophe.\n  The Darby mine explosion brings this year's total number of deaths \nfrom mining accidents in Kentucky to 10, double what it was just 72 \nhours ago. Thank goodness Paul Ledford's name is not on that list.\n  But these Kentuckians' names are: Paris Thomas, Jr., 53, of \nClosplint; George William Petra, 49, of Kenvir; Jimmy B. Lee, 33, of \nWallins Creek; Amon ``Cotton'' Brock, 51, of Closplint; and Roy \nMiddleton, 35, of Evarts. All were lost in this explosion Saturday.\n  The Harlan County coroner's report indicates that Amon Brock and \nJimmy\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nLee were killed instantly by the tremendous force of the explosion. The \nother three survived long enough to put on breathing devices, but still \ndied of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n  Their loved ones will never forget the last time they saw them before \nthey descended into the mines. Nor will they forget the calamity that, \nsadly, added their names to this list. Neither should we ever forget \nthem.\n  The authorities are still investigating the cause of this accident. \nSome accidents are, unfortunately, entirely unpreventable. But other \naccidents are all the more horrific because they could have been \nprevented. When it comes to the second type, this Senate can and must \nact to prevent them. The list of Kentucky mining deaths is too long \nalready.\n  I am sure my colleagues, Senator Rockefeller and Senator Byrd, will \nagree that the list of West Virginia names is too long as well. Every \nAmerican watched the terrible events at the Sago mine this past \nJanuary, when 12 miners were killed.\n  The Senate should act quickly by passing S. 2803, the Mine \nImprovement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, of which, I am \nhappy to say, I am a cosponsor.\n  This measure, drafted by Senators Enzi and Kennedy, was unanimously \nreported out of the HELP Committee last week, and the Senate should \nmove expeditiously to pass this legislation. It is the most \ncomprehensive package of miner-safety legislation in a generation. Once \nit is fully implemented, the brave men and women who descend in the \ndarkness to provide the rest of us with light and heat will have safer \nworking conditions than ever before.\n  The MINER Act, as it is called, will require mining companies to \nsubmit to the Mine Safety and Health Administration, MSHA, up-to-date \nemergency preparedness and response plans. The plans must be adapted to \neach individual mine, and MSHA must review and recertify them every 6 \nmonths. As conditions change, so must the response plans in order to \nbest protect our miners.\n  The bill will require the mining companies to put in place state-of-\nthe-art, two-way wireless communications and electronic tracking \nsystems. Mine rescue team response will be both faster and safer.\n  The bill will require every miner to have at least 2 hours of oxygen \non hand and stores of oxygen to be stashed every 30 minutes along \nescape routes for evacuating miners. Randal McCloy, Jr., the only miner \nwho survived the Sago tragedy, has reported that at least four of his \nfellow miners' air packs were faulty, leaving the team without enough \nair.\n\n  Given the fact that three of the miners in the Darby mine died with \ntheir breathing masks on, it seems the same thing happened yet again in \nKentucky this weekend. That is unacceptable and must not be tolerated.\n  The bill will give the Secretary of Labor new, stronger enforcement \npowers to ensure the mines are in compliance. The Secretary will have \nthe authority to shut down a mine for failing to meet the Department's \norders, and the bill raises penalties significantly for serious \nviolations.\n  The bill will also clarify that mine safety rescue teams are not \nliable for any injuries or deaths that may happen due to rescue \nactivities. This is important because up to now, some mining companies \nhave hesitated to have mine rescue teams for fear of being sued. This \nprovision of the bill will ensure the mining companies have the \nincentive to put a mine rescue team in place.\n  Finally, the bill will create grant programs to improve safety \ntraining, direct studies of safety techniques, and create an \ninteragency group to facilitate the development of new safety \ntechnologies and activities.\n  I understand this may not be the perfect bill. Not everyone has \ngotten everything in it they want. But it represents the best, most \ncomprehensive approach to this problem in many years. In fact, both the \nNational Mining Association and the United Mine Workers of America have \nendorsed it. That ought to tell you something right there. These two \ngroups don't agree on things very often, so I am sure my colleagues can \nsee how their agreement is a signal that the MINER Act is the \nbreakthrough that we have been waiting for.\n  It is too late for us to do anything for the five Kentucky miners who \ndied this Saturday. Right now the healing for their families and that \ncommunity is happening in Harlan County. I was touched by an article I \nread today about a memorial service that took place at the Closplint \nChurch of God in Clospint, KY, just 10 miles down the road from the \nDarby mine. The Rev. Frank Howard led a prayer for the victims' \nfamilies. He said, ``We're a coal community, and we need to lift each \nother up.''\n  I know the people of Harlan County well. And I am sure of this: They \ncertainly do have the strength to lift each other up in this hour of \nanguish. And when they need help, they will get it. It will pour in \nfrom every corner of Kentucky and beyond.\n  So we here in the Nation's Capital must also do our part. When this \nGovernment acts swiftly and with purpose, we can uplift the fortunes of \nmany who may otherwise be cursed to suffer in despair. By passing this \nlegislation, we can lessen the burden on others who work in the mines \nand their families by letting them know that we are listening and doing \neverything we can.\n  It is my understanding that efforts are underway on both sides to get \nthis legislation cleared, we hope, as soon as tomorrow. But there is \none other thing we ought to do. I was looking at the Executive \nCalendar. I noticed that the MSHA, the Mine Safety and Health \nAdministration, is without a Director, and not because the HELP \nCommittee has not acted. On March 8, 2006, the HELP Committee reported \nout an individual from West Virginia to be Director of the Mine Safety \nand Health Administration. His nomination has been languishing on the \ncalendar for 2\\1/2\\ months. I can't think of a worse time to have MSHA \nwithout a permanent Director than now. We have had a raft of coal mine \ndeaths this year in West Virginia and Kentucky. With coal production up \nand coal prices up, it is a virtual certainty that more and more coal \nis going to be mined. Therefore, more and more miners will be involved \nin mining coal. We need a permanent Director of MSHA, and we need to \npass the legislation I hope we will pass tomorrow.\n  I know there has been a hold on the MSHA Director nomination on the \nother side of the aisle. I have been told that there will be an \nobjection yet again today. But I want to plead with those from the \nother side who may believe that this is not the perfect nominee--he is \nthe nominee, nominated by the President, reported out of the HELP \nCommittee. If he were to be drawn down and this whole process were to \nbe started all over again, we wouldn't have an MSHA Director for months \nand months into the future. We need a permanent Director of the Mine \nSafety and Health Administration.\n  Bearing that in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 553, \nthe nomination of Richard Stickler of West Virginia to be the Assistant \nSecretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health; provided further that \nthe nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand the Senate resume legislative session.\n  Before the Chair rules, as I have indicated already, let me say \nagain, this nominee has been reported out of the HELP Committee. He has \nbeen on the calendar since March 8 of this year. MSHA is without a \npermanent Director, and I would hope that my unanimous consent request \nwill not be objected to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the Democratic leader, I \nhave been requested to object, and I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if the Senator from Kentucky will yield \nfor a question, just a few years ago, not long after 9/11, we had the \nBrookwood mine disaster in Alabama, where 13 miners lost their lives. \nBasically, like the firemen in New York, they were responding to help \nsomeone in need, another miner that they believed needed help in an \nemergency, and lost their lives in a rescue attempt. It was a very \nemotional time for me and the families and\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\nthe town. We were joined on that occasion at the Brookwood mine area by \nthe Secretary of Labor, Elaine Chao. I want you to know how proud I was \nof her that night. She went over to the union hall.\n  She had to be up at 5 o'clock the next morning to catch a flight. But \nshe stayed there almost 2 hours meeting and talking with the victims of \nthat disaster. I was able to call just Friday several family members \nand others who were involved in that to tell them of the passage of \nthis piece of legislation out of committee. They were very excited \nabout it--a lawyer for the union official, families of people who were \nkilled in that disaster. As the Senator said, the price of coal is up. \nThe demand for energy is up. We are going to be doing more mining. This \nlegislation will clearly be a step forward into making those mines \nsafer. I thank him for those comments. I hope we can move rapidly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, before yielding the floor, I thank my \nfriend from Alabama. I hope this legislation will clear the Senate \nsometime tomorrow. I know people are working on both sides of the aisle \nto get it cleared. It should not be controversial. After all, it came \nout of committee unanimously. It is supported by the National Mining \nAssociation and the UMWA. We need to get that bill passed.\n  I hope, also, we can get a permanent Director of MSHA. It is without \na permanent Director at a very important time in the life and safety of \nour Nation's coal miners.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I certainly agree with that. I just ask \nthat when the Senator gets home tonight, he thank the Secretary of \nLabor for the good work she has given to the committee in helping us \npass this legislation.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4862-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4862-S4880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2006--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss.) The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly this afternoon \nabout two amendments that I intend to offer, and I hope can be \nfavorably considered by the Senate before this bill is completed. The \nfirst will just take a moment. It relates to forestry workers.\n  This is amendment No. 4055. It would make H-2B guest workers who are \ninvited here to work in our forestry sector eligible for limited legal \naid. I believe this amendment should be noncontroversial. Under current \nlaw, agricultural guest workers are eligible for legal aid with respect \nto employment rights provided for in their H-2A contract. This \namendment would provide H-2B forestry workers with the same eligibility \nfor legal aid. We have had hearings in our Energy Committee on the \nissue. We had a recent hearing where we heard that making H-2B forestry \nworkers eligible for legal aid is the single most effective thing \nCongress could do to address the problem of exploitation of forestry \nworkers.\n  These guest workers have been asked to come to the United States \nbecause of a labor shortage that was certified by our Government. They \nare here legally. They pay U.S. taxes. Currently, the law prohibits \nlegal-services-funded organizations from providing them with any legal \naid to enforce their rights under their guest worker contract. The \namendment would correct this issue, and I hope that this amendment can \nbe adopted when it is appropriate to take action on it.\n  Mr. President, I also want to talk about another amendment which goes \nto the issue of the number of employment-based immigrant visas admitted \neach year--the number of employment-based immigrants that we admit each \nyear under the current version of this immigration bill as it stands in \nthe Senate today. Let me first describe the big picture as I see it, as \nfar as people becoming legal permanent residents under our laws.\n  First, let me preface this entire discussion by saying that none of \nwhat I am talking about relates to the people who are here on an \nundocumented basis today. There are other provisions of the law that \napply to them and that give them rights under this proposed legislation \nto adjust their status and become legal permanent residents at some \nstage down the road. So that is separate. I am not in any way talking \nabout that. I know that has been a subject of great controversy in the \nSenate and in the Congress in general, but that is not the purpose of \nmy proposed amendment.\n  When you talk about people who are not here illegally today, there \nare basically two major ways that a person can become a legal permanent \nresident under our immigration laws. The two ways are through the \nfamily-based visa program or through the employment-based visa program. \nThis chart shows the numbers that have been admitted into the country \nup until the end of 2004 through the family-based and employment-based \nprograms combined, under both of those. You can see that those two \ntogether--it comes out to somewhere around 800,000. That is a total \nannual figure I am talking about for people coming and getting legal \npermanent residency through both of those major avenues.\n  Now, this legislation we are talking about would, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, substantially increase those numbers. \nYou can see that their projection--and this is an estimate because, in \nfact, we are eliminating some caps that have been in the law \npreviously, and I will discuss that in a minute. But these estimates \nfrom the Congressional Research Service are that we will get closer to \n2 million legal permanent residents that we are accepting each year \nunder this legislation. So that is the overall picture.\n\n  The amendment I am talking about does not try to deal with this \nentire picture. It just looks at the employment-based legal permanent \nresident visas.\n  Let me go to a different chart in order to describe the concern I \nhave. Current law says there is a cap of 140,000 persons, or 140,000 \nvisas, that can be issued under the employment-based LPR categories of \nour laws. That has been the case now for some time--140,000 per year. \nThis includes family. These are people who come here and seek legal \npermanent status in order to take work. But it also includes their \nfamilies. Each member of the family, of course, uses a visa as well. So \nthe total number of employees under this system, and family, spouse, \nand children, does not exceed 140,000. That is what the law currently \nprovides.\n  Now, when Senators McCain and Kennedy--this is my understanding of \nthe history, and I am sorry that neither Senators McCain or Kennedy are \nhere so they could correct me in case I misstated anything, but my \nunderstanding is that they concluded that we needed to reform the law, \nand part of the reform that we should adopt was to clear out the \nbacklog and make more room for additional immigration under this \nemployment-based LPR system. I agree with that. Clearly, that is one of \nthe purposes of this legislation and one of the effects of this \nlegislation.\n  They set out to do this in several different ways. Let me mention the \nthree main ways that they set out to do it. First of all, they said \nlet's clear out the backlog. By that, it is meant in the legislation \nthat any visa that was available to be issued in the last 5 years that \nwas not issued because the immigration service could not get the \nprocessing done--that any of those visas would be once again made \navailable. And the estimate we have from the Congressional Research \nService is that there are about 140,000 of those.\n  So we are going back for the last 5 years and saying: OK, are there \nvisas that should have been or could have been issued? Let's bring \nthose forward and issue them and make them available again. Clearly, I \nsupport doing that.\n  They also said: OK, in order to help clear out the backlog, we need \nto encourage some groups to come here and exempt them from any of this \ncap. This idea that we only allow 140,000 people to come should not \napply to people we are particularly interested in bringing to this \ncountry, for whatever reason. One idea is to allow students who come \nhere to be exempted from the cap so they can remain here and become \nlegal permanent residents--scientists, technicians, engineers, people \nwith careers in mathematics. We need those people to create a strong \neconomy. Let's allow them to come.\n  They said also let's eliminate some of these schedule A groups; that \nis, people who have specialty occupations we\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nneed to bring here. So let's take them out from under the cap. Again, I \nhave no problem with that approach.\n  The one other thing they said, which is a major change in the law--\nthis was the bill they introduced last May, the McCain-Kennedy \nlegislation--is that we should raise the cap, that we have outgrown \nthat. Let's raise it to 290,000, so the total number of people who are \nbeing allowed to come each year--employees and their spouses and \nchildren--will be 290,000, in addition to the ones permitted to come \nbecause of our bringing these visas forward from previous years and in \naddition to the people who come not subject to any cap at all.\n  That is how the McCain-Kennedy legislation was introduced. Frankly, \nmy own reaction was that it sounded like a fairly reasonable approach. \nThen the Judiciary Committee decided to proceed with legislation, and \nthe Judiciary Committee began to mark up the chairman's bill--Senator \nSpecter's bill--and as I understand what occurred there, and in reading \nthe record of those hearings, the Specter bill agreed with the effort \nto clear out the backlog that I have described, agreed with the effort \nto exempt certain groups from the 290,000-person cap. It agreed to keep \nthe number 290,000, but they changed the definition of what the 290,000 \napplied to.\n  Under McCain-Kennedy, it had been a cap on the number of workers, \nalong with their accompanying family members. Under the Specter \nlegislation, it was defined as a cap on the workers themselves, and \nthere was to be no cap on the spouses and family members.\n  If you look at this chart, you can see the progression. Current law \nis the first column. The second column is S. 1033, which takes it up to \n290,000. Then the third column is the one that is the chairman's mark \nthat was marked up and reported by the Judiciary Committee, and that is \nthe one that keeps the 290,000 but says: OK, on top of that we are \ngoing to allow spouses and family members.\n  On this chart, you see an estimated 638,000. The reason I put that in \nis because the Congressional Research Service was asked how many \nspouses and family members they expect to come along with these people? \nThey said, looking back at past history, they estimate perhaps at least \n1.2 people per employee. So you would be talking about 638,000, \nroughly, under that legislation. But that is an estimate. This is the \nfirst time we have not had a cap. We have an estimate instead of a \ncap. So the obvious question we have to deal with is whether that is \nthe right level.\n\n  As we all know, the legislation that came through the Judiciary \nCommittee was changed once it got to the floor, and we then began to \nwork on what is called the Hagel-Martinez legislation. That is the \nlegislation pending today. That is the legislation about which we are \nhaving a great deal of discussion.\n  Let me recount what the Hagel-Martinez legislation does. That is the \nfourth of these columns. The Hagel-Martinez legislation says that we \nagree with the proposal to clear out the backlog, just as McCain-\nKennedy did. They are saying they agree with the proposal to exempt \ncertain categories from the cap. That was also in the McCain-Kennedy \nproposal. And they agree with the Specter proposal that the definition \nof who should be covered should not include spouses and family members. \nBut they also believed the 290,000 was too low a figure, and they \nraised it to 450,000. What we have now is 450,000 workers permitted to \ncome and no limit on the number of spouses and family members who can \naccompany them. That is the legislation pending before us. That \ncontinues under the bill, as it is before us, for a 10-year period, \nthrough 2016. After 2016, for the period from then on, it drops back to \n290,000, plus their spouses and family members, rather than the \n450,000.\n  Why did Hagel-Martinez insist upon going to this 450,000 instead of \n290,000? That is the obvious question. They did it for a very logical \nreason. They did it because they were providing that a certain group of \nthose who are currently in the country--that is, people who have been \nhere at least 2 years and fewer than 5 years--that group of individuals \nwould have to go through this same system, so they had to increase the \namount of that cap as they saw it.\n  What I am suggesting we ought to do first and what my amendment will \npropose, once I have the opportunity to offer my amendment, is we \nshould put a cap on the total number of people we are allowing into the \ncountry under this employment-based legal permanent residency visa \nprogram.\n  We have always had a cap on the number of immigrants coming into this \ncountry on an employment-based system. We have done that now for well \nover half a century. I think we have done it for over a century. I \nthink it would be a fairly radical change for us to say we are giving \nup on having any cap on this group and instead we are going to an open-\nended system, and we will work on estimates.\n  Part of the debate we have had in the Senate, frankly, is the result \nof the fact that we don't have a hard cap for how many people will \nactually be admitted each year. I believe that is not good public \npolicy. It is not fair to the Immigration Service, which has to plan \nfor the number of employees they will need and the number of \napplications they will receive each year. We are much better off having \na cap.\n  I also believe we should make it clear that whatever cap we have on \nthis group excludes those aliens who are adjusting their status because \nthey have been here from 2 to 5 years. If they are in that category, \nthey should not be counted in the numbers we calculate.\n  My amendment would try to exclude that group and would basically \notherwise take the numbers that are estimated by the Congressional \nResearch Service and say: OK, let's go ahead and put a cap, and let's \nmake it a 650,000-person cap each year. That is slightly more than the \nCongressional Research Service estimated would be required or would be \nexpected to apply. It is a substantial increase over current law, more \nthan four times, nearly five times the current level. It is \nsubstantially more than twice what Senators McCain and Kennedy proposed \nin their legislation.\n  I think, frankly, it would be a major liberalization of our laws. I \nknow there are those who will argue that we shouldn't have any cap at \nall, but I think that is not a wise course. This legislation will be \nimproved if we can assure our constituents that we have a cap on the \nnumber of people who are coming in under this employment-based system. \nThat is what the amendment will do.\n  I hope to be able to explain it further when we get closer to \nactually offering the amendment. I am told we cannot offer an amendment \ntoday. This would be a very useful change and improvement in the \npending legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues will take the time to look at this issue and \nwill educate themselves on what the effect of the current proposed \nlegislation would be and the reasons we should put some cap on that \nnumber. I believe it would be a wise course to follow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from New Mexico. \nHe has approached this very contentious and very complicated issue in a \nvery thoughtful way, looking at realities and numbers. I appreciate his \nobservations today. His proposal, and an amendment he offered that was \nadopted last week, changes the numbers. I am not going to stand here on \nthe floor as an advocate of the legislation and suggest we have gotten \nit right, but we spent a great deal of time attempting to get it right, \nrecognizing the importance of the migrant labor force inside the \nAmerican economy and, at the same time, recognizing the wishes of the \nAmerican people to make it a transparent legal process with secured \nborders. That is what they are asking of us. I hope, as we finalize \nthis legislation this week, that is the outcome of it before we send \nthe bill to the President for his signature.\n  I have come to the Chamber this afternoon to talk once again about an \nissue that is before us. The Presiding Officer is the author of the \namendment. Again, it is one that, in part, is a bit technical. I \nsuggest this afternoon in my opposition to the amendment that it is \npredicated on what I hope are appropriately the unforeseen consequences \nof this amendment and the impact it would have on American agricultural \nemployment.\n  Last Thursday night, Senator Chambliss opened the debate on his\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\namendment, and I talked about its impact on the users of the H-2A \nagricultural guest worker program. To get right to the bottom line, my \nargument is that the Senate should keep the provision that is in the \nbill now and deny Senator Chambliss the success of his amendment. Why? \nA deal doesn't necessarily have to be a deal, but at the same time, \nover the course of the last 4 years, in negotiating with agricultural \nemployees and agricultural employers, we attempted to bring some \nrationale to a method of compensation under the H-2A program that \nsimply in most opinions was out of touch with reality. It was \nescalating on an automatic basis every year, and it simply was not \nfitting the need, especially when more and more in agriculture were \nillegal and were not under that program.\n\n  Now a small minority actually, some 40,000-plus a year, are under the \nH-2A program and identified with the wage set by that program. It is \npossible--and we are not sure--but a million-plus are not and are \nsimply out there in the marketplace bidding for a salary that, in most \ninstances, is below the H-2A adverse wage that is proposed.\n  So what did we do? Recognizing that disparity, we reached back, with \nthe agreement of all of the parties involved, and said that one of the \npieces of getting this puzzle right was to freeze that wage in 2003 at \nthe 2002 level, and that is what is in the bill. So that pushes that \nwage scale back substantially for a period of 3 years while we look at \nwhat Senator Chambliss has attempted to do in his legislation in \ndeveloping a prevailing wage for American agricultural employers and \nemployees that fit into this guest worker category.\n  I don't know that we, with all of the different categories of wages, \ncan automatically put it all under one at this time. Of course, that is \nwhat the Senator attempts to do. The agriculture section of S. 2611, as \nI said, immediately drops that wage down, and then over a period of 3 \nyears, we look at it and adjust as the program is adjusting because we \nare not going to have everybody inside the program once it becomes law \nfor a period of several years as the program adjusts and as we work our \nway through and people begin to qualify under the blue card system that \nwe proposed to become legal workers and have permanent visas for the \npurpose of moving back and forth across the border as guest workers to \nwork in American agriculture.\n  What I have attempted to do and what I am attempting to understand is \nwhat in the bill is now the best deal for American agriculture. That is \none reason I believe a vote on the Chambliss amendment is not a good \ndeal for American agriculture at this moment. But that is not the only \nreason. Let me talk about the rest of agriculture, the million-plus who \nwill now be affected by the Chambliss amendment if it is to become law, \nbecause I see that as the rest of the story, and the rest of the story \ndeals with the blue card and the blue card transitional program, the \nearned status which is a part of the whole of this program. It isn't \njust a matter of putting in a wage; it is a matter of how that wage \nultimately affects the transition into a blue card status.\n  We have done a pictorial chart tonight that I think better explains \nwhat we are talking about.\n  We believe the blue card built within the agricultural jobs is that \ntransitional tool which allows American agriculture to cross the chasm, \nif you will, and allow a reformed H-2A program, a guest worker program, \nto come into being. It won't happen overnight, but it will happen under \nthe law, and it will happen with a wage scale that is pushed back as we \nmake sure we get it right. That is under the reform program.\n  The second part of the agricultural jobs is a one-time-only program, \nright here, a blue card. It will last for a specific period of time \nwhile we are transitioning the illegals here today into a legal status \nso they can continue to work and move back and forth across the border \nin a guest worker program.\n  The blue card program is a critical piece of the agricultural job \nsolution. It is an essential transition program. Let me repeat, \nagriculture needs this blue card if we don't want to throw it \nimmediately into havoc because agriculture, whether we like it or not, \nbased on an H-2A law that didn't work at all well and a very \ntransparent border, has grown increasingly dependent on an illegal \nworkforce. There are no wage requirements for blue card workers in the \nbill. It is only the 40,000-plus H-2A we shove back. They are paid \nwhatever the farmer is paying, whatever the current wage is in the \narea, and other workers are gaining. And those wages would differ from \nplace to place and job to job, farm to farm.\n\n  What the Chambliss amendment does, however, is it says that blue card \nworkers must be paid a prevailing wage. It pushes the base up \nsubstantially. The Chambliss amendment doesn't just deal with the wages \nof the H-2A program, the 40-plus, it applies the same fix to every \nfarmer who employs a blue card transitional worker.\n  Now, why is that significant? Here is why: By definition, the \nprevailing wage is neither the lowest nor the highest wage; it is just \nabout in the middle or between the two. It is the 51st percentile in \nwages. So even if a farmer is paying a lower wage for a particular job, \nif he hires a blue card worker, if the Chambliss amendment becomes law, \nhe is going to have to pay the blue card worker a higher wage than he \nis currently paying today. And if the Chambliss amendment is adopted, \nthe lower 50th percentile of wages, that is the figure that becomes the \ncalculating base for the next year. While you freeze for 3 years and \nlet the wage scale work as it is, the Chambliss amendment begins to \nratchet the wages up, setting them at a 51st percentile level. I don't \nthink American agriculture has that one figured out yet.\n  What could ultimately happen is that we lose the value of the \ntransition of the blue card, especially when it comes to vegetable \ncrops and crops that can move very quickly out of this country that \naren't mechanized and are labor intensive. Already, we are beginning to \nlose those farmers because the worker isn't there. If all of a sudden \nthat wage scale shoots up under the Chambliss bill, as I propose it \nwill, to a prevailing status, my guess is not only will you not have \nthe worker but you will not have the producer out there in the field \nsimply because they will not be able to afford to pay that wage in a \ncompetitive way. More and more of our production, tragically enough, I \nbelieve will go south of the border in some of these areas. Much of \nthat production today happens outside the United States.\n  So I think when we are talking about what sounds like a good idea, we \nbetter put it in the context of what the bill is really about; that is, \nthe transitional time of 2 to 3 years of blue card workers who are in \nthe market today working at a variety of wages, depending upon the \nparticular job, the particular type of agriculture, and all of a sudden \nestablishing a whole new wage base substantially above where they are \nbeing paid but, as the Senator from Georgia would argue, below H-2A. \nBut remember, once again, only about 45,000 workers are in H-2A, and \nthere are well over a million who are all of a sudden going to be \naffected by the blue card status and by the Chambliss amendment. So it \nis tremendously important that we bring this into context.\n  Now, that is not going to be just a couple of workers, as I said. \nThat is nearly 70 percent of the current agricultural workforce we \nbelieve to be undocumented. Not all of those workers are going to \nqualify for the blue card program, but a lot of them will. Our blue \ncard program envisions that it could go as high as, over a 3-year \nperiod, 1.5 million, and if I am not mistaken, those higher wages won't \nbe limited to the blue card worker.\n  But what the Senator from Georgia is doing is setting a new, higher \nfloor for all agricultural employment. Somehow, you are talking about \ninflating the wages of a large percentage of the American agricultural \nworkforce. I am not against higher salaries. I am for a fair salary. \nWhat I am concerned about in particular is labor-intense areas, and \nthose crops will simply cease to exist and they will go south of the \nborder, to Chile or somewhere else. In areas of agriculture that are \nhighly mechanized, there will be limited to no effect. And it is that \nwhich I believe we have to put into context.\n  So what is the result? The result is that employers, in my opinion, \nwon't be able to afford blue card workers. Is\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\nthat the intent of the Senator from Georgia? I don't think so, but I \nbelieve it is the unintended consequence we are talking about and \nsomething I think my colleagues need to understand.\n  Part of that was the discussion over the last 4 years. This is \nsomething which didn't just come up yesterday. There were 4 years of \nnegotiation between the employer and the employees as to how to get an \nH-2A wage right. We had the adverse wage for a lot of reasons, such as \nbecause of where agriculture was located and because housing wasn't \navailable. There were a lot of things that were brought into that \ndiscussion. We know our country has changed since the creation of the \nfirst H-2A law. And while there are still other benefits tied to the \nwage, that is why we could effectively negotiate rolling that wage back \nand allowing American agriculture and the employers in American \nagriculture to effectively look at what we were doing and strike the \nkind of balanced margin that is necessary.\n  What happens? What happens if the blue card is removed? I am going to \nargue tonight that the Chambliss amendment has the effect of removing \nthe blue card substantially because it inflates that lower wage base \nsignificantly. What happens if it is removed? The bridge that is the \nchasm we cross as we transition with American agriculture into a \nlegal--a legal--guest worker program goes away. That is what I am \nworried about, dramatically worried about, and that is why I am urging \nmy colleagues to vote against the Chambliss amendment because I think \nif that goes away, there is no transition. Within a very short time, \neven under tight labor conditions today, because our borders are \ngetting tighter and because of shifts in the workforce, this drives \nthat workforce even further out of the ability to be hired by much of \nAmerican agriculture. I think it is tremendously important that we look \nat all of that and understand it.\n  Here is something else that is ironic. The Chambliss amendment \ncreates a federally mandated wage base for American agriculture. Some \nwill argue that we have done it in a couple of other areas, but most of \nus will say the market ought to work. It was only in the unique status \nof H-2A that we had a different kind of wage base. I will argue today, \nand I think appropriately so, that we are setting an entirely new \nstandard for 70 percent of the American workforce. Instead of allowing \nus to make sure that it fits right in the program, looks at the \ndiversity, looks at the kind of representation that is reflected all \nover the United States when it relates to where you are working, how \nyou are working, the type of work you are doing--is it piecework, are \nyou doing it by the amount produced instead of by the hour of work--all \nof that kind of thing works today, and I am not so sure it is not \neffectively distorted by the proposal which is being offered by the \nSenator from Georgia.\n\n  That is why I hope my colleagues would stay with us and stay with \nwhat is in the bill and in the provision that we call AgJOBS, that \nrolls back--on 40,000-plus workers qualified under the H-2A program, \nrolls their wage back to the 2002 level, freezes it for 3 years, while \nthe Department of Labor, working with American agriculture, can get \nthis right because I am convinced that the unintended consequences of \nnow mandating a Federal floor, if you will, to American agriculture is \nnot where we want to go.\n  If we want American agriculture to transition across this chasm, to \nget its workforce legalized, as it wants and as the Senator from \nGeorgia and I want, then we have to make sure the transition which \nallows that to happen effectively uses this tool, the blue card, which \nwill allow that kind of transition to go forward in a way that causes \nus to adjust.\n  We can't take the blue card off the table. I will argue that in the \nend, if the Chambliss amendment passes, we have taken that worker out \nof the workforce. That is not going to be good for American \nagriculture. That is not going to be good for the crops that are \nrotting in the fields today if, by that action, we now have a Federally \nmandated prevailing wage which brings that wage rate up across the \nboard in a way that disallows American agriculture from being \ncompetitive.\n  I believe those are the critical points involved in the difference \nbetween where we are and where we know we need to get. We need to get \nthere in a way that allows the worker to be treated fairly, the \nproducer to be treated fairly, and most importantly that we have an \navailable, legal workforce to meet the needs of American production \nagriculture. That workforce is at risk today, and with the passage of \nthe Chambliss amendment, significantly changing the base rate, it will \nbe at even greater risk as production agriculture looks where it needs \nto farm to be competitive in a world market. It may not be on the soil \nof this great country, and that would be the wrong thing for us, the \nwrong thing for our country, and certainly for our consumers. So I hope \nmy colleagues will look at that and consider it as we deal with this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, my inquiry is, is the Senate under a \nunanimous consent agreement that it would go from one side to the other \nin this debate or is it just jump ball? It is just whoever gets \nrecognized by the Chair to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the arguments \nmade by the Senator from Idaho, but there are a couple of very obvious \nfaults in the argument relative to the wages farmers should pay to the \nfolks who work for them.\n  First of all, the adverse effect wage rate, which is in the current \nlaw and is in the current bill, and is supported by Senator Craig, is \nthe only provision in the labor laws of this land that uses the adverse \neffect wage rate, and we both recognize that this is a flawed system. \nBy his own admission, the Senator from Idaho recognized it, and I \nrecognize it. It is a flawed system because it was never intended to be \nused by the Department of Labor as a means by which wages would be set. \nSo my response to that is, let's take what all other labor laws utilize \nin determining wages, and that is a prevailing wage.\n  You come up with a method whereby the skills that are attached to the \nindividual laborer, the location where that laborer is going to work, \nand the type of job for which that person is to be hired determine how \nmuch that person is going to be paid. What happens now is there is \nsimply a rollback in the current bill of the adverse effect wage rate \nto the year 2002. That is 4 years ago. And by rolling it back 4 years, \nthere is an admission that there is a significant problem there.\n  I don't want to misquote my friend from Idaho, but the other night, \nThursday night, when we were arguing about this on the floor--I might \nadd, in a way that moves both of us to the same conclusion, which is to \nmake sure we provide that quality workforce--the Senator from Idaho \nsaid that at the end of the day, what he wants to get is a prevailing \nwage. I am going to talk about that again in a minute. But if we want \nto get to a prevailing wage, let's get to it now.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I don't think he and I disagree. My concern \nis you are affecting 1.5 million workers by your immediate action, and \nI am affecting 40,000-plus in rolling them back. And we are giving a \nperiod of transition of 3 years to get right what you have proposed. My \nconcern is that in getting right what you proposed, you have an \nimmediate effect on the next phase of agricultural jobs, and that is \nthe transitional period of time in qualifying the blue card worker to \nbecome a permanent worker or a permanent legal worker, and that \nimmediately inflates the wage base. And then immediately upon inflating \nit once, you inflate it again the next year and the next year because \nyou have lifted the base, ratcheted it up by each year's calculation. I \nthink that is a very legitimate concern. So I ask you, is that not the \nimpact of what you do? I am affecting 40,000-plus; you are affecting \n1.5 million.\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I reclaim my time, Mr. President.\n  Here is the deal. The deal today is that a farmer in America, \nwherever he may be, whether he is in Idaho or Georgia, who goes out and \nhires workers to come here legally, pays the adverse effect wage rate. \nIn my State, that happens to be about $8.37 an hour right now. In \naddition to that, they pay for their transportation, they pay for all \ntheir consular fees, they provide housing, so the $8.37 an hour is a \nlittle bit misleading. It is actually more in benefits than that. The \nneighbor next door to that farmer, which is that category of blue card \nworker that you address in your comments, he is paying probably $5.15 \nan hour to that individual. So the farmer who is trying to be legal is \npaying a fair wage rate, or paying a wage rate with benefits that is \nsignificantly different than the gentleman that he is competing with on \nthe farm next door.\n  What the proposed legislation does is continue that difference. It \ntakes those individuals who are here illegally today and says we are \nnot going to guarantee them the adverse effect wage rate or the \nprevailing wage rate. We are going to continue to treat them as a \nsecond class citizen, and we are going to allow farmers who use them to \nhave an advantage over farmers who use legal workers.\n  All my amendment says is that everybody ought to use legal workers. \nWe ought to give farmers across America the opportunity to choose from \na pool of workers to plant, tend, and harvest their crops. During the \nwhole course of the time that they are here in a legal manner, working \nunder that contract, before they have to go home, we want to make sure \nthey are paid a fair wage. That wage is determined as the prevailing \nwage rate by the Department of Labor, and it is based, again, on the \nskill of that worker, on the job for which that worker is hired, and on \nthe wages that are prevailing in the area in which that worker is \nhired. That is exactly what my amendment does.\n  We don't eliminate the blue card. You still have the blue card. The \nfolks who hire blue card workers under the current bill are going to \nhave an advantage over those employers, those farmers who have been \nlegal and utilized H-2A and who want to utilize H-2A in the future.\n  It is a very skewed way of arriving at a wage rate that we both agree \nupon. The question is, How do you get from today, from May 22, 2006, to \na prevailing wage rate?\n  I say let's do it now. What the underlying bill says is let's take \n35,000 or 40,000 workers who are here currently under H-2A, and let's \nallow them get to a prevailing wage rate down the road, within some \ncertain period of time. But let's take this other 1.5 million and let's \nkeep them depressed. Let's let farmers who hire that blue card worker \ncontinue. And it is not going to go away. You better believe they will \nbe here working because they are going to pay them a lower wage rate. \nIt is not fair.\n  My amendment is all about fairness, and it requires farmers to pay a \nreasonable wage rate. They don't mind paying a reasonable wage rate to \nget an honest day's work out of an employee.\n  This amendment is not about numbers either. We had a lot of \ndiscussion the other night about numbers which, frankly, were developed \nby the American Farm Bureau. The American Farm Bureau has access to \nevery farm in America. They have the ability to come up with what are \nthe wage rates that are being paid by every farmer in America. That is \nhow we arrived at our numbers. It is not about how Senator Craig \narrived at his numbers for the adverse effect wage rate. That is not an \nargument on our part. This amendment is simply about fairness.\n  The AgJOBS portion of the underlying bill is simply not fair. It is \nnot fair to the employers across the United States, and it is not fair \nto those who work on our farms--whether they are illegal, whether they \nare in a temporary worker program, a legal permanent resident, or a \nU.S. citizen.\n  Why? Because the underlying bill provides wage guarantees only to \nthose foreign workers who come in under the temporary H-2A program. At \npresent, those workers do number in--I don't know whether it is 35,000 \nto 40,000 or 45,000 to 50,000 this year, but that is the range it will \nbe. The 1.5 million workers who will be legalized under the AgJOBS blue \ncard program do not receive a wage guarantee. This is a tremendous flaw \nin the AgJOBS bill, in my opinion. If these blue card workers are \nwilling to work for $5.15 an hour, then that is all their employers \nhave to pay them. Those folks who are here legally are going to be \nrequired to be paid the adverse effect wage rate, which is \nsignificantly above that minimum wage rate of $5.15.\n  What is ironic to me is that these workers, whether here on a blue \ncard or on a H-2A visa, are essentially the same. Most come from the \nsame country, Mexico; and many from the same villages. Most are here \nbecause of the poverty that exists in their home countries. All are \nhere to earn money to support their families and improve the quality of \ntheir lives.\n  Many will work in the same occupations. Shouldn't they be treated the \nsame? I believe they should. Under the AgJOBS bill, they are not. The \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho might argue that they are different \nand should be treated differently. He does, in a way, say that because \nthose who are legalized with the blue card program will be here \npermanently. However, legalized blue card workers do not have permanent \nstatus. The blue card program simply allows these legal workers to stay \nhere, employed in agriculture, until they meet all the requirements for \nlegal permanent status.\n  No one can calculate how many of these transitional workers will ever \nbecome legal permanent residents. Until they achieve legal permanent \nresident status they should be considered temporary foreign workers and \ntreated similarly.\n  From the employer's side, no difference exists between employers who \nutilize the H-2A program and those who use the blue card program. This \napplies across the board to all commodities produced and livestock \nraised production methods and for their need of dependable workers. \nThere is a major difference though. H-2A workers, many of whom have \nbeen coming to the same employers for years in this country legally--\nthe vast majority did not bring their family members, and they returned \nhome at the end of their periods of employment, just as the law \nrequires.\n  These H-2A workers were not exploited while they were here because \nthe employers played by the rules. Playing by the rules was expensive. \nThe adverse effect wage rate is expensive. But those employers did it \nto their competitive disadvantage with a neighbor who employed illegals \nat a significantly lower rate, who did not pay the transportation costs \nof those workers, and did not provide those workers with housing.\n\n  On the other hand, illegal workers who will benefit from the blue \ncard program broke our laws when they came here, even though they came \nhere for the same reasons as the H-2A worker. The employers who hired \nthem, perhaps some out of absolute necessity--and I understand that--\nbut, by doing that, they also broke our laws. Regardless of the \ncircumstances under which those illegal workers are employed in \nagriculture now, I would be willing to bet that many were exploited, \nunderpaid, and indentured along the way.\n  That is why I do not understand why the underlying bill fails to \nprotect the illegal workers, who adjust their status, and guarantee \nthem a fair wage.\n  I also don't understand why the AgJOBS bill fails to protect U.S. \nworkers who do farm work by neglecting to require employers who use \nforeign labor, whether they access via the H-2A program or the blue \ncard program, to pay all workers in that occupation a prevailing wage.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Inside the AgJOBS Act there is a U.S. labor pool \nestablished. They would pay the going wage. They have to make sure that \npool is exhausted so U.S. citizen agricultural workers are protected. \nYou go there first before you go to hire a blue card worker or a H-2A-\nqualified worker.\n  I hope the Senator understands that they are protected in that sense, \nas it relates to making sure that they are the first in line, if you \nwill, for a job that is available if they would choose to work in that \nfield at the wage that exists at that point.\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I guess the question is, though: How many U.S. workers \nare out there who do take advantage of that now, or would in the \nfuture? I think you and I both know the answer. It is minimal at best.\n  Reclaiming my time--I am about to run out of time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. OK.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. We are going to have our time split at 5:15. \nAgricultural employers who utilize blue card workers must only pay the \nblue card workers the minimum wage and are not required to pay U.S. \nworkers any more than the minimum wage. I think we can agree on that.\n  The H-2A program requires that employers who utilize H-2A pay all \nworkers in the same occupations in which they employ H-2A workers the \nsame wage guaranteed to every other H-2A worker.\n  Throughout this immigration debate we have heard that widespread use \nof foreign workers will depress wages and that employers will reject \nU.S. workers in favor of foreign workers who are willing to work for \nless. In fact, the Senate passed by a voice vote an amendment that was \nput forward by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Obama, \naddressing this very issue.\n  Rather than trying to make the same argument that Senator Obama made, \nI simply want to quote him because it was on the same issue of \nprevailing wage for another program, the H-2C program. Here is what he \nsaid. It was a very good explanation. Senator Obama said that his \namendment essentially says:\n\n       . . . the prevailing wage provisions in the underlying bill \n     should be tightened to ensure that they apply to all workers \n     and not just some workers. The way the underlying bill is \n     currently structured, essentially those workers who fall \n     outside of Davis-Bacon projects or collective bargaining \n     agreements or other provisions are not going to be covered. \n     That could be 25 million workers or so which could be subject \n     to competition from guest workers, even though they are \n     prepared to take the jobs that the employers are offering, if \n     they were offered at a prevailing wage. My hope would be that \n     we can work out whatever disagreements there are on the other \n     side. This is a mechanism to ensure that the guest worker \n     program is not used to undercut American workers and to put \n     downward pressure on the wages of American workers.\n\n  That is exactly what I am saying because, if we have a prevailing \nwage, American workers are going to be more inclined to take those jobs \nrather than blue card workers coming in and being willing to take $5.15 \nan hour. That is exactly what is going to happen if we set the \nprevailing wage, which is where it ought to be, rather than utilizing \nyour blue card program, which is going to wind up in millions, or \nhundreds of thousands of agricultural workers being hired at minimum \nwage.\n  Let me close by saying, here is the reason that the adverse effect \nwage rate is so skewed. This is the chart that shows which States are \nused in calculating the adverse effect wage rate. In my case we use the \nsoutheast region: Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina. A farm worker job, \nor a worker at the State farmers market in Atlanta, GA, is compared to \nthe same agricultural worker at the farmers market in Thomasville, GA. \nThey are 225 miles apart. One is a very urban area, Atlanta, GA. The \nother is a very rural area, Thomasville, GA. It is pretty easy to see \nwhy the Senator from Idaho says this is a skewed way to calculate \nwages. With that we agree.\n  The prevailing wage rate method of calculating wages says individuals \nwho work at the farmers market in Atlanta will be paid a wage \ncomparable to other farm workers in the Atlanta area. That wage earner \nin Thomasville, GA, will receive a wage that is comparable to \nagricultural workers who are paid in the Thomasville, GA, region.\n  I am prepared to yield back, assuming that we have approached the \nhour where we are going to divide these last 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \nshall be equally divided between the Senator from Georgia and the \nSenator from Massachusetts or his designee.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I have had an opportunity to listen to \nthe discussion between Senator Craig and Senator Chambliss on this \nprovision of AgJOBS which we put in as part of the blue card. I \ncongratulate Senator Craig on one of the most colorful charts that we \nhave seen.\n  The labor provision of this bill is a compromise that was negotiated. \nI think it makes sense to leave it that way. It is left that way for 3 \nyears. This has been the subject of long negotiations. After many \nattempts to try to find the right balance, Senators Kennedy and Craig \nstruck an agreement that was supported by both growers and farm workers \nacross this Nation. That is the language in this bill.\n  Under AgJOBS, H-2A workers are paid the greater of the prevailing \nrate or the adverse effect wage rate. As Senator Craig has said, the \nstandard is frozen at 2003, and growers will be required to pay the \nprevailing wage, or what the adverse wage rate was over 3 years ago. \nThe compromise states that this will be the wage rate just for the next \n3 years. And during that time, the GAO and a commission of agricultural \nand labor experts will perform two studies examining H-2A wage rates \nand making recommendations to Congress. If at the end of the 3 years \nCongress fails to enact a new adverse effect wage rate, the adverse \neffect wage rate would be adjusted by the cost of living.\n  While changing AgJOBS isn't, alone, a disqualification, I think we \nhave to be very careful before we upset what has been a very carefully \ncrafted compromise that is supported by a broad coalition of Members \nfrom all sides of the debate.\n  If I might, I would like to ask Senator Craig a question. Since he \nwas the one who negotiated this, is it not true that this is a broadly \nagreed upon solution for both farm workers as well as growers?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe it is fair and balanced. The reason it is is \nbecause we pushed a wage scale that is already there back 3 years. We \ndo it this time to get right what the Senator from Georgia has \nproposed. He has shown the disparity that already exists out there--and \nit exists in all formulations when it relates to agriculture and \nagricultural jobs. We have never focused on agriculture except in the \nH-2A area. We believe it did get out of line, and that is why it is \nshoved back. Then we proceed, just as the Senator mentioned, in a \nmethodical way to examine the country and get the wage scale rate \nright.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Is it not true that when I introduced the blue card \nprogram in the Judiciary Committee I just took that part of the H-2A \nprogram which the Senator and Senator Kennedy had put together in the \nAgJOBS bill?\n  Mr. CRAIG. That is correct.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This has been a longstanding compromise that has been \nout there, which is a negotiated compromise.\n  If I might ask one other question, in the negotiations that the \nSenator had on AgJOBS, how long did it take to come up with this \nnegotiated compromise?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Frankly, the adverse wage issue was one of the more \ncontentious, for a variety of reasons--first of all, because producers \nsaw it as being complicated with a lot of requirements other than just \na wage, and obviously employment saw it as an advantage but limited. As \na result, we were able to agree to shove it back.\n  As I say, that rarely happens in American history, to actually by law \npush the wage scale back but to do so with the understanding that we \nwould get equity and fairness through the approach that the Senator has \noutlined. That was the approach we used. A coalition of well over 500, \nincluding agriculture, a lot of agricultural producers.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How long has this agreement been in place?\n  Mr. CRAIG. About 3 years--2\\1/2\\ years, actually, as we formulated \nit.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. My time has expired.\n  I urge the Senate to vote no on the Chambliss amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The Senator from California was not involved in those negotiations, \nand I chair the Agriculture Committee. I do not know how to respond to \nthat other than by saying that certain segments of agriculture were \ninvolved in the negotiations, I assume. My dear friend from \nMassachusetts was involved, and I daresay that I have more farmers in\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\nmy home county than we have in the vast majority of Massachusetts.\n  My point is not that these discussions did not take place over a long \nperiod of time between farmers--I don't know who they were. But I can \ntell you this: The American Farm Bureau has looked at the AgJOBS \nprovision. They have looked at my amendment. They have looked at the \nbill that I submitted which was somewhat contrary to AgJOBS. The \nAmerican Farm Bureau--which, as I said earlier, has access to virtually \nevery farm in America, particularly from the standpoint of the \ncalculation of wages--has concluded that my amendment is fair and \nreasonable. And the American Farm Bureau is recommending a ``yes'' vote \non the Chambliss amendment.\n  To say that this has been discussed over a period of time by a group, \nor a large group--whatever the term was--of farmers across America, my \nfarmers were not involved in those negotiations. Senator Craig and I \nhave had any number of conversations about the bill and about our \nvarious amendments. But we were not involved in those negotiations.\n  I see my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He comes from the Farm \nBelt of America. I daresay that his farmers were not involved in those \nnegotiations. Let us be very clear about this. There was not a \ndiscussion or a negotiation by America's farmers for what they thought \nwas best.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I can speak for California, and California's Farm \nBureau has signed off on this. I can tell the Senator that no State has \nas many farmers and growers as California does. This is the accepted \nagreement.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from California for her comments, \nand I tell her that I dialog with many farmers in her State on a \nregular basis, particularly as chairman of the Agriculture Committee. I \nam hearing from a large number of her farmers in strong support of my \namendment.\n  Again, when you say that a majority number of farmers in America \nthink this is the way to go, you can't say that. That is simply not \nright. There are only--by Senator Craig's numbers--less than 50,000 \nfarmers in America--and I happen to agree with him on this--who \ncurrently utilize H-2A. I daresay the rest of the farmers in America \ndon't even know what ``adverse effect wage rate'' means. But I can tell \nyou they know what ``prevailing wage rate'' means. They know when they \nhire a tractor driver in the southwest part of Texas what their \nneighbors are paying for a tractor driver. And that is how you \ncalculate a prevailing wage. That is not how adverse effect wage rate \nsays you will pay that tractor driver.\n  Whether farmers in California or farmers in Georgia or the northeast \npart of our country, the market should dictate, and the market dictates \nunder the prevailing wage rate. It simply does not dictate under the \nadverse effect wage rate.\n  That is why, in the Senator's bill, the adverse effect wage rate is \nrolled back 4 years. There is a flaw in the way the wage rate is \ncalculated. If you are going to roll back the wage rate, which is \nactually going to move toward the utilization of the prevailing wage \nrate, let's do it now. Let's require that all farmers in America pay a \nreasonable wage rate for their employees based upon what other farmers \nin that region pay for employees.\n  For example, I know in northern California there are different crops \ngrown than in southern California. There are different types of jobs. \nBut today, under the AgJOBS bill, a farmer in northern California will \npay exactly the same wage rate as a farmer in southern California.\n  Here is the chart. This shows how wage rates under this bill are \ncalculated. They use the entire State of California. It is a different \ntype of farming. There is a different skill required in northern \nCalifornia than there is in southern California. There is a different \nskill required in a tractor driver versus somebody who goes into the \nfield and cuts lettuce or cuts cabbage or cuts squash or whatever it \nmay be.\n  Under the adverse effect wage rate in the base AgJOBS bill, that is \nnot taken into consideration. Under the prevailing wage under my \namendment, it is taken into consideration.\n  If anyone says it is difficult to determine, how do I know in my \nexample of Thomasville, GA, what it takes to hire that worker? Let me \ntell you what you have to do. You simply have to go to the computer and \nplug into a Web site, the Department of Labor. And you designate the \narea. You put into the computer where you are located, what the job is, \nand the computer immediately gives you what the Department of Labor has \ndetermined to be a prevailing wage. It is very simple and very easy. It \nensures that one farmer next door to another farmer is paying employees \nthe same wage rate. You don't have a farmer who is paying $8.37 \ncurrently required by the adverse effect wage rate and the farmer next \ndoor paying $5.15 an hour for the same job.\n  This is about fairness. It is about equity. It is about ensuring that \nfarm workers who come here under the base bill, which I, frankly, don't \nagree with, but if we are going to pass this, then let us be fair to \nthose employees who come here and work in agriculture. Let us pay them \nthe rate that is prevailing in the area in which they work.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, standing in opposition to the amendment, it \nis fascinating to me that we now want to play a game of what groups and \nwhose associations. I find it fascinating that the California Farm \nBureau, which supports the position, isn't quite good enough. The \nCalifornia Apple Commission, the California Avocado Commission, the \nCalifornia Association of Nurseries and Garden Centers, the California \nAssociation of Wine Grape Growers, the California Canners and Peach \nAssociation, the California Citrus Mutual--we have nearly 500 groups \nthat have endorsed this.\n  The reason they have endorsed it is because they see the need to do \nit right and get a reasonable transition.\n  The Web site the Senator from Georgia is talking about has to be \nright. It has to be effective and reflective. It doesn't do that today. \nThat information is now not available in that context.\n  Let me go back to the transition. We are talking about those who are \nillegal today and wanting them to come forward, get a background check, \nshow us their credentials, qualify for a transitional status, called \nearned adjustment status, and a blue card, and to do so in a fair and \nresponsible fashion.\n  They can stay and continue to work. While they are doing that, we are \ngoing to work to get the wage scale right. In our work over the last \ngood number of years, literally hundreds and hundreds of agricultural \ngroups and associations have stepped forward and said: Help us fix \nthis. Help us use this blue card to get across, in a transitional way, \nfor a legal workforce, in a reformed H-2A program. The compromise that \nthe Senator from California talked about was just that. It was a \ntransitional wage to get this fair and equitable.\n  What the Senator from Georgia is doing is not affecting the 40,000-\nplus of H-2A under adverse wage. We are doing that. We are shoving \nthose wages back. He is affecting the 1.5 million that may cause \nagriculture to become noncompetitive if we don't get the wage scale \nrate right and involve agriculture along with the Department of Labor, \nas our studies would do, to make sure we get an equitable and fair \nwage. Fair means two sides. For the worker, it means certainty; for the \nproducer, absolutely, the product that is produced--especially in the \nvegetable crops, in the intensified labor crops--has got to be \ncompetitive against a world market crop, or we will shove those \nproducers and that kind of production out of the country.\n\n  We have to do it in a balanced way. What we have offered allows the \nSenator from Georgia, as the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, to \nparticipate. He did not participate in these negotiations because he \ndid not agree with them. He did not agree with the transition of \ngetting through what we attempted to do in AgJOBS. That was his choice. \nIn the end, both he and I agreed on many of the provisions except this \none. It is important we stay with the work product.\n  Literally hundreds and hundreds of farm groups and associations \nacross\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\nthe Nation that deal with this type of workforce recognize the need of \nthe transitional period of time and the legality of the workforce, as \ndo we. It is reflected in the bill. I hope our colleagues continue to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act \nincludes a subtitle known as AgJOBS, a bill that has long been \nchampioned by Senator Craig, Senator Kennedy, and a broad bipartisan \ngroup of Senators. I strongly support this bill because it will help \nboth farmers and farm workers in Vermont and around the Nation.\n  AgJOBS contains a package of reforms that are badly needed in the \nseasonal agricultural worker program, called H-2A visas. AgJOBS was \nnegotiated with the full participation of agribusiness and farmworkers' \nunions, and it reflects a fair and thoughtful balance of the needs of \nboth farmers and workers.\n  The version of AgJOBS contained in S. 2611 protects business by \nensuring a steady flow of legal workers. It assists agricultural \nworkers by preventing wage stagnation in a growing economy and by \nproviding labor protections. It helps both business and labor by giving \ntrained and trusted foreign agricultural workers a path to permanent \nimmigration status if they meet the requirements in the bill, such as \npaying fines and taxes, keeping a clean criminal record, and working \nthe requisite number of hours.\n  The Chambliss amendment is an attack on wages for agricultural \nworkers who are among the lowest paid laborers in America. By unfairly \nfavoring the growers over foreign workers, the Chambliss amendment \nwould upset the careful balance on wages and labor protections that \nwere negotiated with the participation of agribusiness and unions in \nthe AgJOBS bill.\n  The Chambliss amendment requires employers to pay workers the highest \nof two wage rates: the prevailing wage in the area of employment, which \nmay be determined by an employer who conducts his own local survey, or \nthe applicable State minimum wage. Basing wages on the higher of these \ntwo rates could result in deep cuts to wages. Some State minimum wages \nare very low, such as Kansas, which requires only $2.65 per hour. \nSenator Chambliss previously acknowledged that farm wages could fall by \nroughly $3 per hour under his proposal. His proposal almost guarantees \nthat no U.S. workers could afford to accept agricultural jobs and that \nforeign agricultural workers, who are already among the most poorly \npaid workers in America, would be paid miserly wages for their labor.\n  The Chambliss formulation does not include the well-balanced \nprovisions of AgJOBS. Under AgJOBS, an employer must pay the highest of \nthree wage rates: (1) the prevailing wage, (2) the Federal or State \nminimum wage, (3) or the ``adverse effect wage rate,'' or AEWR, a \nregional weighted average hourly wage rate for agricultural workers. \nThe AEWR was established under the Bracero guest worker program for \nMexican workers that ended in the 1960s. It was created to ensure that \nguest workers would not adversely affect American workers by depressing \nwages. Removing AEWR from the wage equation drives wages downward, \nwhich hurts all workers--American and foreign. It is no secret that our \nagricultural industries depend on cheap labor, and some estimate that \n70 percent of agricultural workers presently working in the U.S. are \nundocumented. For all the of national security reasons I have cited \nthroughout this debate, we need to bring agricultural workers out of \nthe shadows. But we must also recognize that vulnerable populations \ndeserve our support and protection. Farm workers are among the most \nvulnerable laborers in the Nation and I cannot support an amendment \nthat would slash their wages further.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 7\\1/2\\ minutes. \nThe Senator from Massachusetts has 6\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thought there were certain values in \nthis Senate upon which we could agree. If you work hard in this \ncountry, you shouldn't live a life of poverty. We have been trying to \nraise the minimum wage--which is $5.15 an hour--trying to raise that \nfor over 9 years, and our Republican friends, including the Senator \nfrom Georgia, have been opposed to it.\n  Look what this bill does. The current farm wage is $10.11; for an \nagricultural job, it is $7.86; and the Chambliss amendment is below the \nminimum wage. Not only is it below the minimum wage, but he \nspecifically writes in his amendment that it will be below the minimum \nwage and State minimum wages will apply when they apply. But Georgia \ndoes not have a State minimum wage.\n  I don't know what the Senator from Georgia has against someone \nworking for $7.86 an hour. The cost of gas has gone through the roof. \nThe cost of food has gone through the roof. A gallon of milk is $3.09 a \ngallon; eggs, $1.39; a loaf of bread is $3.29; a pound of hamburger is \n$3.99. And the Senator from Georgia, if we follow his suggestion, is \ndriving wages down, not up.\n  This is $7.86 an hour to try to get along. What we are trying to do \nis reduce the disparity. The Senator from Georgia said we were not \ninvolved in this. Well, we have 400 different organizations indicating \nto the Senate their support. We have broad support. More than 60 \nMembers, Republicans and Democrats, cosponsored it, to bring it up to \n$7.86. But no, the Senator from Georgia wants this down to what some \npeople have said is paid to pieceworkers, $3 or $4 an hour. Three or \nfour dollars an hour? We might not have many farmers in Massachusetts, \nbut whoever we have in Massachusetts understands below poverty wages, \nand $3 or $4 an hour for piecework is a poverty wage. It is wrong.\n  If it is so troublesome that they are going to get paid $7.86, if \nMembers are so worked up about that, if Members think that is too much \nfor someone who works hard, for someone who does some of the most \ndifficult work in this country, go ahead and vote for the Chambliss \namendment.\n  Mr. President, $7.86, when these workers have to pay $3 to get a \ngallon of gasoline? Talk about fairness. I listen to the Senator from \nGeorgia. Let's talk about fairness. Let's talk about equity. Let's talk \nabout treating everyone the same. They will be treated the same, but \nthey will be treated mighty shabbily. This is a question of respect for \nthose workers. Do you respect them in the United States, these hard-\nworking people? Finally, about 20 percent of agricultural workers are \nAmericans. You will depress their wages, too? Evidently. I hope we are \nnot going to be about that at this time in this debate and discussion.\n  I noticed that on page 2, the Senator talks about the prevailing \nwage, the occupation, and the applicable State minimum wage. Is there a \nState minimum wage in Georgia, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. The minimum wage in Georgia is $5.15 an hour.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. In agriculture?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The State minimum wage in agriculture is $5.15 an hour. \nAm I right that there is no way that even those who are picking per \nbushel would go below $5.15 an hour?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. What happens is these wage earners in the fields in \nGeorgia and all over the country go out and they take a bucket out into \nthe field. They cut squash, cucumbers, or they cut whatever the crop \nmay be, they put it in that bucket, they dump that bucket in a bin, and \nthey are given a chip. At the end of the day, those chips add up to \ndollars. They are required to be paid the minimum of either the minimum \nwage or, in this case, the adverse effect wage rate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand I may be wrong, and I wish the Senator from \nGeorgia would correct me, the State minimum wage does not apply to \nagricultural workers. That is my understanding. If I am wrong, I hope \nthe Senator will correct me. My understanding is the State minimum wage \ndoes not apply to agricultural workers.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Georgia, my \ncolleague, Senator Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Let me respond to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\n  Something he said--I am sure unintentionally--was very incorrect. He \nsaid we are going to force people, by what the Senator is trying to do, \nto earn less than the minimum wage. What we are, in fact, trying to do \nis to ensure that those who are working in the fields, who are illegal \nand are being abused and are not being paid the adverse effect wage \nrate, prevailing rate, or anything else, all those--maybe 1.8 million--\nwill now get a pay raise under what the Senator is trying to do. He is \nsaying they will be paid the higher of the minimum wage or the \nprevailing wage.\n  I ran for the Senate in the years 2003 and 2004. Although I worked \nfarms in the 1950s, I had not been on a farm in a long time, and I \nspent a lot of time in south Georgia, slept in a lot of barns on farms. \nI got to know the onion folks, the peanut folks, and the row crops.\n  I spent the night in a farmer's barn--a mighty nice barn, I might \nadd, with a nice double bed--I spent the night in the barn, and he \ncomplained about what happened. He hired H-2A workers, as he \nshould, legal workers. According to the law, he paid them the adverse \neffect wage rate, and the farmer down the road from him hired illegals \nand paid them the minimum. They got away with paying much less for \npicking the same crop he was because he was obeying the law.\n\n  The circumstances the Senator has right now in the United States of \nAmerica are the following: The unintended consequence of the adverse \neffect wage rate is that you are driving farmers to hire illegally \nrather than hire legally and pay them at adverse effect wage rates. \nThat is what the Senator is trying to correct.\n  But it is absolutely incorrect to allege or to say that the bill of \nthe Senator from Georgia, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, \nwould force people to be paid below the minimum wage. It will, in fact, \nensure that workers will be paid the higher of the minimum wage or the \nprevailing wage; is that not correct?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. That is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Facts are stubborn things. We can argue about a lot of \nthings, but treating people right is something Senator Chambliss has \nbeen doing in Georgia, what I have grown up in Georgia doing, and I am \nsure what the Senator from Massachusetts does. The argument here is \nabout repealing a law that has the unintended consequence of making it \nattractive to hire illegal aliens to work. What this bill is supposed \nto be doing is fostering legal immigration and equitable treatment for \nall.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Georgia. I commend the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee. I pledge my support to this \namendment and congratulate him on this effort.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 34 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield a minute to the Senator from Idaho. I will \nreserve 34 seconds for myself.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as of April of 2006, the average \nfieldworker in the United States was paid $8.96 an hour. The average \nlivestock worker was paid $9.30 an hour. The minimum wage is $5.15. Do \nthe math. That is why, when we put this bill together, we said we have \nto get it right for all parties involved.\n  I agree with the Senator from Georgia, producers are willing to pay a \nfair wage. And they should. And workers who work as hard as \nagricultural workers ought to be paid a fair and good wage. At the same \ntime, we compete in a world market, and I hope we stay there.\n  I don't think you can meet with one farm organization and establish \nwhat the prevailing wage is going to be. That is why we mandated in our \nbill that the Department of Labor work with agriculture to get it right \nbecause we conclude that the H-2A adverse effect wage rate got out of \nline. I don't know what the right wage is. I wager that the Senator \nfrom Georgia probably doesn't know where it ought to be, either, in \nevery segment of agriculture in our country.\n  I wish the Senators would stay with the bill and vote down the \nChambliss amendment because in the end we want to get it right for all \ninvolved. We want to keep American agriculture competitive in a world \nmarket.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, no matter how you slice it, this is a \nmajor cut for workers with the Chambliss amendment, No. 1.\n  No. 2, we are trying to remedy the situation between documented and \nundocumented workers. We hear we have to do this because we are forced \nto have illegal workers. We are changing all of that. We are putting in \nplace a system so we will have verification.\n  We do believe this figure, the $7.86, for workers who work hard, play \nby the rules, and are trying to provide for their families, is not \nunfair, at a minimum. That is why I hope the Chambliss amendment will \nbe defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I simply say to my friend from \nMassachusetts, I hear what the Senator is saying relative to the \nnumbers the Senator just addressed, but here is what you are doing. You \nare taking 40,000 agricultural employees who now operate under H-2A and \nyou are reducing their wages immediately. The chart Senator Craig had \nup here Thursday night showed what the numbers are. I don't remember \nwhat they are, but it is a significant reduction because you are \nrolling that wage back to what it was 4 years ago. Now, that is 40,000 \nagricultural workers.\n  Here is what you are doing to 1.5 million agricultural workers under \nyour bill. You are going to allow farmers across America who do not \nparticipate in H-2A to pay those blue card workers $5.15 an hour. We \ncan argue whether minimum wage is high enough, whether it ought to be \nmore, but that is the effect of what you are doing with your blue card \nworkers. So if the $7 number is good enough for H-2A or not good enough \nfor H-2A, whatever it is, it ought to be good for those 1.5 million \nworkers who will have a blue card. That is what fairness in my \namendment is all about.\n  When Senator Craig says let's get it right, let's do get it right. We \nagree the adverse effect wage rate is wrong. There is no disagreement \nabout that. The question is, How do we correct it? How do we get to the \npoint where it is fair? The way we get to the point where it is fair is \nwe take the same method of calculation we do under every other labor \nbill, including the one we just passed last week, the H-2C bill that \nSenator Obama said: Let's put a prevailing wage rate on H-2C. I say \nlet's put a prevailing wage rate on H-2A.\n  We understand we are not the ones to calculate that. It is calculated \nby the Department of Labor. It is calculated by the Department of Labor \nbased upon the fair and accurate wages paid to individuals in different \nparts of the country who perform different jobs within agriculture. It \nis very easy to ascertain by the farmer what that wage rate ought to \nbe.\n  It will remove the ability of the next door neighbor to come in and \nundercut that farmer, whether he is a blue card worker or whether they \ncontinue to be here illegally. It will depress the wages for those \nfarmers rather than raising the standard for all workers to be paid a \nfair wage. It will encourage farmers--this is what we want to do--to \nparticipate in the H-2A program. If we had every farmer in America \ndoing that, they would have a quality supply of labor from which to \nchoose. They would have to pay those workers a reasonable rate, and \nAmerica would never be in a position of being dependent upon foreign \nimports for our food supply.\n  We cannot afford to get there. This is a national security issue. We \nneed to make sure farmers have those workers from whom to choose to \nmake sure their crops are harvested.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, very briefly, to inform my colleagues, \nthis amendment is basically the President's proposal to use the \nNational Guard to secure our borders as an interim step as we are \nadding to our Border Patrol agents on our southern border.\n  We all know we cannot have a commonsense, comprehensive immigration \npolicy without having secure borders. It is going to take us years to \nget enough Border Patrol agents down there. In the meantime, we need to \nhave the National Guard to supplement and to multiply the force of the \nBorder Patrol agents down there. That is what this amendment does. I \nbelieve it is an important step toward making sure we know who is \ncoming into this country, making sure terrorists are not coming into \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, the Ensign amendment would codify the President's \nproposal to deploy the National Guard to the border. The President's \nproposal strikes a careful balance.\n  Over the next year, they would send up to 6,000 guardsmen. The \nfollowing year, they would decrease this to a maximum of 3,000 \nguardsmen. As the guardsmen stand down, the Border Patrol would stand \nup, and in the end, we would have 6,000 more Border Patrolmen securing \nthe border.\n  I remain concerned about the strain on the Guard. It is reassuring \nthat the deployment will be limited in number and duration. I hope the \nadministration will work closely with the Pentagon to ensure that we \nare not putting greater strain on those specialties that are needed in \nIraq and Afghanistan.\n  Also, I applaud the President's decision to use the Guard in a \nsupporting role and not for direct law enforcement missions. The Guard \nis not trained for the civilian Border Patrol missions and its complex \ncombination of law enforcement, civil rights, and human rights issues. \nNor should we ask them to be, for this is not their mission. They \nshould provide support to the Border Patrol.\n  We must also ensure that any Guard activity is coordinated with the \nGovernors. I agree with the border State Governors that securing our \nborders, particularly for the long term, is a law enforcement function. \nWe should not militarize the borders. And, in the short term, we should \nrespect the desires of the border State Governors regarding the \nutilization of the Guard along the border.\n  I urge that my colleagues support this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to add my support to this very \nimportant amendment offered by my good friend and colleague from \nNevada, Senator Ensign.\n  Last Monday evening, a week ago, the President addressed this Nation, \nforcefully and articulately making the case that one of the necessary \nsteps in undertaking comprehensive immigration reform is to secure our \nnational borders, particularly along our Southwestern States.\n  Following the President's speech by little more than a day, the Armed \nServices Committee held a hearing during which we closely questioned \nsenior members of the Department of Defense, Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nChief of the Border Patrol, and the Chief of National Guard Bureau on \nthe President's plan.\n  I strongly support the President's plan, and, on the basis of our \nhearing and subsequent discussions, I strongly believe that the \nNational Guard is capable of providing this temporary support to the \nBureau of Customs and Border Protection without degrading either its \nreadiness for combat or its ability to respond to domestic emergencies.\n  I also believe that this amendment is important to show that the \nCongress is behind this effort to secure our borders as part of \ncomprehensive immigration reform, and that we will provide the \nresources and legislation to do so. This amendment provides specific \nauthority for deployment of the National Guard, and does so in a way \nthat is careful to authorize both the types of activities, the duration \nof the training rotations, a limit on the authority to use the Guard \nfor direct participation in law enforcement consistent with the \nPresident's intent, and a sunset date for the authority.\n  I commend my colleague from Nevada, who serves with me on the Armed \nServices Committee, for this important amendment that puts the full \nforce of Congress behind the President's initiative to secure our \nborders and support our Border Patrol with the National Guard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I intend to vote in favor of the Ensign \namendment to authorize the National Guard to assist in securing the \nsouthern border of the United States. The National Guard has been used \nin a State status to perform Federal missions in the past--for \ncounterdrug and counterterrorism missions--but Congress provided \nexpress statutory authorization for these efforts.\n  I believe that it is essential that we provide a similar statutory \nauthorization here. This authorization gives Congress an appropriate \nopportunity to define the circumstances in which it is appropriate to \nprovide Federal reimbursement for the National Guard in State status \nand the types of activities for which Federal reimbursement will be \nprovided.\n  The key to the Ensign amendment, in my view, is that it makes it \nclear that the National Guard of a State will perform this mission only \nif ordered by the Governor of the State to do so. This provision makes \nit clear that the Governors retain control of the National Guard when \nit acts in a State\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\nstatus. For these reasons, I support the Ensign amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on an amendment to \nauthorize the use of the National Guard along the Southwest border of \nthe United States. Last week, in hearings before the Appropriations \nCommittee and the Armed Services Committee, I asked senior \nadministration officials from the Department of Defense, the Border \nPatrol, the National Guard Bureau, and other military leaders about my \nconcerns that this mission would detract from the ability of the \nNational Guard to respond to emergencies in their home States.\n  Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Chief of the National Guard \nBureau General Steven Blum, and other witnesses gave their assurances \nthat this plan to deploy troops to the border would not create a new, \nstrenuous deployment of the Guard, it would not leave our States in a \nbind should a disaster strike while troops were on deployment, and it \nwould allow Governors to make the final call as to whether National \nGuard units from their States should be used in support of the Border \nPatrol. Those witnesses also testified that National Guard units would \nonly be used in missions and roles for which the troops are already \ntrained.\n  I expect the administration to hold firm to these assurances, and the \namendment before the Senate would help to limit the scope of the \nmissions for which the Guard may be deployed.\n  While I still have questions about how the National Guard will carry \nout the missions that are assigned to it, we must not overlook the fact \nthat the administration has missed many opportunities to tighten \ncontrols at our borders without depending on our citizen-soldiers to do \nthe job. Since September 11, I have offered nine amendments to provide \nmore funds to hire more Border Patrol agents, strengthen security at \nour borders, and stop the flow of illegal immigrants and contraband \ninto our country. The administration opposed each one of my amendments, \nlabeling them to be ``extraneous,'' ``unnecessary'' spending that would \n``expand the size of government.'' If my amendments had been approved \nand supported by the administration, there would be thousands more \nBorder Patrol agents on the job today.\n  Real homeland security cannot be found in a patchwork of quick fixes. \nSending troops to the border is at best a Band-Aid solution to a \nserious problem. I will support this amendment, but I will also \ncontinue my efforts to provide the funds that are needed to provide \nlasting improvements to our border security.\n\n\n                action consistent with president's plan\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Bush administration has announced a \nplan that includes the use of National Guard forces to temporarily \nsupport Federal border patrol operations. While I support additional \nefforts to secure our borders, it is disappointing that nearly 5 years \nafter the attacks of September 11, 2001, there are still insufficient \nU.S. Border Patrol personnel to adequately maintain the southern land \nborder.\n  I appreciate the efforts by the Senator from Nevada to clarify the \nrole of the National Guard in implementing the President's plan to \nsecure the border. It is my understanding that the National Guard is \nbeing utilized under title 32 of the United States Code, which means \nthat command and control rains with the Governor and the State or \nterritorial government even though the Guard forces are being employed \nin the service of the United States for a Federal purpose. I also \nunderstand that under title 32, the Federal Government will reimburse \nStates for costs, including the logistical costs, incurred during the \nmission. Finally, I understand that the National Guard will not \ndirectly participate in any law enforcement function, including search, \nseizure, arrest or similar activity.\n  Does the Senator from Massachusetts share my understanding that the \nEnsign amendment is consistent with the President's plan?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the following \nletter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 18, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: We the undersigned write to strongly oppose \n     the Chambliss amendments aimed at gutting the ``AgJOBS'' \n     compromise contained in the Hagel-Martinez bill before the \n     Senate. The AgJOBS language is the product of the hard work \n     of Senators Craig, Feinstein and Kennedy in collaboration \n     with agribusiness employers, farmworker organizations, and a \n     bipartisan group of Members of the House. We strongly support \n     these needed reforms for the agricultural industry and its \n     workers and we oppose changes that would turn this balanced \n     package into a Bracero program.\n       In particular, we oppose the Chambliss amendment to lower \n     the wages for farmworkers. Amendment 4009 would change the \n     AgJOBS compromise on wage rates and slash the H-2A program's \n     already inadequate wage rates by eliminating the protection \n     of the adverse effect wage rate and the federal minimum wage \n     from H-2A workers.\n       Currently, H-2A employers must pay the highest of three \n     wage rates--the state or federal minimum wage, the ``Adverse \n     Effect Wage Rate'' (AEWR), or the local prevailing wage. The \n     AEWR was created under the Bracero guestworker program as a \n     necessary protection against depression in prevailing wages \n     (wage rates often stagnate because the guestworkers have \n     little ability to demand higher wages). Sen. Chambliss \n     himself described the effect of his provision as cutting H-2A \n     program wage rates by roughly $3.00 per hour!!\n       The AGJOBS compromise already addresses the H-2A wage \n     issue. AgJOBS would reduce the adverse effect wage rates for \n     each state by about 10% by setting them at the rates in \n     effect on January 1, 2003, and would then freeze the AEWR's \n     for three years, while two studies are performed to examine \n     H-2A wage rates and make recommendations to Congress. If \n     Congress were to fail to enact an adverse effect wage rate \n     formula within 3 years, the AEWRs would be adjusted at the \n     end of 3 years by the cost of living. The AEWR issue is a \n     complex one and is best left to the studies agreed to in the \n     AgJOBS compromise.\n       Congress should not approve amendments that will encourage \n     the agricultural industry to hire guestworkers at depressed \n     wages--and that is exactly what the Chambliss amendments \n     would do. This will harm both foreign workers and U.S. \n     workers)and the effort should be opposed.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Federal of Labor-Congress of Industrial \n     Organizations (AFL-CIO); American Federation of State County \n     and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); Catholic Charities USA; \n     Change to Win; Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; \n     Farmworker Justice; Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS); \n     International Brotherhood of Teamsters; The International \n     Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural \n     Implement Workers of America (UAW); Laborers' International \n     Union of North America; League of United Latin American \n     Citizens (LULAC); Mexican American Legal Defense and \n     Educational Fund (MALDEF); National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR); National Farm Worker Ministry; National Immigration \n     Forum; National Immigration Law Center; Service Employees \n     International Union (SEIU); UNITE HERE; United Farm Workers \n     of America (UFW); United Food and Commercial Workers \n     International Union (UFCW).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I believe most of us strongly support \ndeploying the National Guard to our borders. I appreciate very much the \nsentiment and the direction this amendment goes. Unfortunately, it \nlimits their ability and puts limitations on the time and on the \nmission the Guard provides. When you are sending troops into a \ndifficult assignment, whether it is war or not, we should not be saying \nthe Guard can only stay so long, the Guard can only do this or the \nGuard can only do that.\n  The President has outlined how he wishes to use the Guard. I support \nthat. I believe it is a bad idea for Congress to say how we should be \nusing our troops, whether it is in national security or homeland \ndefense. Therefore, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support what the Senator \nfrom Missouri has said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n30 seconds to respond.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bond also have an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, briefly, regarding the limitations the \nSenator from Missouri has brought up, a third of the forces the \nPresident has envisioned would not have any limitations. Two-thirds \nwould basically be on their annual missions of 21 days, and they are \nspecifically for the perception that they are there for police \nenforcement and are doing what the Border Patrol agents do. We put in \nthe bill specifically what they would be doing.\n  There is all the flexibility in the world for the Guard to do the \nmission they are being sent down there to do. I think the concerns \nbeing raised are unfounded.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the effort the Senator from \nNevada is making. The problem is, some on the training missions may \nhave to spend longer than that. They may want to spend longer than \nthat. It may have the effect of having a different percentage of the \nGuard used for more than 15 days. It specifies limits on it.\n  I believe that while we support the general purpose of using the \nGuard, Congress should not be putting limitations on how it is used. I \ndisagree with my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Nevada. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators were necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), \nand the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Sununu).\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), \nthe Senator from Minnesota (Mr. Dayton), the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Menendez), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) \nare necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nDelaware (Mr. Biden) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 83, nays 10, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 137 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--83\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--10\n\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Cochran\n     Conrad\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Jeffords\n     Leahy\n     Stevens\n     Voinovich\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Biden\n     Dayton\n     Enzi\n     McCain\n     Menendez\n     Rockefeller\n     Sununu\n  The amendment (No. 4576), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes the bill tomorrow morning, there be 60 minutes for the \nFeinstein amendment, with Senator Feinstein in control of 30 minutes, \n20 minutes to the chairman, and 10 minutes for the ranking member; \nprovided further that on the expiration of that debate, the Senate \nproceed to a vote on the Feinstein amendment No. 4087, with no \nintervening action or debate or second-degree amendments. We will vote \non the Feinstein amendment at 10:45 a.m. tomorrow, since the Senate \nwill be coming in at 9:45 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto ask of the chairman of the committee, Senator Cantwell and I have an \namendment that has been pending. We were willing to move forward last \nweek, we were willing to move forward today, and we are willing to move \nforward tomorrow. I am wondering if the chairman can give us a sense of \nwhen our amendment can be brought up so we can be heard and whether we \ncan get a commitment from the chairman that we will have a reasonable \namount of time, if not an excessive amount of time to debate it--say, \nan hour or 2 hours.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my sense is we will be able to reach it \ntomorrow. We are juggling a great many considerations. I had discussed \nthe issue with the Senator from New Hampshire earlier. We talked about \n1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. That would be fine with me if the other side is agreeable \nto that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That would be my proposal when we come to it. I know the \nSenator from New Hampshire is waiting, and he is entitled to have his \namendment heard. We will try to get to it tomorrow, and we will try to \nwork out a time agreement of 1 hour equally divided.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the chairman making that representation. My \nconcern, of course, is that it not end up in a vote-arama, should we \nget to a vote-arama, and that we have time to debate it. With that \nrepresentation, I will not object.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do not expect vote-arama on this bill. \nThis is not the budget resolution. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nfamiliar with budget resolutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4087\n\n     (Purpose: To modify the conditions under which aliens who are \n   unlawfully present in the United States are granted legal status)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4087.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself \n     and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 4087.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this is an amendment to modify the \nconditions under which aliens who are lawfully present in the United \nStates are granted legal status. It is submitted on behalf of Senator \nHarkin and myself. We have a half hour to argue the amendment tomorrow, \nbut I would like to just raise a few points about it tonight. I did \nhave the opportunity to speak about it earlier, but I recognize many \nMembers were not yet back and available.\n  This amendment creates an orange card, a replica of which is on my \nleft. This would streamline the process for earned legalization. It \nwould create a more workable and practical program than exists in the \nHagel-Martinez compromise, and it would dedicate the necessary dollars \nto cover the costs of administering this program. This amendment builds \non compromises already agreed to under the McCain-Kennedy and Hagel-\nMartinez proposals, and it incorporates the amendments already adopted \non the floor, but it eliminates what I consider to be a very unworkable \nthree-tier program. This amendment only deals with the earned \nlegalization parts of the bill. It does not change any of the border \nsecurity provisions, the guest worker program, or any other component \nof the bill. It would simply eliminate the program created by Hagel-\nMartinez and replace it with this orange card program.\n\n  Under Hagel-Martinez, there are three tiers. Now, note this: We have \nnot voted on Hagel-Martinez. Hagel-Martinez was an arrangement put \ntogether by Members of this body and it was brought up by using rule \nXIV. We have not voted on it. It essentially takes the 11.1 million \npeople now in this country--working in this country, living in this \ncountry, raising their families in this country, but doing so in a \nclandestine way--and divides them into three different categories. For \nthe 6.7 million who have been here more than 5 years, it would provide \na transition to achieve earned legalization. For the 1.6 million who \nhave been here less than 2 years or the 2.8 million who\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nhave been here from 2 to 5 years, it creates two different tiers, and \nthis is the bone of contention, these two different tiers.\n  I would say for anyone here as of the first of the year, we should \nprovide this orange card process which I will describe in a moment. The \nproblem doing it the Hagel-Martinez way is that it opens the door for \nfraud and for manipulation because you essentially have 4.4 million \npeople here less than 5 years who would come forward and produce, in \nall likelihood, fraudulent documents, or simply remain in a clandestine \nstatus because they are working and they have families here.\n  The 2.8 million who have been here 2 to 5 years are then subject to \nleave the country, to touch back and enter into the country through a \nvisa program, most likely the H-2C worker program which has 200,000. We \nlowered the cap for the H-2C program from 325,000 to 200,000 in an \nearlier amendment offered by Senator Bingaman and myself. But what \npeople haven't realized is that the cap would be waived for individuals \ncoming in from this tier, which would raise the guest worker program to \n3 million people. And then here is the rub with the guest worker \nprogram: they would have to return after a period of time to their \ncountry. Therefore, there is no automatic path to earned legalization \nfor these people, unless they can get an employer to petition for them \nfor a green card. I think that is an unusual responsibility placed on \nan employer for so many people, and I think it is not fair for the \nemployee, either.\n  Therefore, we have put forward a three-step process under the orange \ncard amendment, which has received the support of 115 organizations and \ngroups.\n  Under this amendment, all undocumented aliens who are in the United \nStates as of January 1 would immediately register a preliminary \napplication with the Department of Homeland Security.\n  At the time of the registration, they would submit fingerprints to \nthe Customs and Immigration Services facility so that criminal and \nnational security background checks could commence. It would create a \nmore precise registration that would allow this to proceed \nelectronically. That is a major key--proceed electronically so that DHS \nwould have time to do the necessary processing and vet the application \nin an orderly manner. Then they would submit a full application for \ntheir orange card.\n  Once they have passed the security background check, they have paid \ntheir back taxes, they have paid the $2,000 fine, then they would be \nissued the orange card. The orange card would have biometric \nidentifiers, would have the history of the individual, and would have a \nnumber, and this number would be designed so that those who have been \nhere the longest would be first in the line for the green card at the \nend of the work period.\n  As everyone recalls, there are 3.3 million people back in their own \ncountries waiting for green cards. None of this goes into play until \nthat green card list is expunged. It is estimated that could take \nanywhere from 6 to 11 years. So during that period of time, individuals \nin this country would have an identifier: the orange card. This would \nbe their identification. They could come and go with it. It is fraud-\nproof, it is biometric, it has a photo, it has a fingerprint, and \ntherefore provides a safe methodology. As long as individuals fill out \nthe annual reports required by the program which attest to their work \nhistory, pay the fine, and pay their back taxes, they would keep the \norange card effectively in place.\n  I wish to comment that first of all, Senators Hagel and Martinez have \ndone a service. They have tried to work out a compromise. I find fault \nwith that compromise only when you read the small print of the bill \nlanguage. When you read the bill language, you see that it is a huge \nprogram with 4.4 million people having to be found, having to be sought \nout. If they are here for less than the 2 years, they are deported. Who \nwould deport them? How would they be found? You are going to find 2 \nmillion people? I think that is very difficult to do. We know employer \nsanctions haven't worked. In 2004, total convictions under employer \nsanctions for the tens of thousands of employers who employ these \npeople was a total number of 47.\n  So I believe the orange card would serve us well. It is a streamlined \nprocess. It has the ability to consider all people to avoid the problem \nof deportation but to create a system which is secure, where people are \nchecked out, where they are held accountable for their work, held \naccountable for their payment of back taxes, held accountable for the \npayment of a fine so they can then come out of the shadows and live a \nmore normal and more productive life.\n  This goes back to the original McCain-Kennedy formula, but in essence \nit essentially provides that there is an orderly process connected with \nthis.\n  As I said earlier, I think there is a critical flaw in Hagel-\nMartinez, and that is those people who fall into the second tier can \nremain in the United States legally for up to 3 years, and then they \nmust leave the country and find a legal program from which they may \nreenter the United States. This is the flaw because this would subject \npeople to, once again, going back into a clandestine lifestyle rather \nthan running the risk that they leave their families, go home, can't \nget into a program, and then can't come back again.\n  The other problem with the Hagel-Martinez program is that if an \nindividual doesn't work for 60 consecutive days, they are out. There is \nno provision for injury, there is no provision for illness, and when \nyou are dealing with 6 million people, that is a problem. Some people \nare going to be the victims of bona fide injuries or bona fide \ncatastrophic circumstances and not able to work for a period of time. \nSo if they become injured or ill and effectively can't be on the job \nfor 60 consecutive days at any given time during the year, they are \nthen subject to deportation.\n  I believe we have an opportunity, through the border patrol with \n12,000 additional agents, 2,500 additional inspectors, the money in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill for the border, the National Guard \ndoing logistical support and physical work on the border, and the fence \nto be built on the border, to make a major step forward in securing our \nborders. The next step and the most important part of the bill is what \nis the proper handling of the 10 million to 12 million people who are \nhere illegally in our country at this time.\n  I would respectfully submit to this body that the fair handling of \nthese people is creating a pathway to an earned--not an amnesty--but an \nearned legalization where people have to document over a consequential \nperiod of time that they are working, they are good citizens, they are \nlearning English, they are paying their taxes, and they are paying the \nfine. All of the proceeds from this fine would go to support the costs \nof the program. If there are 10 million people, at $2,000, that \nproduces $20 billion for the additional hires that are necessary to run \nthis program and hopefully run it well.\n  So we will continue to argue this tomorrow, and I ask that the \namendment be set aside at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on my \namendment, which will hopefully be reached at some point here in the \nnext day or so. It is an amendment I sponsored with Senator Cantwell \nfrom Washington, and it addresses what we see as an issue that, \nalthough not major in the context of the overall immigration debate, \nremains rather significant.\n  There is today something called a lottery system. It is \neuphemistically called the diversity lottery system, which really I \ndon't understand why it has picked up that name because it is really \nnothing like that. It is simply a lottery system. It says essentially \nthat 50,000 people will get the right to become American citizens if \nthey win a lottery and they are from countries which are deemed \nunderrepresented. Most of those countries represent Eastern Europe and \nAfrica. They don't have to do anything other than have a high school \neducation or, alternatively, have worked for 2 out of the last 5 years \nin order to participate in this lottery. So the essential effect of \nthis lottery system is that we are taking from around the world 50,000 \npeople\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nwho simply got lucky. There is no real reason we should take them. \nThere is no policy reason to take them.\n  There is no such thing as an underrepresented country really in our \nimmigration system because of the fact that there are so many illegal \nimmigrants in the country already. For example, if you were to take \nPoland, there are 47,000 people in this country who under this bill are \npresently illegal--that is the estimate--who may become legal. From \nRussia, there are about 46,000 people who qualify in that area. From \nAfrica, there are 120,000 people who fall into that category. So these \ncountries have a lot of people already here--some legally, a lot \nillegally, and they don't need representation.\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, may I interrupt the Senator just for \none brief change?\n  Mr. GREGG. As long as I will not lose the floor.\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask that instead of setting aside the \namendment, it will be continuing in a pending status.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. GREGG. So this lottery system, which was created back a while \nago--I think in the early 1990s--in a sense of good will or political \ncorrectness, really is not all that productive to us as a nation. So \nSenator Cantwell and I have taken a look at it and said: Listen, if we \nare going to have a lottery system, why don't we at least apply it to \npeople we actually need in this country to assist us in being a \nstronger nation, a more vibrant nation, a more economically successful \nnation?\n  We know that in our Nation today, we are missing--or not missing, but \nwe know we are not producing and creating enough people in the sciences \nwhich are energizing economic activity in this world: the maths, math \ndoctorates, the science doctorates. We know we have a real lack of \ntechnical ability in many arenas and that we are falling well behind \nother nations, such as China, in our ability to produce people in the \nsciences and math subjects.\n  Why not take this lottery system and say, rather than making it \navailable to the cabdriver in Kiev, whom we may or may not really need \nin the United States, let's make it available to the physicist in Kiev. \nWhy not say to the doctor in Poland or the doctor in Nigeria: You will \nhave a chance to become an American citizen and have the opportunity to \nparticipate in this lottery, rather than saying to the street sweeper \nin Poland or the miner in Nigeria: It is your chance to participate in \nthe lottery. So we have taken this proposal, which is 50,000 names \nthrown in a hat from these countries which are allegedly underserved, \nwhich are not underserved, and we changed it so that two-thirds of the \nnames thrown in this hat will be of people who have advanced science \ndegrees, which our Department of Commerce and Department of State \ndetermine are in need here in the United States. Two-thirds of those \nlottery winners will have those degrees. The other third will remain \npeople who only need to have a high school education or have worked 2 \nout of the last 5 years.\n  Basically the lottery system will be changed from being one of, we \ndon't know who is coming in the country and we don't know what they are \ngoing to contribute to our society as they come in--we hope they will \nbe people who will be hard-working and committed people, but they may \nactually be people who are not. In fact, if a person has only worked 2 \nout of the last 5 years and doesn't have a high school education, they \ncan literally qualify for the lottery. Now I ask you, is that the kind \nof person we want to have qualified for the lottery? A person who may \nhave been unemployed for 3 of the last 5 years, doesn't have a high \nschool education, but they can get into the United States under the \nlottery. I think it makes much more sense to say let's have folks who \nhave shown their energy, shown their commitment, shown their \nwillingness to strive within their own communities by obtaining these \nadvanced degrees, let's have those folks participate in the lottery.\n  Some will say the H-1B program already solves this because it is \ngreatly expanded in this bill, and that allows people with advanced \ndegrees to come into this country. That is true. That is good. This \nbill is excellent in that manner. But as a practical matter, this \nlottery would go to people who do not qualify for H-1B. In other words, \nto get an H-1B visa, you have to have a sponsor or, in other words, an \nemployer here in the United States who is going to hire you or you have \nto have a family member who will sponsor you to come into the country.\n  There are a lot of people out there in these allegedly underserved \ncountries who do not have somebody who is going to employ them because \nthe groups that employ foreign nationals who have advanced science \ndegrees don't go to those countries. They don't recruit in those \ncountries, for all intents and purposes. And they don't have a family \nmember here. So they are out of it. They can't get in. So it makes \nsense to take the lottery system and convert it to something that is \ngoing to be an add-on to America's success.\n  We hear a lot in this Chamber, especially from some of our \ncolleagues, that we are outsourcing jobs, we are outsourcing our jobs \nto other countries. What this proposal does is it insources people who \nwill create jobs in our country. It says let's go out and find the best \nand the brightest people around the world and say: Listen, we would \nlike to have you live in the United States and create jobs in the \nUnited States, use your ability to produce in the United States. If you \ndon't have a person who wants to employ you and you don't have a spouse \nhere who is willing to sponsor you or a family member who is willing to \nsponsor you, we still would like you to have a shot at coming here, \nbecause most would like to, and we have a lottery system that says you \ncan win it and get into this country.\n  I note that under the present lottery system, we have seen abuses. In \nfact, the report of the inspector general of the State Department found \nsignificant fraud and mismanagement of this program and the fact that \npeople were coming into the country who really should not have come \ninto the country, but they won the lottery or they were relatives of \npeople who won the lottery. Obviously, the most egregious example of \nthat was the terrorist individual who attacked the L.A. airport and \nshot up the El Al counter. He was in the United States because his \nspouse had won the lottery. Not a good decision for us.\n  It seems to me that rather than just flipping a coin and saying: Hey, \nlisten, if you are out there and you want to come to work and you are \nfrom one of these countries which are allegedly underserved--which, by \nthe way, they are not underserved, as I pointed out in the early part \nof my statement--you have a chance to come here. Let's at least say for \nthe majority of the people who have won the lottery that you have to \nhave done something, you have to have shown something, you have to have \nproduced something, you have to have been willing to go out there and \nshow you have the character and the energy and the intelligence to \nactually be an addition to our society, an add-on, a creator of jobs in \nour society, a creator of economic activity, a creator of a stronger \nsociety rather than just have the good fortune of having drawn a lucky \nnumber.\n  That is what this bill does. I cannot really understand the \nopposition to it. A lottery system--I am not sure it ever really had a \ngood time to exist, but clearly now is not a good time for it to exist. \nWe have 12 million people in this country who arguably won the lottery \nby coming into this country illegally. I guess you could say that. \nUnder this bill, some of them are really going to win the lottery \nbecause they are going to go to the back of the line, but they are \ngetting on the line and obtaining what is called earned citizenship, as \nthe Senator from California was saying. But the simple fact is, we \ndon't need to add to that great mass of people. They are here already. \nIf we are going to add people to our culture from the immigration \nstandpoint, let's add people who we know on the face of it are likely \nto contribute significantly to making us a stronger and more vibrant \nnation, especially economically.\n  If we are going to have a lottery, let's just not make it an \narbitrary event. Let's make it something that assists not only the \nperson who wins but also our Nation, so that both sides\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nare winners under the lottery, not just one side.\n  The House took a look at the lottery. In their bill, they determined \nit was so inappropriate, they simply abolished it altogether. So it \nseems to me if we take this position we will be strongly positioned in \nconference to present the case that the lottery can work for us as a \nnation, rather than be a loss leader. That is why this amendment has \npicked up considerable support. It is bipartisan support.\n  I look forward to having a more extensive debate on it with my \ncosponsor, Senator Cantwell, who understands. She comes from Washington \nState where they understand the need to get some top-quality people in \nour country in the area of science, as the home of Microsoft, which is \nclearly the engine of the Internet, the engine of the expansion of \ntechnology over the Internet and in computer science that has driven \nthe world, not only the United States. They understand uniquely in \nWashington State, as we all hopefully do, the need to bring smart, \nintelligence people from across the world into our Nation and keep us \ncompetitive with countries such as China that are turning out four or \nfive or six times the number of scientists we are turning out annually.\n  That is why this is important. It is not, obviously, the biggest vote \non this stage. There have been a lot of votes dealing with the \nsubstance of this bill which has huge implications relative to the \nnumbers of people who come into this country and how they come into \nthis country and how we protect our borders, but it is one part of the \nsystem we have to make more rational, better, but to be a system where \nnot only does the immigrant win but America wins.\n  With that, I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of the \namendment of Senator Gregg to deal with the lottery provision that is \ncurrently in the code involving immigration. We have many odd and \ncurious provisions in our immigration law, but I suppose the lottery \nprovision is one of the most odd and most curious. It seems to me to be \nunprincipled, without any real thought as to how it would effect a \npolicy that is good for America. What kind of thing is this, that you \ndo a lottery to let people come in from around the world?\n  His approach would be to say: Let's focus two-thirds of those slots \non people with higher skills and higher education. I want to speak in \nfavor of that and say, really, we need not only to do this two-thirds, \nbut it would be better, in my view, to do the whole lottery program in \nthis fashion. In addition, we need to reevaluate entirely this bill \nwhich is before us today to ask ourselves with some thoughtfulness how \nwe can make future immigration policy beneficial to our country. It \nought to benefit us. Everybody who comes here, no matter how poor or \nuneducated, according to the witnesses we heard at our one hearing, is \nbenefited economically.\n  The poorer they are the more they benefit. They benefit, but the \nquestion is, What about the United States? Do we benefit? Is it a net \ngain for the United States?\n  We had a number of professors who testified--Professor Freeman, \nProfessor Siciliano, Professor Chiswick, and others whose names escape \nme--and talked about this quite openly. These are the fundamental facts \nthat should be part of any thoughtful, comprehensive reform of \nimmigration in America.\n  The facts are these: People with college credit, people with a \ncollege degree uniformly contribute more to this country in taxes than \nthey take out in benefits. The people who come to our country with less \nthan a high school education, a high school dropout or somebody who \njust didn't have the opportunity, they don't have a high school \ndegree--and over 50 percent of illegal immigrants entering our country \ntoday are without a high school degree--those people, it is uniformly \nagreed by professional economists who studied this issue, most of whom \ntestified at our committee, strongly favor immigration but they all \nagree they will on average--not every single one but on average--draw \nmore from the U.S. Treasury and U.S. coffers than they put in.\n  Does that tell us anything? What is happening in Canada? What is \nhappening in France right now? What has already happened in Britain, \nAustralia, Switzerland, and the Netherlands? These countries have \nreevaluated their immigration policy. They are focusing on bringing in \npeople who benefit the country.\n  We cannot accept everybody. Isn't it a simple principle? There is no \nway this country can accept everybody who would like to come.\n  The leading expert on immigration--I think universally agreed on \nimmigration--such as Professor Voorhas from the Kennedy School at \nHarvard, he himself is an immigrant. He immigrated here from Cuba. The \nname of his book, probably the most authoritative book on the entire \nsubject, is entitled ``Heaven's Door.'' What is that? ``Heaven's Door'' \nis entry into the United States.\n  For a poor person in the Third World who has been abused by a legal \nsystem that does not work, who does not have clean water, who does not \nhave a legitimate job, who does not have electricity, getting to the \nUnited States, the title of his book, is like going through Heaven's \ndoor. It is a tremendous thing.\n  But the world has a lot of people in it. We already have a lot of \npeople in the United States. We have to ask ourselves: How many can we \nwelcome? What people will achieve their dreams and aspirations most \nsuccessfully here, people who are high school dropouts or people who \nhave a greater education?\n  We also need to ask, as Canada does: Do they speak English? Australia \ndoes. They ought to speak English before they come here.\n  What is it about letting in hundreds and hundreds of thousands of \npeople on the theory that they might one day learn English, and that \nwould be a requirement for citizenship. But if we have gotten more \napplicants than we can accept, why would we not want to ask ourselves \nwhether we should give extra points, a higher listing on the list, if \nthey already speak English? They would be guaranteed to be more \nsuccessful here and more likely to assimilate, more likely to be \npromoted, more likely to be a boss over other people. If you can't \nspeak the language, how can you ever rise to be a supervisor?\n  Those are important things, I submit, and not considered in the \nlegislation before us at all.\n  Senator Craig's amendment is a very good amendment. It focuses on a \ncritical matter. Let me tell you what my staff has concluded from their \ncareful study of the bill. We believe that as it is presently written \ntoday only 30 percent of the people coming into this country will come \nin as a result of their skills or education. That is a pretty stunning \nnumber. Only 30 percent coming into our country will have their entry \nevaluated, their skill level or their education level, whereas 70 \npercent will come into our country for other reasons.\n  For example, if a young man came to our country under the new guest \nworker program that would be made law today, and that guest worker \nprogram would allow him to come into the country to file for a green \ncard the first day he arrived here, within 5 years from that he can \napply for and obtain as of right his citizenship in the United States. \nThat will happen under the bill. Within 6 years, the person could \npossibly be a citizen of the United States coming in under a program \nwhich the bill says is a temporary guest worker provision. They say it \nis a temporary guest worker section of the bill. It has big letters, \n``Temporary Guest Worker.''\n  But on the first day they get here, their employer can ask for a \ngreen card. A green card means you have legal permanent residence. \nWithin 5 years of getting that card, they can become a citizen. A legal \npermanent resident means if you never seek citizenship you can stay in \nthe country once you get that green card for the rest of your life.\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\n  What I am saying is, under this provision a young man can come in--\nand he is 20 years of age. If he works 5 or 6 years, he becomes a \ncitizen. Now he is 30, and he has a 50-year-old brother, a 60-year-old, \na 70-year-old mother and father. They can be brought into this country \nunder chain migration, whether or not they have any skills or any \neducation that would be relevant to their success in the United States \nof America.\n  Think about this: Let us say they are both from Honduras. Let us say \nthis is a young man who was valedictorian of his school in Honduras, \nwho had a chance to take an English course and took English and learned \nit well, was able to go to a technical college and became skilled in \nelectricity, and he applies at age 21 to come to the United States. \nWould he not have the advantage over a 50-year-old brother or a 70-\nyear-old mother of someone who is already here when those people who \nmay or may not have any skills which would be beneficial to the country \ncould likely became a drain on the Nation's resources?\n  That is how we have 70 percent of the people coming into our country \nunder the new provision who are supposed to be in a comprehensive \nreform of the immigration system? That does not make sense. We need to \nfocus more on providing opportunities for people to enter our country \nwho have the greatest potential to succeed. It is perfectly proper and \nlegitimate for us to ask: What is the worker status, the wages that are \nbeing paid in a given area, and do we have a shortage?\n  In my view, the Department of Labor should not allow surging \nimmigration when we have certain fields in the United States where \nthere are more workers than there are jobs and you let a bunch of \npeople come in from out of the country to take what few jobs there are \nleaving Americans unemployed.\n\n  We need to consider all of those things. But, fundamentally, when you \nmake a choice between two individuals--a younger person, a person who \nspeaks English, a person who has skills--who is going to be far more \nsuccessful? If they are successful here themselves, and if they benefit \nand if they are blessed by the great freedoms and economic prosperity \nand the free market we have in America, if they are blessed by that, \nthey will pay more taxes to the Government than they draw from the \nGovernment. That is a pretty good thing, I submit.\n  One reason I have been so critical of this legislation--and I remain \nsteadfastly convinced that it is not worthy of the Senate of the United \nStates--is the legislation seems to have given no thought to these \nissues whatsoever. We certainly never had a hearing to deal with it, to \nmy knowledge. A lot of things we haven't done that we could have done. \nWe could have studied more, we could have had more experts come in and \ntestify and help us craft the legislation. We should have brought in \nimmigration people who work for the Government of the United States to \nfind out what is working and what is not working.\n  I talked to the person in the Dominican Republic, the American \nconsulate official who meets with those people in the Dominican \nRepublic who would like to come to the United States. He seemed like a \nvery nice guy. He made some mention about sham marriages. So we talked \nabout that.\n  As a U.S. attorney prosecuting a case where people created a sham \nmarriage for immigration purposes, he said they won't even talk about \nprosecuting a case in the Dominican Republic. And he has seen lots and \nlots of sham marriage cases that were never prosecuted.\n  Why do they have a sham marriage? Because if you are married to \nsomebody who is in the United States, they can take their wife and \ntheir children. That is the way to get people here. So they create a \nsham marriage.\n  But he told me that 95 percent of the people in the Dominican \nRepublic who were approved to come to the United States were approved \nunder the chain migration or family connection provisions in our code.\n  Fundamentally, almost no one coming from the Dominican Republic to \nthe United States is coming because they have a skill that would \nbenefit us and that would indicate their likely success in our society. \nThey come in because some other family member of a qualified relation \nis here as a citizen or even a green card holder. That is how they get \nto come. They are creating a false document to show these are relatives \nor their spouses and they are married when it is not so.\n  As I have said a number of times on the Senate floor, 60 percent of \nthe people in Nicaragua in a recent poll said they would come to the \nUnited States if they could, and I understand 70 percent of the people \nin Peru, when polled, said they would come to the United States if they \ncould.\n  What does that mean? Think about it.\n  Mexico, all of Central America, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, \nJamaica, Morocco, all of the African nations, the Middle East, \nBangladesh, China, India, Taiwan, the Philippines--all these nations \naround the world with great people in them--wonderful people but in \neach one of those countries are significant numbers of people, I \nsubmit, who would come to the United States if they could. Wouldn't it \nbe a good policy for our Nation? Wouldn't it be the right thing to \nthink seriously about who should come, like Canada and Britain, and as \nFrance did last week, and refocus our attention on accepting a certain \nnumber of people but making sure those people bring skills and talents \nwith them to indicate they would be a positive benefit to our society \nrather than a net drain on society?\n\n  That is a challenge. We simply cannot accept everyone who wants to \ncome. It is painful to bring people who are not able to speak English \nor effectively take advantage of the opportunities our country has. \nWhen they do not do that, they do not do well. They tend to pull \nthemselves apart and continue to speak their own language. They do not \nadvance and assimilate and become part of the great melting pot we are \nso proud of as Americans.\n  It is a big step forward to take this lottery, to put two-thirds of \nthose people who are in it, who are now chosen by random chance, \nwithout any regard to skills or abilities or language or those matters, \nto at least set them aside for high-skilled positions for education, \nscience, mathematics. It would be a great benefit to our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Senate resumed its consideration \nof comprehensive immigration reform last week I began by expressing my \nhope that we would finish the job the Judiciary Committee started in \nMarch and the Senate began in April. We need to fix the broken \nimmigration system with tough reforms that secure our borders and with \nreforms that will bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the \nshadows. I have said all along that Democratic Senators cannot pass a \nfair and comprehensive bill alone. Last week we got some help.\n  We got some words of encouragement from President Bush last Monday \nnight when he began speaking out more forcefully and in more specific \nterms about all of the components needed for comprehensive legislation. \nFor the first time, he expressly endorsed a pathway to earned \ncitizenship for the millions of undocumented workers now here. I thank \nhim for joining in this effort. We will need his influence with the \nrecalcitrant members of his party here in the Senate, and especially in \nthe House, if we are ultimately to be successful in our legislative \neffort. Without effective intervention of the President, this effort is \nunlikely to be successful and the prospects for securing our borders \nand dealing with the hopes of millions who now live in the shadows of \nour society will be destroyed. Those who have peacefully demonstrated \ntheir dedication to justice and comprehensive immigration reform should \nnot be relegated back into the shadows.\n  Last week the Senate made progress. We made progress because \nDemocratic and Republican Senators working together rejected the most \nstrident attacks on the comprehensive bill that we are considering. We \njoined together in a bipartisan coalition in the Judiciary Committee \nwhen we reported the Judiciary Committee bill. Democratic Senators were \nready to join together in April and supported the Republican leader's \nmotion that would have resulted in incorporating features from the \nHagel-Martinez bill, but Republicans balked at that time and continued \nto filibuster action. Last week, Republicans joined with us to defend \nthe\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\ncore provisions of that bill, and we defeated efforts by Senators Kyl \nand Cornyn to gut the guest worker provisions and to undermine the \npathway to earned citizenship. Instead, we adopted the Bingaman \namendment to cap the annual guest worker program at 200,000 and the \nObama amendment regarding prevailing wages in order to better protect \nthe opportunities and wages of American workers.\n  I spoke last week about the need to strengthen our border security \nafter more than 5 years of neglect and failure by the Bush-Cheney \nadministration. A recent report concluded that the number of people \napprehended at our borders for illegal entry fell 31 percent on \nPresident Bush's watch, from a yearly average of 1.52 million between \n1996 and 2000, to 1.05 million between 2001 and 2004. The number of \nillegal immigrants apprehended while in the interior of the country \ndeclined 36 percent, from a yearly average of roughly 40,000 between \n1996 and 2000, to 25,901 between 2001 and 2004. Audits and fines \nagainst employers of illegal immigrants have also fallen significantly \nsince President Bush took office. Given the vast increases in the \nnumber of Border Patrol agents, the decline in enforcement can only be \nexplained by a failure of leadership.\n  The recent aggressive and well-publicized enforcement efforts to \ndetain illegal immigrants seem to be election-year posturing that does \nlittle to improve the situation. We need comprehensive reform, backed \nup by leadership committed to using the tools Congress provides, not to \npiecemeal political stunts.\n  Once again the administration is turning to the fine men and women of \nNational Guard. After our intervention turned sour in Iraq, the \nPentagon turned to the Guard. After the government-wide failure in \nresponding to Hurricane Katrina, we turned to the Guard. Now, the \nadministration's longstanding lack of focus on our porous Southern \nborder and failure to develop a comprehensive immigration policy has \nprompted the administration to turn once again to the Guard. I remain \npuzzled that this administration, which seems so ready to take \nadvantage of the Guard, fights so vigorously against providing this \nessential force with adequate equipment, a seat at the table in policy \ndebates, or even adequate health insurance for the men and women of the \nGuard.\n  I have cautioned that any Guard units should operate under the \nauthority of State Governors. In addition, the Federal Government \nshould pick up the full costs of such a deployment. Those costs should \nnot be foisted onto the States and their already overtaxed Guard units.\n  Controlling our borders is a national responsibility, and it is \nregrettable that so much of this duty has been punted to the States and \nnow to the Guard. The Guard is pitching in above and beyond, balancing \nits already demanding responsibilities to the States, while sending \ntroops who have been deployed to Iraq. The Guard served admirably in \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina when the Federal Government failed to \nprepare or respond in a timely or sufficient manner. The Vermont Guard \nand others have been contributing to our national security since the \nimmediate aftermath of 9/11. After 5 years of failing to utilize the \nauthority and funding Congress has provided to strengthen the Border \nPatrol and our border security, the administration is, once again, \nturning to the National Guard.\n  It was instructive that last week President Bush and congressional \nRepublicans staged a bill-signing for legislation that continues \nbillions of dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy. Instead of a budget \nwith robust and complete funding for our Border Patrol and border \nsecurity, the President has focused on providing tax cuts for the \nwealthiest among us. Congress has had to step in time and again to \ncreate new border agent positions and direct that they be filled. \nInstead of urging his party to take early and decisive action to pass \ncomprehensive immigration reform, as he signaled he would in February \n2001, the President began his second term campaigning to undercut the \nprotections of our Social Security system, and the American people \nsignaled their opposition to those undermining steps. While the \nPresident talks about the importance of our first responders, he has \nproposed 67 percent cuts in the grant program that supplies bulletproof \nvests to police officers.\n  Five years of the Bush-Cheney administration's inaction and misplaced \npriorities have done nothing to improve our immigration situation. The \nSenate just passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill that \nallocated nearly $2 billion from military accounts to border security. \nThe Democratic leader had proposed that the funds not be taken from the \ntroops. But last week the President sent a request for diverting a like \namount of funding, intended for capital improvements for border \nsecurity, into operations and deployment of the National Guard. The \nRepublican chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nHomeland Security came to the Senate floor last week to give an \nextraordinary speech in this regard.\n  In addition, last week the Senate adopted a billion-dollar amendment \nto build fencing along the Southern border without saying how it would \nbe funded. We also adopted amendments by Senators Bingaman, Kerry, and \nNelson of Florida to strengthen our enforcement efforts.\n  Border security alone is not enough to solve our immigration \nproblems. We must pass a bill--and enact a law--that will not only \nstrengthen the security along our borders, but that will also encourage \nmillions of people to come out of the shadows. When this is \naccomplished we will be more secure because we will know who is living \nand working in the United States. We must encourage the undocumented to \ncome forward, undergo background checks, and pay taxes to earn a place \non the path to citizenship.\n  Last week we defeated an Ensign amendment to deny persons in legal \nstatus the Social Security benefits to which they are fairly entitled. \nI believe that most Americans will agree with that decision as fair and \njust. It maintains the trust of the Social Security trust fund for \nthose workers who contribute to the fund.\n  The opponents of our bipartisan bill have made a number of assaults \non our comprehensive approach. Senators Kyl, Sessions, and Cornyn \nopposed the Judiciary Committee bill. Senators Vitter, Ensign, and \nInhofe have been very active in the amendment process, as well. I hope \nthat they recognize how fairly they have been treated and the time they \nhave been given to argue their case against the bill and offer \namendments. We have adopted their amendments where possible. A narrowed \nversion of the Kyl-Cornyn amendment disqualifying some from seeking \nlegalization was adopted. The Sessions amendment on fencing was \nadopted. The Vitter amendment on documents was adopted. The Ensign \namendment on the National Guard is being considered. Over my strong \nobjection and that of the Democratic leader, Senator Salazar and \nothers, a modified version of the Inhofe amendment designating English \nas our national language was even adopted. This amendment is wrong and \nhas understandably provoked a reaction from the Latino community as \nexemplified by the May 19 letter from the League of United Latin \nAmerican Citizens, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational \nFund, the National Association of Latino Elected Officials Educational \nFund, the National Council of La Raza, the National Puerto Rican \nCoalition, and from a larger coalition of interested parties as \nreflected in a May 19 letter from 96 national and local organizations. \nI will ask copies of these two letters be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  I trust that with so many of their amendments having been fairly \nconsidered and some having been adopted, those in the opposition to \nthis measure will reevaluate their previous filibuster, that they will \nvote for cloture, and, I will hope, support the compromise bill.\n  Immigration reform must be comprehensive if it is to lead to real \nsecurity and real reform. Enforcement-only measures may sound tough but \nthey are insufficient. The President has acknowledged this truth. Our \nbipartisan support of the Senate bill is based on our shared \nrecognition of this fact. In these next few days, the Senate has an \nopportunity, and a responsibility, to pass a bill that addresses our \nbroken system, with comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned letters be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 19, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned national Latino \n     organizations, we are writing to express our grave concern at \n     the passage of the Inhofe Amendment to the immigration reform \n     bill currently under consideration in the Senate. We believe \n     this amendment jeopardizes the health and safety of all \n     Americans by undercutting federal, state, and local \n     government's capacity to provide vital information and \n     services to immigrants and Americans who are speakers of \n     other languages. This amendment has nothing to do with \n     immigration reform, and it does nothing to help immigrants \n     learn English. We believe it has no place in this bill and \n     urge you to reconsider it.\n       Upon review of the language of this amendment, we have \n     reached the conclusion that it would undercut policies that \n     facilitate communication with people who are speakers of \n     other languages. If this amendment becomes law, it would \n     jeopardize the delivery of public health and safety messages \n     that are intended to protect all Americans. The amendment \n     would make it more difficult for agencies like the Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to respond to a flu \n     pandemic, another hurricane disaster like Katrina, or another \n     terrorist attack. If some portion of the community does not \n     receive information about immunizations or other health \n     threats in a language they can understand. then the entire \n     public is at risk.\n       We are also offended by the premise reflected in the \n     amendment and the debate which took place on the Senate floor \n     that the English language is somehow ``under attack'' in the \n     United States. Immigrants and all Americans understand that \n     English is our common language. If there is a challenge to \n     the integration of immigrants. it is that there are \n     insufficient English classes available to meet the demand \n     from immigrants who are eager to take them; the Inhofe \n     Amendment does not help a single immigrant learn English. We \n     stand ready to join in a debate on how to create new \n     resources and options to facilitate English classes and the \n     full integration of immigrants into our society. We deeply \n     regret that the Senate failed to choose this course of action \n     and instead voted on a counterproductive proposal that would \n     do real harm while doing nothing to promote English-language \n     acquisition.\n       The presence of this amendment in the immigration reform \n     bill calls into question our community's support of the \n     immigration reform package. We urge you in the strongest \n     possible terms to reconsider this damaging vote.\n           Sincerely,\n       Hector Flores, National President, League of United Latin \n     American Citizens (LULAC).\n       John Trasvina, Interim President and General Counsel, \n     Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF).\n       Arturo Vargas, Executive Director, National Association of \n     Latino Elected Officials Educational Fund (NALEO).\n       Janet Murguia, President and CEO, National, Council of La \n     Raza (NCLR).\n       Manuel Mirabal, President and CEO, National Puerto Rican \n     Coalition (NPRC).\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 19, 2006.\n       Dear Senator: We, the undersigned 96 national and local \n     organizations, understand that the Senate voted yesterday to \n     approve an amendment offered by Senator Inhofe which affirms \n     English as the nation's national language and which could \n     undercut policies which facilitate communication with people \n     who are speakers of other languages. We are alarmed at this \n     development and urge you to reconsider this ill-advised vote.\n       There is no question that English is the common language of \n     this Nation; many of our organizaions offer English-language \n     classes and can testify to the fact that the demand for \n     instruction far exceeds the supply. If there is one single \n     issue that stands in the way of immigrants learning English, \n     it is a lack of resources to provide sufficient classes for \n     those seeking to take them. We are sorely disappointed that \n     the Senate debate on language focused on a proposal to limit \n     communication with immigrants rather than on increasing \n     access to programs that can actually assist immigrants as \n     they attempt to learn English while working, raising \n     families, and contributing in multiple ways to the vibrancy \n     of this country.\n       In addition, the Inhofe Amendment undermines the health and \n     safety of all Americans by undercutting federal, state, and \n     local government's capacity to provide vital information and \n     services to immigrants and Americans who are speakers of \n     other languages. It would jeopardize the delivery of public \n     health and safety messages that are intended to protect all \n     Americans. The amendment could make it more difficult for \n     agencies like the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) \n     and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to \n     respond to a flu pandemic, another hurricane disaster like \n     Katrina, or another terrorist attack. If some portion of the \n     community does not receive information about immunizations or \n     other health threats in a language they understand, then the \n     entire public is at risk.\n       This amendment has nothing to do with immigration reform, \n     and it does nothing to help immigrants learn English. We \n     believe it has no place in this bill and urge you to \n     reconsider it.\n           Sincerely,\n       ACORN; American Immigration Lawyers Association; Americans \n     for Democratic Action, Inc.; Arab Community Center for \n     Economic and Social Services; Asian American Justice Center; \n     Asian American Institute; Asian and Pacific Islander American \n     Health Forum; Asian Pacific Islander Coalition of King \n     County; Asian Communities for Reproductive Justice; Asian Law \n     Alliance; Asian Law Caucus; Asian Pacific American Legal \n     Center of Southern California; ASPIRA; Bell Policy Center-\n     Denver; Break the Cycle; Carter and Alterman; CASA of \n     Maryland, Inc.; Center for Justice, Peace and the \n     Environment; Center for Law and Social Policy; Central \n     American Resource Center/CARECEN-L.A.; Centro de la \n     Comunidad, Inc.\n       Centro Hispano of Dane County; Chinese for Affirmative \n     Action/Center for Asian American Advocacy; CHIRLA; Coalition \n     of Limited English Speaking Elderly; Community Legal \n     Services, Inc.; Cross-Cultural Communications, LLC; Cuban \n     American National Council; District of Columbia's Fellowship \n     of Reconciliation; Escuela Tlatelolco Centro de Estudios; \n     Fuerza Latina; Greater New York Labor-Religion Coalition; \n     Immigrant Legal Resource Center; Immigration Law Office of \n     Kimberly Salinas; Institute of the Sisters of Mercy of the \n     Americas; Korean American Voters Alliance; Korean Resource \n     Center--Los Angeles; La Causa Inc.; La Clinica del Pueblo; \n     Latino and Latina Roundtable of the San Gabriel Valley and \n     Pomona Valley; Latino Leadership, Inc.;\n       Law Center For Families; Lawyers' Committee for Civil \n     Rights Under Law; League of United Latin American Citizens; \n     Legal Momentum; Luther Immigration and Refugee Service; \n     Mary's Center for Maternal and Child Care, Inc.; Mexican-\n     American Council; Migrant Legal Action Program; Minnesota \n     Immigrant Freedom Network; NAACP; National Advocacy Center of \n     the Sisters of the Good Shepherd; National Association of \n     Latino Elected Officials; National Association of Social \n     Workers; National Council for Community and Education \n     Partnerships; National Council of La Raza; National Health \n     Law Program; National Immigration Law Center; National \n     Korean American Service & Education Consortium; National \n     Latina Health Network National Organization for Women.\n       National Network for Arab American Communities; National \n     Network to End Domestic Violence; National Network to End \n     Violence Against Immigrant Women; National Partnership for \n     Women & Families; National Puerto Rican Coalition; New York \n     Asian Women's Center; New York Immigration Coalition; OCA \n     Greater Seattle Chapter; PeaceAction Montgomery; People for \n     the American Way; Presbyterian Church (USA); Resource Center \n     of the Americas; Rio Grande Centers, Inc.; SEIU Local 21--\n     Louisiana; SEIU Local 32BJ; Service Employees International \n     Union; Sexual Assault Services Organization; South Florida \n     Jobs with Justice; Southeast Asia Resource Action Center; \n     SSG/PALS for Health Program--SSG/ALAS para tu Salud.\n       Tahirih Justice Center; Teachers of English to Speakers of \n     Other Languages, Inc.; The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \n     Committee; The California Pan-Ethnic Health Network; The Fair \n     Immigration Reform Movement; The Korean American Resource & \n     Cultural Center--Chicago; The Mexican American Legal Defense \n     and Educational Fund; The National Asian Pacific American \n     Women's Forum; The National Capital Immigration Coalition; \n     UFCW Region One; UNITE HERE; United Methodist Church, General \n     Board of Church and Society; WA State Coalition Against \n     Domestic Violence; Women's Committee of 100; YKASEC--\n     Empowering the Korean American Community--New York.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, we have had a good process to this point on \nthe immigration bill. I thank the bill managers for their hard work. We \nare now, as I outlined this morning, in our final week prior to our \nrecess. We have a lot of legislative and executive items we need to \ncomplete before that recess. Therefore, in a moment, I will be filing \ncloture on the immigration bill to ensure we will complete action \nbefore the Memorial Day recess, by the end of this week. In doing so I \nhope we can still have a fair process and continue to work through \namendments.\n  There are a number of germane amendments that may be in order \npostcloture. I hope Senators will have the opportunity to have votes on \nthem.\n  Having said that, we also have a lengthy list of important executive \nnominations that I will be discussing with the Democratic leader. It is \nmy hope we can reach time agreements on these so we can schedule those \nnominations for votes this week, as well.\n  One of the nominations we will consider is the nomination of Brett \nKavanaugh to be a U.S. circuit court judge. I understand we would not \nbe able to reach a time limit for that nomination for this week. \nTherefore, it\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\nis my intention to file cloture on that nomination, as well.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  I now send a cloture motion to the desk on the comprehensive \nimmigration bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I have been discussing with the minority \nleader the nomination this morning and over the course of the day and \nwill continue to work with him as we try to reach a time agreement with \nrespect to getting an up-or-down vote later this week. It is because we \nhave not been able to agree to that, that I filed cloture to ensure we \nhave a vote on this nomination.\n  I expect the full Senate to vote on this nomination.

He is an \noutstanding candidate, a candidate who has stellar credentials, both in \nthe private sector and the public sector, working as counsel and \nadviser to the President. He has had a distinguished legal career that \nhas had him argue before the Supreme Court and appeals courts around \nthe country. He is a graduate of Yale University and Yale Law School \nwhere he served on the law journal. He has, on three separate \noccasions, received the American Bar Association stamp of approval.\n  He was nominated 3 years ago. He has waited 3 years for the vote we \nwill have later this week, for that fair up-or-down vote. It is time \nthe Senate fulfills its constitutional duty, the advice and consent, by \ngiving Mr. Kavanaugh that vote he deserves. I look forward to moving \nahead on his nomination and upholding the confirmation process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4880-4", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4880-S4881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM ACT OF 2006--Continued\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be closing shortly, but I do want to \ncomment briefly on the immigration bill today. I want to make a few \nremarks on where we are and then where we will be going.\n  Mr. President, we began debate on the comprehensive immigration \nreform before the Easter recess. The majority was at that time set to \nstrengthen the underlying bill by having debate and amendment on the \nunderlying bill to be able to toughen the border security aspect, but \nat the 11th hour, the other side said: No, we are not going to allow \nthat open debate and amendment process. So what had come to the floor \nunder the leadership of Chairman Specter was a bipartisan bill that did \nneed continued work, and that bipartisan effort was scuttled for a \nperiod of time.\n  The Democratic leader and I agreed to a process whereby we could \nbring that bill back to the floor, which was the beginning of last \nweek, where we, in a bipartisan way, would have that opportunity to \noffer amendments and attempt to improve or adjust or modify that bill. \nThat is the process we are in the middle of right now.\n  I am pleased where we are today, but as I said 2 weeks ago or 3 weeks \nago, we do need to complete this bill before the Memorial Day recess. \nResuming consideration in the early part of last week, we have made \nreal progress. And I do not know the exact number of amendments, but we \nhave had amendments every day come to the floor for those up-or-down \nvotes from both the Republican and the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  We allowed discussion and debate, and I think the country's \nunderstanding of this legislation, which is complex, has improved over \nthe course of the several weeks we have had it on the floor. We are all \nlooking closer at what is in the underlying bill, with the proposing of \namendments to modify that, and having good debate--Democrat and \nRepublican--on the issue.\n  The more time we spend with it, the more time we come to understand \nthere are some very good things about the bill, things that still need \nsome correction. And we will have the opportunity to do that, with the \ncloture motion filed tonight, over the course of voting in the morning, \ntomorrow afternoon, Wednesday over the course of the day, and once \ncloture is in effect, still have germane amendments come to the floor. \nSo that process needs to continue. What it will do is allow us to \ncomplete that bill before Memorial Day.\n  We have had a number of amendments that have been interesting to \nwatch as we have gone forward. Mr. Sessions, the Senator from Alabama, \nhad an amendment early on to strengthen our southern border, to build \nthose 370 miles of triple-layered fence, and 500 miles of vehicle \nbarriers at strategic locations--a clear-cut improvement on the bill, \nstrengthening the bill along the border consistent with our first \npriority; that is, to secure that border.\n  The Senate also approved the amendment by Senators Kyl, Graham, \nCornyn, and Allen to close a loophole in the bill that would allow \ncriminal aliens to obtain legal status. Once people looked at that, \nthey said that is only common sense. Again, it became overwhelmingly \nsupported in a bipartisan way--again, an important demonstration of why \nit was important to have open debate and amendment. That amendment \nclarifies that any illegal alien who is ineligible for a visa or who \nhas been convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors is ineligible for \na green card--again, just common sense.\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\n  Another commonsense issue of national cohesion that really hits at \nthe heart of what makes this country great was when the Senate voted in \nfavor of an amendment by Senator Inhofe to require that English be \ndeclared our national language of the United States. As people listened \nto that and digested what it meant, people said: Well, of course \nEnglish is a necessary tool for every aspiring American to be \nsuccessful and to join the mainstream of American society.\n  That is just an example of a few of the amendments. Again, we have \nconsidered a number of amendments, and we will consider a number more \nas we go forward.\n  It was last October when I said we would start with border security \nand we would build out a comprehensive approach to this very \nchallenging problem of thousands--indeed, hundreds of thousands--of \npeople coming across our borders illegally and millions working in this \ncountry illegally and many taking advantage of our social services \nillegally in this country. So we have made real progress--again \nstarting in October--and we will complete that process by the Memorial \nDay recess, with the action I took tonight.\n  Mr. President, given our policy meetings tomorrow afternoon, I now \nask unanimous consent that the filing deadline under rule XXII be \nextended until 2:30 p.m. on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4881-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Tragically, he died in \nBayji, Iraq, on April 3, 2005, as he and his fellow soldiers were \nescorting a supply convoy. An improvised explosive device detonated \nnear his military vehicle. He was 27 years old.\n  For his valorous service, Sergeant Sherrill was awarded the Bronze \nStar Medal and the Purple Heart. He had previously received both the \nArmy Good Conduct Medal and the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, and he was \nawarded the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal, the second highest \nhonor that the Commonwealth of Kentucky can bestow.\n  James moved around the country a bit growing up, but while he was \nstill young, the Sherrill family settled in Kentucky--Ekron, to be \nprecise, a small town of a few hundred people in Meade County and the \nbirthplace of legendary Baseball Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese. In Ekron, \nJames and his younger brother B.J. would grow up together and become \nwell known throughout the community.\n  The Sherrills are a close-knit family. William ``Buddy'' Sherrill and \nhis wife Beatrice, two soft-spoken people, have a lifetime of memories \nof their son James. William and Beatrice raised James and B.J. to love \nothers, respect authority, and to be true gentlemen.\n  Being the older brother, James took his role as his brother's keeper \nseriously--most of the time. Beatrice recalls, however, when James and \nB.J. were still very young, one time when B.J. imagined himself to be \nthe superhero Batman. To inaugurate his career as a caped crusader and \nto strike fear in the hearts of criminals, B.J. decided to jump out a \nwindow.\n  But heights can be intimidating, especially to a small child. Even \none wearing a cape and a mask. So just as he was about to jump, B.J. \nhesitated.\n  Noticing his younger brother sitting on the edge of the windowsill in \nthe Sherrill home, James decided it was up to him to help his brother \nout the only way he knew how. So James came up behind B.J. and gave him \nthe push he wasn't looking for.\n  Asked why he had just pushed his brother out the window, James looked \nup at his parents and told them sincerely he was only ``trying to help \nhis brother.'' Thankfully, no one was seriously hurt, and James's \nunderstanding of how best to help others, shall we say, ``evolved'' \nover time.\n  A few years later, James found success on the football field. He soon \nbecame cocaptain of the Meade County High School varsity football team. \nHis drive on the field spilled over into the weight room, where he \nbroke several of his school's weightlifting records.\n  James's greatest moments on the field came his senior year with \nbrother B.J., then a sophomore, also on the team. James played \nfullback, blocking opponents and creating holes for his ball-carrying \nbrother, who played halfback. Over the course of the season, this one-\ntwo brotherly combination would amass an outstanding record. ``Our \nwhole community knew him because of [the] sports he played,'' B.J. said \nof his brother James.\n  Beyond the yards gained or the touchdowns scored, this portrait of \none brother leading the way for the other illustrated the relationship \nthe two shared throughout James's life. William Sherrill said:\n\n       B.J. always looked up to James. They were best friends. \n     Losing James has been particularly hard on B.J. . . . he's \n     more serious now.\n\n  James was a protector, not only for B.J. but for others he helped \nmentor, such as the children at his local church and his fellow \nsoldiers in Iraq. Given the choice between going to college or joining \nthe military, James opted for the Marines, where he expanded his \nskills, traveled the world, and developed his faith.\n\n  After completing his tour with the Marines, James returned home to \nEkron, where he decided to continue serving his country and joined the \nKentucky National Guard. He also became a student at Elizabethtown \nCommunity College, hoping to pursue a career in law enforcement, and he \nmet the love of his life.\n  James used his experience from the Marines to, as his father put it, \n``become a leader that everyone looked to.'' He always emphasized the \nimportance of being focused on the mission at hand to his squad. He \nconstantly double-checked his team to make sure they all knew their \nroles. James knew he and his fellow soldiers would be navigating some \nof the most deadly stretches of highway in the world.\n  Whenever he called home, however, he said the dangers of his job did \nnot worry him. James's father recalls that his son felt at peace with \nwhat he was doing, even though he knew he may never make it home. \nWilliam Sherrill attributes this serenity to his son's faith.\n  James reached his final resting place on April 12, 2005, in a small \nplot of land adjacent to the Zion Grove Baptist Church in Ekron. \nSergeant Sherrill was buried with full military honors. Later that \nafternoon, William Sherrill rested on the front porch of a neighbor's \nhome to reflect on the day's events.\n  Eventually, he looked up to see, stretched out across the sky, one of \nthe brightest rainbows he had ever witnessed. This magnificent rainbow \nseemed to spring up from the Sherrill family home, stretch into the \nsky, and then arc downward, delicately landing near the cemetery of \nZion Grove Baptist Church.\n  Every day when William Sherrill drives his truck home from work, his \nroute usually takes him past James's grave site. And every day he is \nsure to slow his vehicle and blow his son a gentle kiss.\n  I am grateful to William and Beatrice Sherrill today for sharing \ntheir stories of James with us. We are thinking of James's brother, \nB.J., today as well.\n  Across the Nation, other families understand the simple gesture of \nblowing a kiss, for they, too, have lost a loved one in the line of \nduty. As a nation, we all grieve with these families. Yet we feel a \nsense of pride as well; pride at\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\nthe notion that thousands of men and women of courage have volunteered \nto wear the uniform and face danger in order to protect America.\n  SGT James Sherrill demonstrated his courage twice over, first by \njoining the Marines, and again by joining the Kentucky National Guard. \nHis devotion and his sacrifice were a gift to the rest of us. We must \ntreasure that gift.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to keep the family of SGT James \nSherrill in their thoughts and prayers. They will certainly be in mine.\n\n\n                   lance corporal david gramesSanchez\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart and deep \nsense of gratitude to honor the life of a brave young man from Fort \nWayne. David GramesSanchez, twenty-two years old, was killed on May 11 \nin a tank wreck near Karmah, 50 miles west of Baghdad in the Anbar \nprovince. Leaving his life and family behind him, David risked \neverything to fight for the values Americans hold close to our hearts, \nin a land halfway around the world.\n  According to his family, joining the Marine Corps had been a lifelong \ndream of David's and he loved being in the Corps. An Elmhurst High \nSchool wrestler remembered for his infectious smile, David followed the \nfamily tradition of joining the service. Both his grandfathers had \nserved, and despite the objections of some of his relatives, David \nenlisted shortly after his high school graduation. His aunt told a \nlocal news outlet, ``I tried to talk him out of (joining the Marines) \nbecause I knew something might happen to him. But he was very \nindependent and loved his country. It seems apparent now that David was \ncalled by God and his country to lead a purpose-driven life. He wanted \nto make a difference.'' David was on his second tour of duty in Iraq \nwhen he was killed.\n  His death came as a second blow to his community, as David was the \nsecond graduate of his high school to die in Iraq. Six months ago, a \nroadside bomb attack killed Army Corporal Jonathan Blair, a 2002 \nElmhurst graduate.\n  David was killed while serving his country in Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. He was assigned to the 2nd Tank Battalion, 2nd Marine \nDivision, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, N.C. This brave \nsoldier leaves behind his wife, Lindsay Walsh; his 2-year-old son, \nCorbin; his father, David Grames, and father's fiancee, Lory Burton; \nhis mother, Guadalupe Sanchez; his sister, Emily Grames; and numerous \nother relatives.\n  Today, I join David's family and friends in mourning his death. While \nwe struggle to bear our sorrow over this loss, we can also take pride \nin the example he set, bravely fighting to make the world a safer \nplace. It is his courage and strength of character that people will \nremember when they think of David, a memory that will burn brightly \nduring these continuing days of conflict and grief.\n  David was known for his dedication to his family and his love of \ncountry. Today and always, David will be remembered by family members, \nfriends and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we honor the \nsacrifice he made while dutifully serving his country.\n  As I search for words to do justice in honoring David's sacrifice, I \nam reminded of President Lincoln's remarks as he addressed the families \nof the fallen soldiers in Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as I am certain \nthat the impact of David's actions will live on far longer that any \nrecord of these words.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of David GramesSanchez in the \nofficial Record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. When I \nthink about this just cause in which we are engaged, and the \nunfortunate pain that comes with the loss of our heroes, I hope that \nfamilies like David's can find comfort in the words of the prophet \nIsaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord \nGod will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with David.\n\n\n                   Sergeant Lonnie Calvin Allen, Jr.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to express my sympathy over the loss \nof Army SGT Lonnie Calvin Allen, Jr., from Nebraska. Sergeant Allen \ndied when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle \nwhile on patrol northwest of Baghdad on May 18. He was 26 years old.\n  Sergeant Allen grew up in Bellevue, NE, and graduated from Bellevue \nEast High School in 1998. After 2 years at Northeastern Junior College \nin Sterling, CO, he enlisted in the U.S. Army. After his first \nenlistment was completed, Sergeant Allen reenlisted and was deployed to \nIraq in August 2005. He was a member of the 10th Mountain Division \nbased out of Fort Drum, NY. Sergeant Allen will be remembered as a \nloyal soldier who had a strong sense of duty, honor, and love of \ncountry. Thousands of brave Americans such as Sergeant Allen are \ncurrently serving in Iraq.\n  Sergeant Allen is survived by his wife Birgit, and parents, Lonnie \nand Sallie Allen. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this \ndifficult time. America is proud of Sergeant Allen's heroic service and \nmourns his loss.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring Sergeant \nLonnie Calvin Allen, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4882-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNLV PRESIDENT CAROL HARTER\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \ncitizen from my home State, Dr. Carol C. Harter. As the longest serving \npresident in the history of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Carol \nhas brought a real vision for Nevada's future to her work and to our \ncommunities.\n  On June 30, 2006, Carol will step down president of the university \nand leave behind an extraordinary legacy of accomplishments. Under her \ndirection, the university created 100 degree programs. She was \ninstrumental in the creation of the William S. Boyd School of Law, the \nSchool of Architecture, and the School of Dental Medicine. She \nincreased the size of the university, adding to the number of \nbuildings, programs, students, and faculty. During Carol Harter's \ntenure as president, she raised over $556 million in gifts and pledges, \nwhich accounts for more than 80 percent of all gifts received since the \nUNLV Foundation's inception in 1982.\n  Carol brought a style of leadership to the university that was both \neffective and inspirational. Her strength, vision, and compelling \npersonality provided an example to her students, faculty, and the \ncommunity. I am well acquainted with her abilities because I have had \nthe privilege of working with her on numerous projects. One project \nthat has great meaning to me personally was the founding of the School \nof Dental Medicine. Growing up, my family did not have access to good \ndental care, and I know what a tremendous impact the dental school's \ncommunity outreach programs will have on families like mine.\n  Carol's dedication did more than simply benefit the university; her \nefforts improved the quality of life in Nevada. Under Carol's \nleadership, the university has grown to be an institution that attracts \nprofessionals and academics to Nevada, provides for a cultural meeting \nplace, trains the minds of all who come through its doors, and raises \nthe level of culture and society in our community. I wish her only the \nbest as she continues her career as executive director of the Black \nMountain Institute. Her many accomplishments as president of the \nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas, will benefit the university and the \nresidents of Nevada for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4882-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4882-S4883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL TRAILS DAY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nTrails Day, which will be celebrated on June 3. One of this country's \ngreatest natural treasures is its trails. Trails offer an opportunity \nfor people of all ages to recreate, exercise and explore the great \noutdoors. Oftentimes they are a reflection of our history--a link to \nour past that allows us to literally follow in the footsteps of those \nwho came before us.\n  Since its inception in 1993, National Trails Day has increased the \nawareness\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\nof trails in our communities, and it has also provided support to the \nvolunteer trail clubs that do so much to enhance the access and \nenjoyment of our trails. I extend my thanks to the volunteers who put \nforth so much time, passion and energy into maintaining the 200,000 \nmiles of trails we are fortunate to call our own.\n  The theme for this year's National Trails Day celebration is \n``Experience Your Outdoors.'' From hiking and climbing to biking and \nhorseback riding, there are many things we can do to experience our \noutdoors. I encourage all Americans to participate in National Trails \nDay and truly enjoy their outdoor experience.\n  I know that many of my fellow Nevadans will be enjoying National \nTrails Day this year with celebrations scheduled at The John Day Trail \nand the Greenhorn Cutoff of the California National Historic Trail in \nElko, The Pony Express Trail in Eureka, The Tahoe Rim Trail at Lake \nTahoe, Condor Canyon in Caliente and the Spring Mountains National \nRecreation Area in Las Vegas to name a few.\n  Nevada's trails are rich with history and uniquely beautiful. I \ninvite you all to visit Nevada's trails and experience all that they \nhave to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4883-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4883-S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS FOR SMALL \n                               BUSINESSES\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to have included in the Record \nstatements of support for S. 2588, the Health Care Access for Small \nBusinesses Act, from all across the state of Michigan. I am proud to \nhave support from organizations as diverse as providers, insurers, and \nelected officials.\n  The three share model is an innovative community-based concept that \nhas worked across the United States from California to Arkansas, of \ncourse, to Michigan. The name, ``three share'' stems from the program's \npayment structure. Premiums are shared between the employer who pays 30 \npercent, the employee who pays 30 percent and the community which \ncovers the remaining 40 percent of the cost.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the support letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Ascension Health,\n\n                                    St. Louis, MO, April 28, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I am writing in strong support of \n     the legislation you recently introduced, S. 2588, the \n     ``Health Care Access for Small Business Act of 2006,'' that \n     would expand health insurance coverage for employees who work \n     for small companies through a ``Three-Share Program'' modeled \n     on a successful initiative first developed in Michigan. As \n     you know, Ascension Health--through our sponsored hospitals \n     and heal systems in Michigan that include Standish Community \n     Hospital; Borgess Health Alliance in Kalamazoo; St. Joseph \n     Health System in Tawas City; Saint Mary's Medical Center in \n     Saginaw; Genesys Health System in Flint; and St. John Health \n     in Detroit--has a significant presence in Michigan. We \n     believe your legislation will help us in our work at the \n     local level in Michigan and across the country to achieve \n     100% access to health care.\n       Over the past 6 years, Ascension Health has fostered the \n     development of local community coalitions to expand access \n     and improve the quality of care provided to the uninsured. \n     Our experience led to the development of a 5 step model to \n     expand access to care. Step One is to build a formal \n     infrastructure that can support safety net services for the \n     uninsured. Step Two is to fill service gaps, such as dental \n     prescription drugs, and mental health services. Step Three is \n     to develop and implement a care model for the uninsured that \n     emphasizes coordinated services throughout the continuum of \n     care. Step Four is to recruit physicians to provide medical \n     homes and specialty care for the uninsured. Step Five is to \n     get funding to ensure the long term sustainability of the \n     initiative.\n       Since 2000, community coalitions in Michigan with an \n     Ascension Health partner have received over $11 million in \n     federal support through the Healthy Community Access Program \n     (HCAP) and approximately $2 million in matching funds from \n     Ascension Health. These funds have been used to develop and \n     implement many of the steps identified above to achieve 100% \n     access. We believe your legislation would help us reach the \n     final step of achieving long term sustainability by providing \n     small business, owners and their workers an opportunity to \n     afford insurance coverage.\n       We enthusiastically support your legislation. Please let us \n     know what we can do to further help you in your efforts to \n     expand coverage for the 47 million Americans without health \n     insurance, the additional 40 million Americans who go \n     uninsured during some part of the year, and the additional 80 \n     million Americans who are only partially covered.\n           Sincerely.\n                                               Athony R. Tersigni,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Upper Peninsula Health Plan,\n\n                                    Marquette, MI, April 20, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I am writing to express my \n     organization's support for Senator Stabenow's SB 2588, \n     ``Health Care Access for Small Business Act of 2006.'' SB \n     2588 will provide grants to eligible ``three-share programs'' \n     for the start-up and operation costs of providing specific \n     health care benefits to eligible covered individuals for a \n     period of five years.\n       A ``Three-Share Program'' is a basic plan for health care \n     coverage that brings together employers, workers without \n     health care coverage and outside funding to create a health \n     care coverage plan for those workers who have no other access \n     to health insurance. The plan encourages employers (formerly \n     not offering insurance coverage) to assist in the payment of \n     modest fees for their employees' health coverage. Additional \n     private, state, and/or federal funds are required to augment \n     fees paid by other parties to complete the reimbursement of \n     care. This transforms the ``slow pay/no pay'' patients into \n     ``assuredly-pay/discount-pay'' patients.\n       Presently in Michigan, 1.2 million people do not have \n     health care coverage. Sixty percent of the 1.2 million are \n     employed and work full or part-time. Fifty percent of the 1.2 \n     million are employed by small businesses and are not offered \n     health care benefits. Michigan has seen two successful and \n     separate community initiatives that began offering health \n     care coverage for employed, low-income persons using the \n     three-share model: HealthChoice in Wayne County (1994) and \n     Access Health in Muskegon County (1999). Both are received \n     grant monies for their start-up and operation costs.\n       The three-share program is a successful model for other \n     regions to replicate. However, without start-up seed money in \n     which to build community involvement, determine market needs, \n     and establish administrative systems to carry out operational \n     functions, these programs cannot get off the ground. In order \n     to begin solving the health care crisis on a local level, \n     communities need monetary supports in which to fund \n     initiatives such as three-share programs.\n       Michiganders want access to high-quality, affordable health \n     care. Thank you for initiating this legislation to help them \n     receive it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis H. Smith,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Trinity Health,\n\n                                           Novi, MI, May 12, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I am writing to congratulate and \n     thank you for your legislation, the Health Care Access for \n     Small Businesses Act of 2006, and to offer Trinity Health's \n     support and assistance in its passage.\n       As you know, Mercy General Health Partners, one of Trinity \n     Health's twelve hospitals in Michigan, was instrumental in \n     the creation of Access Health, one of the nation's most \n     successful community-initiated programs for the working \n     uninsured. Access Health now has a seven year track record. \n     We are proud to be associated with Access Health, and \n     appreciate your past contributions in helping to make it the \n     success that it is.\n       The Health Care Access for Small Businesses Act of 2006 \n     will help communities across the nation replicate the Access \n     Health model, and thus become an important piece of the \n     solution for the country's millions of uninsured individuals.\n       Specifically, your bill would leverage a federal \n     contribution with community funds to help small businesses \n     and their employees purchase a health coverage product \n     developed by the community. In addition to reducing the local \n     uninsured population, increased access to health care in a \n     community will result in community-wide economic benefit. \n     Employers in the community will experience less health care \n     cost-shifting, and increased productivity and employee \n     retention. With greater emphasis on preventive and chronic \n     care, communities' uninsured populations will become less of \n     a financial burden on state and local budgets.\n       Thank you for your very thoughtful effort to help \n     communities, small business, and to ensure that the uninsured \n     are not forgotten. We look forward to working with you on \n     this national effort.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Marsha J. Casey,\n     President, Michigan Ministries.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Detroit, MI, May 9, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I am writing to express Wayne \n     County's strong support for S. 2588, the Health Care Access \n     for Small Businesses Act of 2006. As you know, Wayne County, \n     Michigan has long been on the forefront of developing \n     innovative health coverage for small business employees and \n     the uninsured. Our experience demonstrates that\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\n     these programs have a meaningful impact on employee retention \n     and well-being and provide a much-needed safety net to scores \n     of workers in Wayne County. As such, we appreciate Senator \n     Stabenow's leadership and strongly support the authorization \n     of federal grant programs for pilot demonstrations that will \n     help ensure the establishment and the continued success of \n     three-share health coverage programs across the country.\n       The ``three-share'' programs developed in Wayne County \n     provide affordable coverage and quality medical care to \n     working uninsured residents. As you are aware, the two \n     primary three-share programs operating in Wayne County are \n     the Health Choice program and the Four Star Program. Under \n     both programs, workers receive coverage for primary health \n     care, prescription drugs, emergency and urgent care, hospital \n     care, and diagnostic services. Employers, employees, and the \n     County each pay roughly one-third of the premium cost of the \n     coverage, which is less than $60 per month for employees. \n     There are currently 607 employers, including 3,700 members, \n     participating in Health Choice and approximately 40 \n     businesses, including 150 members, participating in Four \n     Star.\n       These three-share programs not only provide coverage to \n     individuals who badly need it; but they also help small \n     businesses attract and retain skilled employees. In Wayne \n     County, roughly 280,000 persons are uninsured, many of whom \n     are employed by small businesses that cannot afford to bear \n     the cost of providing a health insurance benefit to their \n     employees. The three-share programs operating in Wayne County \n     provide these employers with a low-cost way of providing \n     health insurance to their workers, which in turn reduces sick \n     days, builds employee morale and loyalty, and ultimately \n     improves our local economy.\n       Federal grants that would be authorized by S. 2588 could \n     enable Wayne County to expand these programs to serve more \n     persons or include additional benefits. Currently, Wayne \n     County's three-share programs only cover employees and their \n     spouses, as the County is unable to provide coverage to the \n     children of employees. Funding could also support the \n     County's outreach efforts to eligible employers, including \n     reaching out to the Hispanic and Arab American communities to \n     ensure awareness of the program and how it operates. Finally, \n     it is possible that federal grant money would allow the \n     County, working with its underwriters to lower the portion of \n     premiums that employers have to pay, thus providing an \n     incentive to additional small businesses to participate in \n     the program. Numerous other counties would similarly benefit \n     from a federal grant program for three-share programs.\n       Wayne County's programs have enhanced access to health \n     services for the most needy in our community and we commend \n     your leadership and vision for seeking expanded nationwide \n     access to this model. We are confident other municipalities \n     will find your legislation attractive as well. Expanding \n     insurance opportunities for our nation's uninsured and \n     providing small businesses with a meaningful way of offering \n     health coverage to their employees are significant challenges \n     to many, if not most, municipalities. Three-share programs \n     can positively impact other counties and cities nationwide so \n     that both employers and employees benefit from the continued \n     strength of these programs. Thank you again for all your \n     leadership and all your efforts to address pressing national \n     health coverage access problems.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert A. Ficano,\n     Wayne County Executive.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     Oakwood Healthcare, Inc.,\n\n                                       Dearborn, MI, May 16, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: Thank you for introducing Senate \n     Bill 2588 that certifies and supports programs to provide \n     uninsured employees of small businesses access to health \n     coverage.\n       As the Chief Executive Officer of a health system in a \n     market experiencing high unemployment and increasing numbers \n     of uninsured patients among the employed, I am hearing of \n     many individuals avoiding visits to their healthcare provider \n     due to lack of insurance. This has resulted in significant \n     decreases in hospital admissions in Southeast Michigan during \n     the past six months.\n       Of course, the underlying health problems of these \n     uninsured individuals are not going away. We fully expect to \n     see many of them in our Emergency Room when their condition \n     reaches a crisis stage.\n       While the problem of the uninsured is entrenched and \n     growing, there are potential solutions. Our governor in \n     Michigan is working to create a statewide plan that would \n     cover significant numbers of uninsured residents. While we \n     support this work, we also believe that development of shared \n     resource insurance programs could very quickly begin \n     addressing the problem in a number of local markets.\n       Oakwood has already established one such program, known as \n     the ``Four-Star'' health plan, in which Oakwood Healthcare \n     System, St. John Health System, Henry Ford Health System, and \n     the Detroit Medical Center, partner with the Wayne County \n     Health Department to provide coverage to qualified \n     individuals who share the cost with their employer and the \n     county.\n       We believe this program and others like it offer a timely \n     and viable approach to providing health care access to the \n     uninsured employed by small businesses. It is exactly the \n     approach described in S. 2588.\n       We welcome the support this bill would provide to build and \n     market plans like ours. While we believe such three-share \n     plans offer the right solution to many employers and their \n     employees, they require significant startup investment. The \n     grants called for in Section 2201 would do much to encourage \n     additional three-share programs, thus providing access to \n     health care for thousands of employed individuals while \n     adding to the viability and competitiveness of many small \n     businesses. We heartily endorse passage of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Gerald D. Fitzgerald,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    www.CoverTheUninsured.org,\n\n                                        Dearborn, MI, May 2, 2006.\n     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stabenow: I want to thank you for developing \n     and introducing the ``Health Care Access for Small Businesses \n     Act of 2006.'' I support efforts to expand coverage for the \n     uninsured, and I am pleased that your legislation is modeled \n     on the successful multi-share program in Muskegon that \n     provides affordable health insurance options for small \n     businesses. It is this kind of program that should be \n     replicated to reduce the number of working uninsured in our \n     country.\n       I hope you will find other ways to bring the urgent issue \n     of the uninsured to the forefront of the national political \n     agenda. Nearly 46 million Americans are living without health \n     insurance, including more than 8 million children. As you \n     know, more and more Michigan families are facing the hardship \n     of being uninsured as cutbacks in manufacturing leave them \n     unemployed or in jobs without health benefits.\n       The economic impact of the growing uninsured is most \n     evident for states and localities like ours trying to attract \n     job-creating investments. Small businesses often find that \n     insurance coverage for their employees is either unaffordable \n     or simply unavailable. Large employers that do provide health \n     insurance are bearing many of the uninsured treatment costs, \n     which are shifted to them through steeply rising premiums. \n     The result is an uneven playing field for employers.\n       More importantly, the uninsured often receive care that is \n     ``too little too late.'' Minor illnesses become more severe \n     because care is delayed. The Institute of Medicine has \n     determined that thousands of uninsured people die each year \n     because of this delayed care.\n       I hope you will work to find bipartisan support for the \n     ``Health Care Access for Small Businesses Act of 2006,'' and \n     that you can continue to support other legislative \n     initiatives on behalf of the uninsured. ``Coverage and access \n     for all'' makes economic sense because it will mean more \n     efficient and effective care, a healthier population, and a \n     more competitive local economy. More importantly, coverage \n     and access for all is the right thing to do for our \n     community. In a just society, no one should be left behind.\n       Thank you for your efforts on behalf of the uninsured.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stanley Goldberg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4884-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4884-S4885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nIN RECOGNITION OF 40 YEARS OF FAITHFUL SERVICE TO THE ELIEZER CHURCH OF \n                         OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST\n\n   Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize two distinguished religious leaders in \nMichigan, Pastor Raymond H. Dunlap, Sr. and his wife, Mother Lillian B. \nDunlap. On May 21, 2006, they will be honored for their service to The \nEliezer Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ of Flint, MI.\n  Bishop Dunlap, known by many as a ``Man with a Vision,'' entered the \nministry in Columbus, OH in 1954 under the guidance of his father, the \nlate Bishop Sandy Dunlap. In 1966, he became the pastor of the newly \nestablished Eliezer Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ in Flint, MI. \nBishop Dunlap was appointed district elder of the Northern District in \n1977 and 3 years later was named junior bishop at the International \nConvocation. Bishop Dunlap's faithfulness, leadership, and service lead \nhim to be consecrated bishop in 1983. Bishop Dunlap directed the \ncreation of 13 Churches of the Lord Jesus Christ in Michigan, as well \nas 3 in Minnesota.\n  Over the years, Bishop Dunlap has founded several programs, including \nthe Michigan Home Builders, the Apostolic Instructions Deliverance \nStation, and Anti-Juvenile Delinquency. He also organized the Freedom \nTrain Outreach and was editor of the International Church of Our Lord \nJesus Christ of the Apostolic Faith. Through these community-based \nefforts, Bishop Dunlap\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nhas provided much needed assistance and leadership to those most in \nneed.\n  Bishop Dunlap's wife, Mother Dunlap, has dedicated a great deal of \nher service to youth ministry. Her work with the Youth Department, \nSunday School Department, Music Department, as well as the Church of \nOur Lord Jesus Christ Bible Institute Extension has allowed her to \ntouch the lives of children and adults alike. In addition, she has \nministered her faith through several literary contributions, including \n``Words From the Lord For the Women,'' ``Go To Sleep With Mother's \nPrayer,'' and ``Mountain Top Prayers.'' Mother Dunlap's faith has been \nan inspiration not only to her church but to the entire community.\n  Bishop and Mother Dunlap have delivered their spiritual message \nthrough radio ministry for several years. Bishop Dunlap ministers \nthrough ``The Hour of Power, for Prayer or to Share''. Mother Dunlap \nextends her message through ``The Extension of the Hour of Power--Sleep \nWell With Mother's Prayer.''\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Bishop Dunlap and \nMother Dunlap on their service to the Flint community and on their many \nachievements over the years. I am pleased to offer my best wishes to \nthem on the 40 years of faithful service at the Eliezer Church of Our \nLord Jesus Chris and for many more years of good health, happiness, and \nservice to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4885-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MUNSTER HIGH SCHOOL RECEIVES WE THE PEOPLE CENTRAL STATES REGION AWARD\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Munster \nHigh School's We the People class on being awarded the Central States \nRegion Award at the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution \nnational competition held April 29-May 1 in Washington, DC. I am \npleased that the members of the Munster High School We the People class \nwere among the 1,200 students from across the country that participated \nin this important event specifically designed to educate young people \nabout the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.\n  I join family, friends, and the entire Munster High School community \nin recognizing the hard work and dedication of the following members of \nthe Munster High School We the People class: Sara Brown, Sara Farooq, \nScott Goodwin, Lauren Hudak, Hannah Huebner, Casey Jedrzejczak, Alexis \nJeter, Joseph Kasenga, Emily Lyness, Shobha Pai, Samantha Skrobot, and \nMatt Westerlund. I also wish to commend Michael Gordon, the teacher of \nthe class, who committed his time and talent to prepare the students \nfor the national competition.\n  The success of the Indiana We the People program is also attributed \nto the hard work of Erin Braun and others at the Indiana Bar \nAssociation, as well as Stan Harris and Cathy Bomberger.\n  The We the People national competition is a 3-day academic \ncompetition that simulates a congressional hearing in which the \nstudents ``testify'' before a panel of judges on constitutional topics. \nStudents are able to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of \nconstitutional principles as they evaluate and defend positions on \nrelevant historical and contemporary issues.\n  The We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program is \nadministered by the Center for Civic Education and funded by the U.S. \nDepartment of Education through congressional appropriations. I am \nproud to note that between 2002 and 2005, Indiana had 147,497 students \nparticipate in the programs offered through the Center for Civic \nEducation, with 7,074,896 participating nationally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4885-2", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5385.

With crude \n     oil prices hitting $75 per barrel--an increase of more than \n     40 percent in less than a year--the country faces a great \n     challenge. While there are numerous factors behind the \n     escalating prices of oil to record levels, there are valid \n     concerns across the country that there could be instances in \n     which prices are being artificially increased in some \n     situations because of activities that are not related solely \n     to market forces; and\n       Whereas, the path from the oil field to the consumer is a \n     long one. Refining, distribution, marketing, and storage are \n     all processes that must operate above suspicion in order to \n     assure the American people that the prices they pay are \n     honest. Worries over price gouging, collusion, or other \n     illegal activities can seriously undermine the public's \n     trust; and\n       Whereas, it is essential that all efforts be made to ensure \n     integrity in this critically important element of our \n     economy. The United States Attorney General and the Federal \n     Trade Commission should take the lead in protecting the \n     public from illegal activities. This vigilance must extend to \n     refining; transportation of fuel by pipelines, marine \n     vessels, and trucks; storage and marketing, including at the \n     wholesale level; and commodity trading; and\n       Whereas, American consumers have every right to expect that \n     markets are fair and that their governmental agencies and \n     personnel are doing all they can to eliminate all illegal \n     activities, including artificial spot shortages; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     respectfully request the President of the United States to \n     direct the United States Attorney General and the Chairman of \n     the Federal Trade Commission to investigate all potential \n     price gouging, price fixing, collusion, and other \n     anticompetitive practices related to gasoline prices; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Office of the President of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-324, A concurrent resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Louisiana \n     relative to taking such actions as are necessary to formulate \n     a sound energy policy that will provide for the long-term \n     economic and national security needs of the United States of \n     America; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 116\n\n       Whereas, a constant, dependable supply of affordable energy \n     is absolutely essential to the continued success and well-\n     being of our nation; and\n       Whereas, the provision of adequate energy supplies is \n     dependent on a rational energy policy which promotes \n     conservation, prevents unreasonable taxation that would \n     inhibit the competitiveness of United States energy producers \n     against foreign-owned firms, and allows the full development \n     of domestic energy sources in an ecologically sound manner; \n     and\n       Whereas, the windfall profits tax has proven itself to be \n     an impediment to domestic energy production, a barrier to the \n     competitiveness of United States energy companies in the \n     world market, and an unfair penalty on investors; and\n       Whereas, the windfall profits tax is a direct cause of \n     unnecessarily high retail energy prices and increased \n     dependence on foreign oil; and\n       Whereas, our national security and economic growth is \n     imperiled by our growing dependence on foreign energy \n     supplies, which could be reduced by the development of a wide \n     array of domestic energy sources; and\n       Whereas, the exploration and development of all viable \n     energy reserves in the United States is critical not only to \n     our national economy but also to the redevelopment of the \n     Gulf Coast economies decimated by natural disaster; and\n       Whereas, a report by the Investors Action Foundation \n     indicates that a windfall profits tax would have a severe, \n     negative economic impact on public employee trust funds which \n     could lose as much as two hundred fifty-one million dollars a \n     year in foregone gains; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take, with all due \n     haste, such actions as are necessary to formulate a sound \n     energy policy that will provide for the long-term economic \n     and national security needs of the United States of America, \n     which actions should include opposing any effort to establish \n     a windfall profits tax; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-325. A House Joint Memorial adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Idaho relative to demanding that the Federal \n     Lands Recreation Act be repealed and that no recreational \n     fees authorized under the Federal Lands Recreation \n     Enhancement Act be imposed to use federal public lands in the \n     state; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      House Joint Memorial No. 14\n\n       Whereas, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, H.R. \n     3283, 108th United States Congress, was introduced in the \n     United States House of Representatives and would have \n     authorized the United States Forest Service, the United \n     States Bureau of Land Management, the United States Fish and \n     Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, and the United \n     States Bureau of Reclamation to charge visitor fees for \n     recreation on publicly owned lands; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 3283 was not voted on separately in the \n     United States House of Representatives and was not introduced \n     in, did not have hearings in, and was not approved by the \n     United States Senate, but instead was attached to the omnibus \n     spending bill, H.R. 4818, by the 108th United States \n     Congress, as an appropriation rider; and\n       Whereas, the 108th United States Congress enacted H.R. \n     4818, and the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act is now \n     codified as 16 U.S.C. sections 6801 through 6814; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act \n     includes criminal penalties and is substantive legislation \n     that fundamentally changes the way public land in the state \n     is funded and managed; and\n       Whereas, the concept of paying fees to use public land is \n     contrary to the idea that public land belongs to the people \n     of the state and is land where every person is granted access \n     and is welcome, a concept that has been and should remain in \n     place; and\n       Whereas, recreational fees constitute double taxation and \n     bear no relationship to the actual costs associate with \n     recreational use such as hiking, picnicking, observing \n     wildlife, or scenic driving on state roads and public rights-\n     of-way; and\n       Whereas, the fees imposed by the Federal Lands Recreation \n     Enhancement Act are a regressive tax that places an undue \n     burden on the people living in rural areas adjacent to or \n     surrounded by large areas of federal land and discriminates \n     against lower-income and working Idahoans by placing \n     financial obstacles in the way of their enjoyment of public \n     land; and\n       Whereas, the public land access fees in the Federal Lands \n     Recreation Enhancement Act are controversial and are opposed \n     by hundreds of organizations, several state legislatures and \n     millions of rural Americans; and\n       Whereas, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act \n     establishes an interagency pass that may be used to cover \n     entrance fees and recreational amenity fees for federal \n     public land and water, disregarding the substantially \n     different ways in which national parks and other federal \n     public land are managed and funded; and\n       Whereas, the limited means of expressing opposition to and \n     the lack of public debate in the implementation of the fee \n     program raises the concern that some citizens may be deterred \n     from visiting and enjoying public land in the state and \n     throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas, tourism is an important industry to the state, and \n     the imposition of recreational use fees will have a negative \n     effect\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\n     on state and local economies; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, By the members of the Second Regular Session of \n     the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate concurring therein, that the \n     Legislature of the State of Idaho demands that the Federal \n     Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, which was enacted on \n     December 8, 2004, be repealed and that no recreational fees \n     authorized under the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act \n     be imposed to use federal public land in the state; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed \n     to forward a copy of this Memorial to be sent to the \n     Honorable George W.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Michigan relative to memorializing the President of the \n     United States and the United States Congress to take prompt \n     action to provide relief from high gas prices; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 61\n\n       Whereas, the average price for unleaded regular gasoline is \n     71 cents per gallon higher than this time last year; and\n       Whereas, this is the highest price gasoline has been since \n     immediately after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The President \n     has instructed the Federal Trade Commission, the Justice \n     Department, and the Energy Department to investigate whether \n     the price of gasoline has been unfairly manipulated; and\n       Whereas, the average price for a barrel of oil recently \n     topped $75.00 for the first time in history. The President \n     has called on Congress to take back some of the billions of \n     dollars in tax incentives given to energy companies that are \n     not needed in the face of record profits due to high oil \n     prices; and\n       Whereas, this per-barrel price is approaching the \n     inflation-adjusted highs of the late 1970s and early 1980s; \n     and\n       Whereas, Michigan's manufacturing, agricultural, and \n     tourism economies are negatively impacted by rising fuel \n     costs; and\n       Whereas, the Legislature appropriated funds for the \n     Department of Agriculture to add Motor Fuel Quality \n     inspectors and to increase the number of gas pump inspections \n     in the state of Michigan. These inspections help decrease the \n     chance that consumers are being gouged at the pump and should \n     continue so that our citizens get what they pay for; and\n       Whereas, there are many factors that have contributed to \n     the recent rise in gasoline pump prices. A significant \n     element is the dozens of gasoline formulations that \n     refineries must produce to meet environmental standards \n     nationwide, as well as the switch from winter to summer \n     gasoline blends; and\n       Whereas, to address these concerns, the President has \n     ordered a temporary suspension of environmental rules for \n     gasoline so that refineries can meet consumer demand more \n     cost effectively, which should in turn dampen prices at the \n     pump; and\n       Whereas, while our nation's refining capacity has been \n     stagnant for 30 years, our total energy demand has increased \n     by 40 percent. This is due in part to the problems of a large \n     bureaucratic permitting process that has made it extremely \n     difficult to site and construct new refineries; and\n       Whereas, new refineries could increase gasoline supplies \n     and lower gasoline prices for consumers. It may be helpful \n     for Michigan to identify what state government barriers exist \n     that hamper our ability to site new refineries or to enhance \n     our existing refinery capacity; and\n       Whereas, legislation to support increased exploration and \n     production of domestic oil and gas reserves has been debated \n     by Congress. Such development would decrease our dependence \n     on foreign sources of oil and meet the nation's future energy \n     needs; and\n       Whereas, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established to \n     guard against any major supply disruption. The President \n     ordered the deferment of deposits into the reserve to leave \n     more oil on the market to meet consumer demand, which should \n     in turn dampen prices at the pump; and\n       Whereas, one approach to solving America's energy problems \n     is to invest in alternative forms of energy. The President \n     signed the National Energy Policy Act of 2005, which \n     authorizes billions of dollars to promote the production and \n     use of alternative transportation fuels and to enhance \n     domestic energy production. By supporting the production and \n     use of ethanol, biodiesel, and other alternative fuels, our \n     nation will enhance its security by becoming less dependent \n     on foreign sources of oil, Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the United States \n     Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade \n     Commission to immediately investigate all potential price \n     gouging, price fixing, and other anti-competitive practices \n     related to gasoline prices as directed by the President of \n     the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Congress to act on the \n     President's call to roll back government assistance and tax \n     breaks for oil companies; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we support the President's actions to \n     temporarily suspend environmental rules for gasoline to more \n     quickly and efficiently make the switch to summer gasoline \n     and thereby dampen gasoline prices at the pump; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to increase efforts to \n     decrease the nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy \n     by increasing domestic oil and gas exploration and \n     production; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we support the President's actions to defer \n     deposits into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which could \n     increase supply and dampen prices at the pump; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the President of the United \n     States and the United States Congress to increase their \n     support for the development of alternative forms of energy, \n     including ethanol, biodiesel, blended fuels, and other \n     alternative fuels; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Governor to divest state \n     investments in oil companies that she feels have made \n     unseemly profits; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Governor to investigate \n     why it took more than a year and a half for her \n     administration to utilize money provided by the Legislature \n     to increase gasoline pump inspections and deploy new \n     inspectors in a proactive manner. Michigan consumers continue \n     to overpay by hundreds of millions of dollars at the pump \n     while the administration continues a reactive inspection \n     program rather than a proactive inspection program that could \n     protect consumers from paying for more gas than they are \n     receiving; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Governor to instruct the \n     Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to examine \n     Michigan regulations to identify barriers to increasing \n     refinery capacity in Michigan and to make recommendations to \n     lower and remove such barriers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we memorialize the Governor to investigate \n     the barriers to the redevelopment of Michigan oil and gas \n     reserves and to make recommendations to lower and remove such \n     barriers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the members of the Michigan congressional \n     delegation, and the Office of the Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-327.

to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 90\n\n       Whereas, in December 2005, the Social Security \n     Administration changed its procedures for accepting \n     ``evidence of age'' for newborns; and\n       Whereas, the Social Security Administration is required to \n     independently verify all documents submitted by United States \n     born individuals requesting an original social security card \n     unless the request for a social security number is submitted \n     through the enumeration at birth process; and\n       Whereas, according to the Social Security Administration, \n     independent verification requires contacting the hospital \n     where the child was born to determine whether a document \n     submitted by an applicant is authentic; and\n       Whereas, prior to Hurricane Katrina most newborns in \n     Louisiana were issued social security numbers through \n     Louisiana's enumeration at birth process; and\n       Whereas, birth certificates were filed with the Louisiana \n     Office of Vital Records by Louisiana hospitals shortly after \n     birth; and\n       Whereas, if requested by the parents, the Louisiana Office \n     of Vital Records would provide the Social Security \n     Administration\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\n     with the necessary information used to issue social security \n     numbers; and\n       Whereas, since Hurricane Katrina, the Louisiana Office of \n     Vital Records has experienced severe disruption in services \n     including the ability to process birth certificates; and\n       Whereas, consequently, many infants born prior to, during, \n     and after Hurricane Katrina have not been issued social \n     security numbers through the enumeration at birth process; \n     and\n       Whereas, since it is unknown when the Louisiana Office of \n     Vital Records will return to normal operations and the \n     enumeration at birth process is fully restored, parents have \n     begun applying for social security numbers for their newborns \n     at local social security offices throughout the state; and\n       Whereas, prior to the new social security regulations, \n     parents could use an original verification of birth issued by \n     the hospital, as evidence of age, to apply for a social \n     security number for their newborns; and\n       Whereas, with the new social security requirements, the \n     social security office must independently verify with \n     hospitals the authenticity of each verification of birth \n     given; and\n       Whereas, this new requirement mandates that hospital staff \n     spend extreme amounts of time re-verifying the birth of every \n     infant applying for a social security number; and\n       Whereas, since Hurricane Katrina, Woman's Hospital alone \n     has delivered more than three thousand five hundred infants: \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the Social Security Administration to accept \n     a notarized document to suffice as independent verification \n     for evidence of age;

\n     and\n       Whereas, Congress passed the Temporary Assistance for Needy \n     Families (TANF) Emergency Response and Recovery Act of 2005 \n     to give host states access to two billion dollars to help \n     hurricane victims scattered across the country due to the \n     results of the recent hurricanes;

and\n       Whereas, this act allows host states providing services to \n     evacuees to apply for contingency funds until August 31, \n     2006; and\n       Whereas, more than five months after the contingency funds \n     were set aside for host states to access, few states have \n     requested the additional aid; and\n       Whereas, billions of unclaimed dollars of federal disaster \n     aid for Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita evacuees go \n     unused even when many of those affected are still in need of \n     immediate assistance; and\n       Whereas, the unclaimed and unused federal disaster aid \n     funds could be put to immediate use in the hurricane ravaged \n     states to meet the needs of many families and improve their \n     lives; Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to redirect and make \n     available to Louisiana federal Contingency funds that were \n     set aside through the Temporary Assistance For Needy Families \n     (TANF) Emergency Response and Recovery Act of2005 to be drawn \n     by states receiving and hosting residents of Louisiana, \n     Alabama, and Mississippi that were displaced by Hurricane \n     Katrina and Hurricane Rita which remain unused;

The \n     founders believed that well-educated citizens were crucial to \n     a free society; and\n       Whereas, Citizens of the twenty-first century face \n     unprecedented challenges, including adapting to widely \n     diverse communities and workplaces, economic competition on a \n     global scale, applying rapidly evolving technologies, \n     managing scarce natural resources, and revolving political \n     and cultural conflicts; and\n       Whereas, The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 requires \n     rigorous assessment of the core academic subject of reading, \n     mathematics, and science. Success in dealing with the \n     challenges of the twenty-first century require mastering the \n     core disciplines of the social sciences, including civics, \n     government, economics, history, and geography, as well as \n     reading, mathematics, and science; and\n       Whereas, Assessing or measuring proficiency in some but not \n     all of the academic subjects necessary for a successful \n     education results in a lack of equitable measurement data of \n     student achievement. This limits accountability for the \n     responsible delivery of the untested academic subjects as \n     well as leading to less instructional attention, fewer \n     resources, and less emphasis on the social studies \n     curriculum: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the United \n     States Congress to add civics, government, economics, \n     history, and geography to the testing requirements of the No \n     Child Left Behind Act of 2001; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-336.

Meth abuse \n     is causing social, economic, and environmental problems. \n     Children residing in homes with meth labs live in danger and \n     often suffer from neglect and abuse. Meth production costs \n     citizens and governments millions of dollars for a variety of \n     reasons, including law enforcement costs, drug treatment for \n     offenders, cleanup of production sites, and placement of \n     endangered children; and\n       Whereas, Meth labs leave behind a toxic mess of chemicals \n     and pose a significant danger to communities. The manufacture \n     of one pound of methamphetamine results in six pounds of \n     waste. These wastes include corrosive liquids, acid vapors, \n     heavy metals, solvents, and other harmful materials that can \n     disfigure skin or cause death. Hazardous materials from meth \n     labs are typically disposed of illegally and may cause severe \n     damage to the environment; and\n       Whereas, Between 1992 and 2004, the number of clandestine \n     meth lab-related cleanups increased from 394 to over 10,000 \n     nationwide. The cost of cleaning up clandestine labs in FY \n     2004 was approximately $17.8 million; and\n       Whereas, States and local governments are bearing the \n     burden of funding the clean up efforts. Many local \n     communities are finding and seizing meth labs. But the lab \n     sites remain dangerous to the public because neither the \n     state or the local community has adequate funding to clean \n     them up; and\n       Whereas, Federal funding that is supposed to help states \n     and local communities bear the burden of cleaning up meth \n     labs is narrowly crafted and many states and local \n     communities are finding it difficult to qualify; and\n       Whereas, Federal legislation, such as the Clean, Learn, \n     Educate, Abolish, Neutralize, and Undermine Production \n     (CLEAN-UP) of Methamphetamines Act, introduced in the United \n     States House of Representatives, and the Combat Meth Act of \n     2005, introduced in the United States Senate, contain funding \n     for meth lab cleanup; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to provide funding for \n     meth lab clean up and ensure that the criteria to qualify for \n     the funds is broad enough that states and local communities \n     in the midst of the meth epidemic can access the funds; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-337. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to using flexibility in the implementation of rules \n     to allow use of an enhanced drivers license under the Western \n     Hemisphere Travel Initiative which requires all citizens of \n     any age of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda to \n     have a passport or other secure documentation to enter or re-\n     enter the United States; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 188\n\n       Whereas, The Michigan-Canada crossing is the busiest border \n     crossing in North America, including commerce, tourism, \n     trade, workers, and students, averaging hundreds of millions \n     of dollars in trade value per day in Michigan alone and \n     hundreds of billions of dollars per year across the entire \n     northern border. There are 10 land ports of entry between \n     Canada and Michigan, and in 2004 over 21 million passenger \n     vehicles crossed at just five of those ports. In 2004, there \n     were 58,000 daily border crossings to and from Michigan and \n     Canada; and\n       Whereas, The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative is a \n     proposal developed by the United States Department of \n     Homeland Security and the United States Department of State, \n     to require that all citizens of any age entering or re-\n     entering the United States from Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda, \n     have in their possession a passport or other secure \n     documentation as the only acceptable documentation required \n     by law as of December 31, 2007; and\n       Whereas, This proposal could have a devastating economic \n     impact on Michigan by slowing commerce and tourism. The \n     costly ($97 for each adult and $82 for each child) and \n     cumbersome process of obtaining a passport may discourage \n     many families, entrepreneurs, and tourists from traveling \n     across the border. Many residents in border regions would be \n     discouraged from taking spontaneous trips across the border. \n     It is projected that the total number of persons crossing the \n     border would decline, subsequently causing financial \n     difficulties for bridge and tunnel operators along the border \n     who largely depend on toll revenue to undertake maintenance \n     and improvement projects. It is estimated that the impact of \n     this policy would be economically devastating to Michigan \n     because Canada remains Michigan's primary export market, with \n     $175 billion worth of merchandise goods exchanged during 2004 \n     alone; and\n       Whereas, This proposal could end an 80-year period of trust \n     between the United\n\n[[Page S4891]]\n\n     States and Canada that allowed for seamless cross-border \n     trade and travel and the opportunity for education and \n     employment exchanges; and\n       Whereas, Protecting our borders is critical to ensuring \n     homeland security, and alternative means of establishing a \n     traveler's identity and nationality should be thoroughly \n     examined by the Departments of Homeland Security and State. \n     One such alternative that would be much cheaper and less \n     cumbersome could involve an identification code on driver's \n     licenses issued in Michigan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the President and the Congress of the United \n     States to use flexibility in the implementation of rules to \n     allow use of an enhanced drivers license under the Western \n     Hemisphere Travel Initiative which requires all citizens of \n     any age of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Bermuda to \n     have a passport or other secure documentation to enter or re-\n     enter the United States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-338. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to enacting legislation restricting protests at \n     funerals; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 226\n\n       Whereas, More than 100 military funerals nationwide have \n     been besieged with protesters in the past three years. \n     Protesters have trespassed on the solitude and dignity of \n     grieving families, who want nothing more than to bury their \n     husbands, wives, sons, and daughters in peace and solemnity. \n     Espousing perverse and hateful language and placards, these \n     protesters celebrate the slaying of our nation's heroes; and\n       Whereas, No family member, on the blackest day of their \n     life, should have to confront such premeditated viciousness, \n     which is solely calculated to deepen the anguish of \n     bereavement. Under such circumstances, the family's right to \n     privacy outweighs any supposed free speech concerns; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress is considering \n     legislation to restrict protests at funerals at national \n     cemeteries for 60 minutes before or after a funeral. The \n     measure would also restrict protesters to remain 500 feet or \n     more from the grave site or from individuals they are \n     protesting: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the United States Congress to enact legislation \n     restricting protests at funerals; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4891-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n        By Mr. GRASSLEY for the Committee on Finance.\n       *Susan C.

A bill to amend title IV of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to establish a Director of the Pension Benefit \nGuaranty Corporation and the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to increase \ncertain penalties, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, to introduce a bill making the \nposition of executive director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, or the PBGC, subject to the advice and consent of the \nSenate.\n  Quite frankly, I was surprised to find out that this important \nposition is not subject to Senate approval. The Secretary of Labor, the \nChairman of the PBGC, simply appoints the executive director. This is \ntoo important a position not to be subject to Senate oversight.\n  Jurisdiction over the PBGC rests with both the Committee on Finance \nand the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the HELP \nCommittee. To recognize this, our bill would require both committees to \napprove the director.\n  The Finance Committee, the HELP Committee, and indeed the entire \nSenate have spent considerable time over the last few years fighting to \nprotect the pensions of millions of workers. And the deficit of the \nPBGC--now over $23 billion--has been growing.\n  We now have a bill in conference that I hope will be brought back \nbefore the Senate soon. And I hope that the simple provision that I am \nintroducing today can be added to that legislation.\n  It is the perfect time to make the position subject to Senate \napproval. The current executive director is leaving the PBGC at the end \nof May. And his replacement should be subject to Senate confirmation.\n  The PBGC is a government corporation that was created when ERISA was \nenacted in 1974. It is established within the Department of Labor. \nLabor controls PBGC for many administrative matters. But PBGC has its \nown budget, which goes through the PBGC Board, and PBGC's attorneys \nlitigate their own cases. PBGC is controlled by a 3-person Board made \nup of the Secretary of Labor, as the Chairman of the PBGC, and the \nSecretaries of the Treasury and Commerce.\n  PBGC is run on a day-to-day basis by an executive director. This \nposition is not mentioned in ERISA but is a creation of the PBGC by-\nlaws adopted by the board. The Secretary of Labor appoints the \nexecutive director, who is a political appointee. Executive directors \nhave stayed on average a couple of years.\n  The PBGC insures the pensions of 40 million workers and retirees in \nabout 30,000 plans. These plans have trillions of dollars in assets. \nPBGC itself has more than $40 billion in assets, more than $63 billion \nin liabilities, and a $23 billion deficit. Even with the rush to \nterminate or freeze current plans, most of the Nation's biggest \ncompanies still maintain defined benefit plans. What happens with \ndefined benefit plans has a big effect on America's competitiveness and \naffects the retirement security of America's workers and retirees.\n  Making the executive director's position an advice and consent \nposition would give the Senate say in what type of person serves in \nthis position so that PBGC does not become another FEMA. It would show \nthe importance that Congress attaches to the role of the PBGC for \nworkers, retirees and employers. It would raise the attraction of the \nPBGC director position.\n  I ask my colleagues to support making the PBGC executive director \nposition subject to Senate approval.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2919\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to eliminate \nsecurity risks by replacing the use of extremely hazardous gaseous \nchemicals with inherently safer technologies; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Community \nWater Treatment Hazards Reduction Act of 2006. This legislation would \ncompletely eliminate a known security risk to millions of Americans \nacross the United States by facilitating the transfer to safer \ntechnologies from deadly toxic chemicals at our Nation's water \ntreatment facilities.\n  Across our Nation, there are thousands of water treatment facilities \nthat utilize gaseous toxic chemicals to treat drinking and wastewater. \nApproximately 2,850 facilities are currently regulated under the Clean \nAir Act because they store large, quantities of these dangerous \nchemicals. In fact, 98 of these facilities threaten over 100,000 \ncitizens. For example, the Fiveash Water Treatment Plant in Fort \nLauderdale, FL threatens 1,526,000 citizens. The Bachman Water \nTreatment in Dallas, TX threatens up to 2,000,000 citizens. And there \nare similar examples in communities throughout the Nation. If these \nfacilities--and the 95 other facilities that threaten over 100,000 \ncitizens--switched from the use of toxic chemicals to safer \ntechnologies that are widely used within the industry we could \ncompletely eliminate a known threat to nearly 50 million Americans.\n  Many facilities have already made the prudent decision to switch \nwithout intervention by government. The Middlesex County Utilities \nAuthority in Sayreville, NJ, switched to safer technologies and \neliminated the risk to 10.7 million people. The Nottingham Water \nTreatment Plant in Cleveland, OH switched and eliminated the risk to \n1.1 million citizens. The Blue Plains Wastewater Treatment Plant \nswitched and eliminated the risk to 1.7 million people. In my hometown \nof Wilmington, DE, the Wilmington Water Pollution Control Facility \nswitched from using chlorine gas to liquid bleach. This commendable \ndecision has eliminated the risk to 560,000 citizens, including the \nentire city of Wilmington. In fact, this facility no longer has to \nsubmit risk management plans to the Environmental Protection Agencies \nrequired by the Clean Air Act because the threat has been completely \neliminated. There are many other examples of facilities that have done \nthe right thing and eliminated the use of these dangerous, gaseous \nchemicals.\n  The bottom line is that if we can eliminate a known-risk, we should. \nThe legislation I am introducing today will do just that. It will \nrequire the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, to do a few \nsimple things. First, water facilities will be prioritized based upon \nthe risk that they pose to citizens and critical infrastructure. These \nfacilities--beginning with the most dangerous ones--will be required to \nsubmit a report on the feasibility of utilizing safer technologies and \nthe anticipated costs to transition. If grant funding is available, the \nAdministrator will issue a grant and order the facility to transition \nto the safer technology chosen by the owner of the facility. I believe \nthat this approach will allow us to use federal funds responsibly while \nreducing risk to our citizens.\n  Once the transition is complete, the facility will be required to \ntrack all cost-savings related to the switch, such as decreased \nsecurity costs, costs savings by eliminating administrative \nrequirements under the EPA risk management plan, lower insurance \npremiums, and others. If savings are ultimately realized by the \nfacility, it will be required to return one half of these saving, not \nto exceed the grant amount, back to the EPA. In turn, the EPA will \nutilize any returned savings to help facilitate the transition of more \nwater facilities.\n  A 2005 report by the Government Accountability Office found that \nproviding grants to assist water facilities to transition to safer \ntechnologies was an appropriate use of federal funds. The costs for an \nindividual facility to transition will vary, but the cost is very cheap \nwhen you consider the security benefit. For example, the Wilmington \nfacility invested approximately $160,000 to transition and eliminated \nthe risk to nearly 600,000 people. Similarly, the Blue Plains facility \nspent $500,000 to transition after 9/11 and eliminated the risk to 1.2 \nmillion citizens immediately. This, in my view, is a sound use of \nfunds. And, this legislation will provide sufficient funding to \ntransition all of our high-priority facilities throughout the Nation.\n  Finally, I would like to point out that facilities making the \ndecision to transition after 9/11, but before the enactment date of \nthis legislation will be eligible to participate in the program \nauthorized by this legislation. I've included this provision because I \nbelieve that the federal government should acknowledge--and promote--\nlocal decisions that enhance our homeland security. In addition we \ndon't want to create a situation where water facilities wait for \nFederal funding before doing the right thing and eliminating those \ndangerous gaseous chemicals.\n  Last December the 9/11 Discourse Project released its report card for \nthe administration and Congress on efforts to implement the 9/11 \nCommission recommendations. It was replete with D's and F's \ndemonstrating that we have been going in the wrong direction with \nrespect to homeland security. One of the most troubling findings made \nby the 9/11 Commission is that with respect to our Nation's critical \ninfrastructure that ``no risk and vulnerability assessments actually \nmade; no national priorities established; no recommendations made on \nallocations of scarce resources. All key decisions are at least a year \naway. It is time that we stop talking about priorities and actually get \nsome.'' While much remains to be done, the Community Water Treatment \nHazards Reduction Act of 2006 sets an important priority for our \nhomeland security and it affirmatively addresses it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2920\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ct. 2764, 2793 (2005));\n       Whereas many computer systems of the colleges and \n     universities of the United States, including local area \n     networks under the control of such colleges and universities, \n     may be illicitly utilized by students and employees to \n     further unlawful copying;\n       Whereas throughout the course of the past few years, \n     Federal law enforcement has repeatedly executed search \n     warrants against computers and computer systems located at \n     colleges and universities, and has convicted students and \n     employees of colleges and universities for their role in \n     criminal intellectual property crimes;\n       Whereas in addition to illicit activity, illegal peer-to-\n     peer use has multiple negative impacts on college computer \n     systems;\n       Whereas individuals engaged in illegal downloading on \n     college computer systems use significant amounts of system \n     bandwidth which exist for the use of the general student \n     population in the pursuit of legitimate educational purposes;\n       Whereas peer-to-peer use on college computer systems \n     potentially exposes those systems to a myriad of security \n     concerns, including spyware, viruses, worms or other \n     malicious code which can be easily transmitted throughout the \n     system by peer-to-peer networks;\n       Whereas, according to a recent study released by the Motion \n     Picture Association of America, students at colleges and \n     universities in the United States accounted for $579,000,000 \n     in losses to the motion picture industry of the United States \n     in 2005, which represents 44 percent of that industry's \n     annual losses due to piracy;\n       Whereas computer systems at colleges and universities exist \n     for the use of all students and should be kept free of \n     illicit activity;\n       Whereas college and university systems should continue to \n     develop and to encourage respect for the importance of \n     protecting intellectual property, the potential legal \n     consequences of illegally downloading copyrighted works, and \n     the additional security risks associated with unauthorized \n     peer-to-peer use; and\n       Whereas it should be clearly established that illegal peer-\n     to-peer use is prohibited and violations punished consistent \n     with upholding the rule of law: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) colleges and universities should continue to take a \n     leadership role in educating students regarding the \n     detrimental consequences of online infringement of \n     intellectual property rights; and\n       (2) colleges and universities should continue to take steps \n     to deter and eliminate unauthorized peer-to-peer use on their \n     computer systems by adopting or continuing policies to \n     educate and warn students about the risks of unauthorized \n     use, and educate students about the intrinsic value of and \n     need to protect intellectual property.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4897-3", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4897-S4898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED & PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4085.

and\n       (iii) extend financing for alternative rural economic \n     activities beyond direct agricultural production;\n       (D) expanding efforts to reduce the transaction costs of \n     remittance flows in order to increase the pool of savings \n     available to help finance domestic investment in Mexico;\n       (E) encouraging Mexican corporations to adopt \n     internationally recognized corporate governance practices, \n     including anti-corruption and transparency principles;\n       (F) enhancing Mexican efforts to strengthen governance at \n     all levels, including efforts to improve transparency and \n     accountability, and to eliminate corruption, which is the \n     single biggest obstacle to development;\n       (G) assisting the Government of Mexico in implementing all \n     provisions of the Inter-American Convention Against \n     Corruption (ratified by Mexico on May 27, 1997) and urging \n     the Government of Mexico to participate fully in the \n     Convention's formal implementation monitoring mechanism;\n       (H) helping the Government of Mexico to strengthen \n     education and training opportunities throughout the country, \n     with a particular emphasis on improving rural education; and\n       (I) encouraging the Government of Mexico to create \n     incentives for persons who have migrated to the United States \n     to return to Mexico.\n       (3) Sense of congress regarding bilateral partnership on \n     health care.--It is the sense of Congress that the Government \n     of the United States and the Government of Mexico should \n     enter into a partnership to examine uncompensated and \n     burdensome health care costs incurred by the United States \n     due to legal and illegal immigration, including--\n       (A) increasing health care access for poor and under served \n     populations in Mexico;\n       (B) assisting Mexico in increasing its emergency and trauma \n     health care facilities along the border, with emphasis on \n     expanding prenatal care in the region along the international \n     border between the United States and Mexico;\n       (C) facilitating the return of stable, incapacitated \n     workers temporarily employed in the United States to Mexico \n     in order to receive extended, long-term care in their home \n     country; and\n       (D) helping the Government of Mexico to establish a program \n     with the private sector to cover the health care needs of \n     Mexican nationals temporarily employed in the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4095.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 486, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 486) designating June 2006 as \n     ``National Internet Safety Month.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduced a resolution \ndesignating June 2006 as National Internet Safety Month. I am pleased \nto have Mr. Allen, Mr. Craig, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Vitter, Ms. Landrieu, \nMrs. Dole, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Burns, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Warner, Mr. Johnson, \nMr. Roberts, Mr. Santorum, and Mr. DeWine join me in introducing this \nresolution.\n  The Internet has become one of the most significant advances in the \ntwentieth century and, as a result it affects people's lives in a \npositive manner each day. However, this technology presents dangers \nthat need to be brought to the attention of all Americans. Never before \nhas the problem of online predatory behavior been more of a concern. \nConsider the pervasiveness of Internet access by children and the rapid \nincrease in Internet crime and predatory behavior. Never before have \npowerful educational solution's--such as Internet safety curricula for \ngrades kindergarten through 12--been more critical and readily at hand.\n  i-SAFE America is one of the nonprofit organizations that has worked \ntirelessly to educate our youth and our community on these important \nissues. Formed in 1998, i-SAFE America educates youth in all 50 states \nWashington, DC, and Department of Defense schools worldwide to ensure \nthat they have a safe experience online.\n  It is imperative that all Americans learn about the Internet safety \nstrategies which will help keep their children safe from victimization. \nConsider the facts: In the United States, about 90 percent of children \nbetween the ages of 5 and 17 use computers, and about 59 percent use \nthe Internet. Approximately 26 percent of children in that age group \nare online more than 5 hours a week, and 12 percent spend more time \nonline than they do with their friends.\n  An alarming statistic is that 39 percent of youths in grades 5 \nthrough 12 in the United States admit giving out their personal \ninformation, such as their name, age, and gender over the Internet. \nFurthermore, 11.5 percent of students in this age group have actually \nmet face to face with a stranger they met on the Internet.\n  Most disturbing are the patterns of Internet crimes against children. \nIn 1996, the Federal Bureau of Investgation was involved in 113 cases \ninvolving Internet crimes against children.

BECKER\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \nfuneral service that was held earlier today for Judge Edward R. Becker. \nJudge Becker was one of the greatest citizens in the history of the \ncity of Philadelphia and one of the greatest Federal judges in the \nhistory of the United States. When the contemporary history is written \nof the past 50 years, I believe Judge Becker will rank with Benjamin \nFranklin among the greatest of Philadelphia citizens, and with Judge \nLearned Hand, who is among the greatest Federal judges.\n  I first met Judge Becker in 1950 when we rode public transportation \nfrom northeast Philadelphia to the University of Pennsylvania, an hour \nride each way, where we attended that school. He was 17 at the time; I \nwas 20. He was a freshman, and I was a senior. He had an extraordinary \nacademic record, Phi Beta Kappa from Penn, Yale Law School, a \ndistinguished record in the practice of law, and he became a Federal \njudge at the age of 37. He served on the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania for 15 years, until he was elevated to \nthe Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  During 35\\1/2\\ years, he had an extraordinary record as a Federal \njudge. On several occasions, Judge Becker's opinions were followed by \nthe Supreme Court of the United States on cutting edge questions. In \none case, Judge Becker wrote the opinion for the Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit, which was in disagreement with the conclusions of \nseven other courts of appeals. When the issue got to the Supreme Court \nof the United States, the Supreme Court followed Judge Becker.\n  He was a man of great charm and great versatility. One of his \nopinions was written in rhyme. He was an extraordinary pianist and was \ncalled upon by the Supreme Court not only for his legal erudition but \nfor playing the piano at the so-called Supreme Court sing-a-longs. He \nwas the recipient of the Devitt Award, which is given to the \noutstanding Federal jurist on the basis of scholarship, achievement, \nand community service.\n  Even as chief judge of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, he \nrode the elevated public transportation to work every day. Among his \nmany attributes were intelligence--really brilliance--integrity, \nindependence, loyalty, and a sense of humor. But his greatest attribute \nwas his modesty and his humility.\n  He lived in the same house he came to as a child of 3 or 4 years of \nage and was always a friend equally to the janitors in the Federal \ncourthouse as he was to Supreme Court Justices.\n  Regrettably, Judge Becker contracted prostate cancer and fought a \nvaliant fight but succumbed last Friday to the ravages of the cancer \nand, today, as I say, we celebrated a great life and an outstanding \nlife. One of the real regrets I have is that we have not yet found a \ncure for cancer, which could have saved Judge Becker's life.\n  In 1970, the President of the United States declared war on cancer \nand had that war been pursued with the same diligence and resources \nthat we pursue other wars, Judge Becker would not have died from \nprostate cancer. Two years ago, my chief of staff, Carey Lackman, a \nbeautiful young woman of 48, died of breast cancer. A year and a half \nago, a good friend, Paula Kline, wife of Tom Kline, my former law \npartner, died of breast cancer. It is something that we hear about \nevery day.\n  The reality is that the United States of America, with a gross \nnational product of $11 trillion and a Federal budget of $2.8 trillion, \ncould conquer cancer and the other maladies if we approached it with \nsufficient resources and a sufficient sense of urgency. We have a \nbudget for the subcommittee of appropriations that I chair which has to \nfund the Departments of Health, Education and Labor, workman safety, \nwhich has had cuts of $15.7 billion in the last two fiscal years, \nfactoring in inflation. We have a budget resolution that passed, which \nwould add $7 billion--insufficient but at least a start in making up \nsome of that deficiency which would allocate $2 billion to the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  The Federal Government is precluded from financing embryonic stem \ncell research, which ought to be reversed by this body.\n  Judge Becker is well known to the Senate. Shortly after he achieved \nsenior status, when he turned 70 in May of 2003, I asked him to \nparticipate in our legislative efforts to have asbestos reform. In \nAugust of 2003, for 2 days, he convened the so-called stakeholders--the \nmanufacturers, the trial lawyers, the AFL-CIO representing labor, and \nthe insurance industry in his chambers. And for the intervening almost \n3 years he has presided at about 50 meetings where large groups \nassembled in my conference room on Capitol Hill, working for a \nresolution of the asbestos litigation crisis, where thousands of people \nsuffering from mesothelioma are unable to get compensation because \ntheir companies are bankrupt. Seventy-seven companies have gone under \nbankruptcy.\n  Judge Becker, well known to this body, is really befitting of the \ntitle of\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\nthe 101st Senator. I think his passing from prostate cancer will make a \ndeep indentation and mark on this body and will serve as a signal for \naction to attack cancer, attack prostate cancer, to find a cure for \ncancer. His passing leaves a very deep mark on his family, three \nchildren, his widow, four grandchildren, and many friends, many of whom \nare in this body. His record is truly that of an extraordinary jurist \nand a great American.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to have been here this \nevening to hear the remarks of Senator Specter about his friend Judge \nBecker. I came to know him and respect him greatly myself. I remember \nit was Judge Becker this and Judge Becker that as we wrestled with the \nasbestos litigation. Senator Specter, I knew, had such extraordinary \nrespect for him. I guess it probably would be fair to say that in the \nlast year, if there had to be a 101st Senator, he might have been the \none we would name because he met time and time again with Senators and \ngroups and interests and people to try to work out an asbestos bill \nthat would be effective.\n  I came around to the thinking that he was exactly correct and agreed \nthat he and Senator Specter had the right approach to that historic \npiece of legislation.\n  I am very sad we never could move it forward, but Judge Becker \nprovided a great and extraordinary contribution to the legislation. In \ngetting to know him, talking to him about other judges, he talked about \nBill Pryor, a judge from Alabama who was recently confirmed. He knew \nand studied his record. I came to feel that he was a fine and decent \nperson who loved his country and just didn't want to retire and sit \naround. He was right in the middle of things to his last days on this \nEarth.\n  I thank Senator Specter for allowing us the opportunity to get to \nknow him. I hope he will convey to Judge Becker's family our admiration \nand respect for him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank him \nfor those very generous comments. I kept Judge Becker fully informed as \nto our work on the asbestos legislation. The leader has stated his \ninterest in bringing the legislation back to the floor. I continue to \nlobby our colleagues one by one. I gave Judge Becker a report a few \ndays before his passing, and he said: Let's pass one for the Gipper.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not surprised. I am not surprised at all that he \nwould be focused on policies that are important for America, even \nduring his suffering.\n  I thank Senator Specter for letting us get to know him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4918-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4918-S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, cloture has been filed on the \nimmigration legislation, and I suspect cloture will be obtained on the \nimmigration bill. We will have a vote later on in the week. The train \nis moving. People simply want to do something, and I suppose that is \nwhere we are headed.\n  I wish to make a couple comments about it. First, the difficulty we \nfaced was that the bill which came out of the Judiciary Committee to \nthe floor of the Senate, which was essentially the Kennedy-McCain bill, \nwas not good legislation. In fact, it was so broadly problematic that I \nthought and said from the beginning there was no way we could file \namendments to fix that bill. It was unfixable. It had too many basic \nproblems that had not been evaluated carefully, that should have been \nthought through carefully before it was ever filed.\n  Senator Specter just left the Chamber. He supports immigration. We \nstarted in the Judiciary Committee a few months ago--really just a \ncouple of months ago--and his bill was a lot better than the bill that \ncame out of the Judiciary Committee. The chairman's mark had a number \nof provisions in it. It did not have an automatic path to citizenship, \nfor example. So we spent several days talking around at the committee. \nSenator Frist said he wanted this bill on the floor a certain date. \nThat was a Tuesday. He wanted the bill out of committee. On Monday, we \nwere still talking about various technical, complex legal issues and \ndebating them and worrying about law enforcement issues, and, boom, the \nKennedy-McCain bill is offered as a substitute to the Specter bill in \ncommittee. With about an hour's debate, this several-hundred page bill \nbecame the bill in committee.\n  A few minutes later with very little debate, the agriculture jobs \npart was added to the bill, and that is what came out of committee. It \nwas incredibly broad, huge in its increase in legal immigration into \nthe country, as well as I think inadequate enforcement and overreaching \nin amnesty and a lot of other issues.\n  So here we are trying to pass this legislation. I guess we have done \nit now. I spent some time pointing out some of the difficulties, and I \nwill continue to do so. I will say this: The legislation that will hit \nthe floor presumably this week and will be up for a vote should not be \npassed by us.\n  I have four amendments on which I would like to have votes. I know \nwhat is going to happen. Cloture has been filed, and I will be lucky to \nget one vote on the four amendments I will be filing tonight, to get \nlegislative council to approve them and worry about germaneness and a \nlot of other things, but I am ready to file these amendments and will \nfile them.\n  I want to talk about those amendments, and I ask the American people \nand my colleagues to think about some of the issues in these four \namendments and ask: Should not, when we set about establishing a new \nimmigration policy for America, which has consistently been a 20-year \npolicy--we did one in the midsixties and we did another one in 1986. \nHere we are 20 years later in 2006 passing another one. We are going to \npass a bill that could set policy for quite some time. It ought to be a \ngood bill. It should be a bill of which we are proud.\n  It should be a piece of legislation that considers the relevant \nissues facing our country and tries to fairly and decently and justly \ntreat people who want to come here in a legitimate way, but \nfundamentally what we should be asking ourselves is how many people \nthis country can accept and what kind of skill levels should they have, \nwhat expectation do we have that they will be successful when they come \nto this country and be able to take advantage of the opportunities that \nare here, to be able to pay taxes to the Government more than they draw \nfrom the Government, and those kinds of questions. That is what we are \nabout. I submit that the legislation fails in that regard.\n  I have four amendments. One is a numerical limit amendment. It would \ncap the immigration increases caused by the bill to the numbers CBO and \nthe White House tell us to expect, 7 million under amnesties and 8 \nmillion in new immigrations in the next 10 years. We had somewhat of a \ndispute. This bill is 600 pages. It is exceedingly complicated. It has \na host of different categories. It has caps that apply and numbers that \ndon't apply to caps and are exempted from caps. It is hard to figure \nout how many people might actually come.\n  The Heritage Foundation and my staff have concluded that we are \nlooking at four times the current rate of immigration. It was 5 to 10 \ntimes the current rate of immigration until we discussed these huge \nnumbers at a press conference last Monday, and Tuesday we adopted an \namendment to knock that down. We think the immigration in that country \nwill range from 73 million to 93 million people over the next 20 years. \nThat represents approximately four times the amount we now allow in, \nwhich is a little less than 1 million a year, so it will be a little \nless than 19 million over 20 years, five times current rate, four times \ncurrent rate at a minimum, we think.\n  The administration and CBO say some of those numbers were not good \nenough, and they came up with some figures.\n  That amendment would be designed to say: OK, we will look at your \nnumbers and see if we can just make that the law so it won't be \nconfusing. At least we will know what the numbers are. If the \nadministration numbers are correct and the CBO numbers are correct, \nthey are too high, way too high, but at least we would know what they \nare. At least we wouldn't have to worry that they might go and explode \nout of reason.\n\n  Another amendment we will be offering is the amendment to eliminate \nthe\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\nearned income tax credit for illegal aliens and those who adjust status \nunder this bill. Once illegal aliens become citizens, they will once \nagain be eligible for the earned income tax credit, which is nothing \nmore than a Government payment. It is a Government subsidy to low wage \nAmerican workers, and it is very large. I will talk about that in a \nminute.\n  Chain migration. We will offer an amendment that would eliminate \ncertain chain migration provisions in this bill. If we want to admit \nmore skill-based immigrants, we must reduce the right of immigrants to \nbring in certain categories of relatives automatically and they have an \nautomatic right on the list to be able to come in. We need to make that \nchoice. Why is this Senate dodging that issue? I don't know. Other \ncountries, as I have noted just a few moments ago, are going in exactly \nthe opposite direction. They are focusing less on some sort of \nconnections and more on work skills.\n  Then I will offer an amendment that deals with green cards for future \nflow H-2C workers. This would be an amendment to make sure that H-2C \nworkers who come in the future--not those given amnesty under this \nbill--will be subject to the annual numerical limits on employment-\nbased green cards when they apply. There is some dispute about that. We \nwere told originally: Oh, yes, they apply, the caps apply, these limits \napply. And then we read the legislation carefully, and under that \nprovision, it says: If you qualify for a green card, the Secretary \nshall give you the green card. And it appears that ``shall'' means you \nwill get it whether the caps apply or not, or whether the caps would \napply.\n  I shared earlier thoughts about the large numbers and the CBO numbers \nin that amendment. I have discussed it. I would like to take a few \nmoments to discuss the earned income tax credit limit.\n  This amendment would do two things. One, it would clarify existing \nlaw that makes illegal aliens ineligible to claim the earned income tax \ncredit and postpones the ability of illegal aliens who are given status \nby this bill to claim the earned income tax credit until they become \ncitizens. So the amendment is clearly a moneysaver. It is also a way to \nmake sure that illegal aliens are more likely to contribute more in \ntaxes than they are taking out. The inability to claim the earned \nincome tax credit should be one of the things added to the list of \nitems illegal aliens will have to agree to do in order to receive the \nbenefits of the amnesties contained in title VI of the bill. Other \nitems on the list include a background check, a medical check, and \npayment of back taxes, and being required to not claim the EITC until \nthe illegal alien becomes a citizen is a natural addition to that list.\n  The EITC tax credit was established in 1975. It is a refundable tax \ncredit for families that can offset income taxes or provide a tax \ncredit directly to the family. According to IRS data for 2003, 22 \nmillion households received $39 billion in EITC payments, an average of \n$1,782 per household or $2,100 for any families with children.\n  Now, let me just repeat that. This is a huge Government program. And \nmost of the low-income people don't owe any taxes. If you are making \nbelow $20,000 a year, you are unlikely to pay any income taxes. If you \nhave children, you certainly are not going to be paying any income \ntaxes. So how do you get a tax credit if you don't pay any taxes? Well, \nthey send you a check. That is what they do. You file your tax return \nat the end of the year, and if you have worked and your income was \nlower, they send you a check. We looked at the numbers. If you are a \nminimum wage worker and you make around $14,000 a year, that family \nwould receive a check, a subsidy from the Government of 4,700-and-some-\nodd dollars.\n  So this was designed to encourage Americans to work. It was a plan to \nmake work more attractive for people on welfare. Do you remember all \nthat talk: Well, you can make more money on welfare than you make \nworking. So a brilliant Congress, a number of years ago, came up with \nthis idea that we would just give people extra money if they would \nwork. It will be less than welfare, so why not do it? OK. That is what \nwe did. But it was not designed to reward illegal aliens for coming \ninto the country illegally, for heaven's sake. But that is what this \nbill does. As soon as they get that regularized status, they get it.\n  Now, this would allow them to get the earned income tax credit if \nthey become a citizen but not before. That is not required of us. It is \nnot required of the Senate that we should provide a $2,000 bonus check \nto individuals who work in our country, who seem to be happy to get the \nwages they are being paid, a $2,000 bonus check from Uncle Sam as a \nresult and as an incentive for coming into the country illegally. That \nis a really big issue.\n  To qualify for the credit, married couples filing jointly who earn \ncertain sums of money would qualify. For example, a single mother with \ntwo children, the earned income tax credit provides a tax credit for 40 \npercent of every dollar earned, up to $11,340. A family that earned \nbetween $11,000 and $14,000 received a maximum credit of $4,536, not \n$4,700. After the floor of $14,810 is reached, the credit is slowly \nreduced until the income cap of $36,000 is reached. It is only then \nthat it is eliminated. For 2006, the maximum amount of the earned \nincome tax credit is $4,556 for a worker supporting two kids and $2,747 \nfor a worker with one child, $4,012 for a child of eligible employees \nand adjusted for inflation.\n  Now, a Social Security number is required in order to reap the \nbenefits of this tax credit, and those applying must have a valid \nSocial Security number and be a resident alien. Valid Social Security \nnumbers are given out to all legally working people in the United \nStates--legally working aliens. Legal permanent residents and citizens \nhave Social Security numbers.\n\n  Under the tax law, resident aliens are citizens of a foreign country \nwho are either lawful permanent residents of the United States or have \nbeen physically present in the country for at least a certain specified \namount of time during the past 3 years. They are taxed in the same \nmanner as U.S. citizens, and thus they qualify for the refundable tax \ncredits.\n  According to the IRS, under the residency rules of the Tax Code, any \nalien who is a nonresident alien--an alien will become a resident alien \nin one of three ways: No. 1, by being admitted to the United States as \nor changing in status to a lawful permanent resident under the \nimmigration laws; No. 2, by passing a substantial presence test, a \nnumerical formula which measures days of presence in the United \nStates; or No. 3, by making what is called the first year election, a \nnumerical formula under which an alien may pass the substantial \npresence test 1 year earlier than under the normal rules.\n\n  Under these rules, legally present work-authorized aliens who pass \nthe substantial presence test will be treated, for tax purposes, as \nresident aliens. They are able, then, to claim EITC. Under these rules, \neven an undocumented illegal alien who passes the substantial presence \ntest will be treated for tax purposes as a resident alien. If they are \nusing a fraudulent Social Security number, they can apply for the EITC. \nIf they are using a legal IDIF number, they cannot apply.\n  Under S. 2611, the bill before us today, if illegal aliens pay their \ntaxes legally today, they do so with an individual taxpayer \nidentification number they are given for tax purposes. The ITIN cannot \ncurrently be used to get the EITC because a Social Security number is \nrequired to claim the EITC. They are not eligible to get a Social \nSecurity number.\n  So under S. 2611, illegal aliens will become legally present and work \nauthorized immediately upon passage of the act. They would then be \ngiven Social Security numbers and will pass the substantial presence \ntest, making them automatically, at once, eligible to claim the very \ngenerous benefits of the EITC.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has looked at this and tried to \nfigure out what the cost would be. American taxpayers would pay this. \nThis would be a new cost on the taxpayers, created by the very bill \nthat is before us today. Under the current legislation, in S. 2611 as \ninitially offered and came out of the Judiciary Committee, the \npreliminary CBO score revealed the following about directed spending \ncontained in the compromise. They say this:\n\n       CBO and Joint Tax Committee estimate that direct spending \n     outlays would total about $8 billion for the first 5 years, \n     2007\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n     through 2011, and $27 billion for the first 10 years. Most of \n     those costs are for the earned-income tax credit and for \n     Medicaid and food stamp programs. Costs in subsequent decades \n     would be greater than in this first 10-year period.\n\n  ``Costs in further decades would be greater than the first decade.'' \nMr. Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has worked on numbers like \nthis. He was the architect of the welfare reform. He said to us \nrecently, a group of Senators: Senators, this is how this Government \ngets out of control. This is how things go wrong. You don't start out \nto pass a bill that is going to cost $29 billion. You don't think it \nthrough. You pass the legislation, and a new Congress 20 years from now \nwakes up and says: How did this ever happen? We don't have the money to \npay for this. We made this obligation way long ago. How are we going to \nget out of it? Maybe we should cut back.\n  Then all the protests start because you can never cut a program, it \nseems.\n  He warned us about that. That is exactly what is happening with this \nparticular provision in the legislation.\n  Once the Hagel-Martinez bill became S. 2611, I, along with five other \nSenators, asked CBO to provide a comprehensive score so we would know \nhow much this amnesty provision would cost the taxpayers. The final CBO \nscore estimates that, of the 2007-2016 period, 10 years, this bill \nwould increase outlays for refunding tax credits $29.4 billion, the \nlargest direct expenditure in the bill--$29 billion.\n  I had a conversation a few moments ago with a fine Senator who is \nconcerned about spending. He was sincerely asking me about the cost of \nenforcement at the border and at the workplace in our country. Where \nare we going to get this money so we are not just putting it to our \ngrandchildren? I don't know how much it is going to cost. We spend $40 \nbillion now on homeland security every year. Maybe this is going to \ncost $5 or $6 billion. A lot of it will be one-time costs, setting up \ncomputer systems and border barriers and in purchases of equipment. A \nlot of that will be repetitive, like border patrol and bed spaces or \nremoving people from the country. But it will not exceed $29 billion, \ntrust me. It will be a fraction of that.\n  Mr. President, $29 billion is a lot of money under any circumstances, \nI have to tell you. You can buy three aircraft carriers for $29 \nbillion. They have 4,000 people on them. Mr. President, $29.4 billion \nwill be added. These refundable tax credits will include EITC and child \ntax credits, where most of the cost is clearly attributable to the \nEITC. To clarify, the credit first reduces an individual's tax \nliability. If the credit exceeds the tax liability, the excess is sent \nto the individual in the form of a check from Uncle Sam. These refunds \nare classified as outlays in the Federal budget. They are classified as \noutlays. They are not classified as tax deductions because they are, in \nfact, outlays. They are, in fact, payments from Uncle Sam sent in the \nform of a check to individual Americans.\n  In conclusion, I would note the bill increases the amount of \nrefundable tax credits by increasing the number of resident aliens, \npeople who are illegal today, converted to resident aliens. Although \nthis bill grants amnesty to those who came illegally, it is not \nrequired, in my view, that they be absolved from all consequences of \ncoming here illegally nor be provided every benefit we provide to those \nwho come legally. Certainly nothing is strange or unusual in that.\n  If we decide to give certain benefits to people who came here \nillegally and not give them to others, what is wrong with that? For \nexample, we are going to allow them to stay in the country. At least \noverwhelmingly, they will be able to stay in the country. We are going \nto forgive them for being prosecuted. Do we have to then also reward \nthem for their illegal activity by providing a sizeable check every \nyear from the Federal Government? No, you don't have to do that. If \nthey become a citizen one day, fine, they are entitled to the same \nbenefits of every other American citizen. But not in the interim.\n  My amendment clarifies existing law to make sure that illegal \naliens--existing law--who pass the substantial presence test cannot use \nfraudulent Social Security numbers to claim the earned-income tax \ncredit, and it postpones the ability of illegal aliens at a given \nstatus, some sort of legal status by the bill, to claim the earned-\nincome tax credit until they become citizens. I believe that is the \nright approach. It is unthinkable that we would provide this kind of \nincentive when it really has no necessity.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts about another \namendment. It deals with chain migration. It would reduce chain \nmigration by eliminating the provisions in the Immigration and \nNationality Act that allow parents and adult brothers and sisters to \nimmigrate to the United States based solely on their family \nconnections. Chain migration refers to the mechanism by which foreign \nnationals have the right to immigrate to the United States by virtue of \none single characteristic: they are related to someone who previously \nimmigrated to the United States. Chain migration does not refer to \nspouses and dependent children of immigrants. That does not encompass \nwives and children. Nothing in this amendment would say that a green \ncard holder, a legal permanent resident or citizen would not be able to \nbring spouses and children. That will remain the law under this \namendment. No changes are made whatsoever. But for immigrants who \nbecome citizens, chain migration refers to their ability to bring in \nparents, brothers and sisters, and spouses, and children of their \nbrothers and sisters.\n  You get to bring in your parents, your brothers and sisters, and the \nspouses and children of your brothers and sisters. People who immigrate \nbased on this family relationship are in no way evaluated for their \nskill levels, their age, their English proficiency, or if they are \nneeded by the American economy whatever skills they have. How they will \nbenefit the United States is completely irrelevant to this process. The \nonly relevant characteristic is their family connection.\n  Until the late 1950s, American family immigration policy focused \nsolely on the nuclear family; only spouses and minor dependent children \nof the immigrant were allowed to immigrate solely on their family \nconnection.\n  In the late 1950s, family migration policies of the United States \nbegan to extend beyond children and spouses. Immigrants were allowed to \nbring in their adult unmarried children. You are here, you can bring in \nadult children from that foreign country. But they are unmarried, and \nyou can bring them. Immigrants who became citizens were allowed to \nbring in their married adult children and their parents and their \nbrothers and sisters, parents and brothers and sisters, and adult \nchildren can bring in their own spouse and their children. If the \nextended spouse has parents and siblings, they, too, can get in line to \nimmigrate to the United States based solely on the family connection.\n  To show you a little bit how this works--it sounds a bit complicated. \nBy viewing the charts behind me, maybe we can make this a little bit \nclearer.\n  Here are the people in green. That means they possess a green card. \nYou can get green cards in any number of ways if you come in under the \nlanguage of this legislation that is so inaccurate. Let me say it that \nway.\n  Under the rubric they call a temporary guest worker, the first day \nyou are here, your employer can apply for a green card, and within a \nmonth presumably you will get that green card. Once you become a green \ncard holder, you become green on that chart, but you also became a \npermanent resident of the United States, not a citizen.\n  What happens when you become a permanent resident? You can \nimmediately bring in your spouse and your children, maybe half a dozen \nchildren. You can bring in all of those children.\n  One thing about this amnesty is this: There are a lot of people who \nare working in our country today who have not brought their families. \nThey have not been that interested in bringing their wives and children \nhere, but under the bill, we give them legal status. We allow them to \nbecome a green card holder in short order, and then they are \nautomatically allowed to bring in their spouses and children.\n  Five years after they get the green card, they can apply to be a \ncitizen. So 5 years, they become a citizen. Here is the family now, \nthis group here, green. They come over. This is the nuclear family: \nFather, mother, and two children. The mother is now legal. She can\n\n[[Page S4921]]\n\nbring in her parents; he can bring in his parents.\n  What about brothers and sisters? Each one gets to bring in their \nbrothers, and then they can bring in their wife and their children.\n  This lady has one brother. She allows that brother to come in as a \nrelative within the category, and then he can bring his wife and his \nchildren.\n  What about her? She probably has brothers and sisters, too. Once she \ngets in and gets in the system, she can bring her brothers and sisters \nand her parents into the system. The father here can bring in his \nbrother or sister, and she can bring in her husband and her two \nchildren, or however many they have.\n  I believe somebody detailed once on the floor of the Senate that one \nfamily brought in 85 under this system. It is not at all impossible to \nimagine. Can you see how it can happen? One person comes in, and as a \nresult of the family connections he brought in 85. I think that was \nSenator Allen Simpson in the debate 20 years ago in 1986.\n  It is a remarkable story, how the nuclear family, 5 years after they \nbecome citizens, can bring in their parents.\n  What can the parents do? The parents can bring in their parents, if \nthey are still alive. They really can. Maybe they are 90. They can \nbring in their brothers and sisters. All the uncles can come in through \nthe parents. The wife can bring in brothers and sisters. Then the wife \nbrings in her brother, who brings in his wife and two children, and she \nbrings in her parents. It just goes on and on.\n  We would like to do the right thing. We would like to be generous. \nSomeone made the argument, I guess at one point in time it seemed like \na good idea to have that policy. But every now and then, when we review \na bill once in 20 years, you would think we would have discussed this. \nIt has not been discussed, to my knowledge. Not a single Senator has \ndiscussed it on the floor of the Senate, to my knowledge. No amendment \nhas been offered on it. It was not discussed, I don't think, but maybe \njust in passing in some of the Judiciary Committee debate of which I \nwas a member. It is a serious matter.\n  Obviously, we ought to do a better job of thinking through who should \ncome to America. I keep thinking about a valedictorian in the Dominican \nRepublic, some small town in Colombia, Peru, or Brazil, top of his \nclass, learned English, speaks it well, and wanting to come to the \nUnited States of America. We have a limited number of people who come. \nHe can never get in because grandparents, great-grandparents, brothers \nand sisters and grand-nephews are coming in under migration, crowding \nthose numbers out. With regard to all of these people, there is no \nrequirement of any educational level, no requirement of any job skills \nor any other capability.\n  I think we need to make progress. There is no reason in the world we \nshouldn't be discussing that in an effective way. Over the past 5 \nyears, approximately 950,000--almost 1 million--extended family members \nimmigrated to the United States and immediately received a green card--\nlawful permanent resident who will never have to leave.\n  The numbers equal about 20 percent of all aliens who immigrated to \nthe United States in the last 5 years. Immigration, therefore, makes up \na significant portion of family-based immigration.\n  If we want to discuss the percentage of family-based immigration and \nincrease the percentage of skill-based, it makes sense that we would \ndeal with this issue. I think this amendment needs to be considered. I \nam disappointed that we really have not had time, with cloture being \nfiled we will not have time to seriously discuss that.\n  Let's talk about one more issue. I don't mind saying I cannot be sure \nthat we have dealt in years with a bill more important than this one. \nMr. Rector of the Heritage Foundation said this bill is so significant \nit compares with the passage of Social Security and Medicare, in his \nopinion. He has been a student of these things for several decades. \nThis is a huge piece of legislation.\n\n  What has happened, a group has gotten together. They have reached a \ncompromise. We were told flatout the other night that one of the \namendments could not be accepted because the people who put the \ncompromise together would not accept it. They would not accept the \namendment because they said it violated the compromise, the compromise \nwould fall apart, and we could not amend it in that fashion. And it \nfailed. The machinery around here is working.\n  We will have an opportunity to talk about this additional issue \ntomorrow. I will plan to do that then. I am proud at least to have had \nthe opportunity to talk about this. The fact is, we are not going to be \nable to vote on this. We will be lucky to get a vote on one of them, \nand then this will be voted on. I assume it will be passed and sent to \nthe House of Representatives. If we are fortunate, the House of \nRepresentatives will say it has to be better; we will not accept it; we \nare going to insist on that before we pass it.\n  Who knows what will happen in the political processes of our country?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/05/22/senate-section/article/S4921-1", "month": "05", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
