Mr. President, the past 2 days I have taken the \nopportunity to come to the Senate to discuss my recess trip last week \nto the Middle East. As I mentioned yesterday, it was a fascinating \nexperience that allowed me a firsthand glimpse of the complicated \nchallenges facing the region. At each of my stops I had the opportunity \nto meet with top officials, community leaders, and I made a point of \nvisiting with opposition candidates. With each conversation I became \nmore convinced that despite the deep differences that divide them, each \nparty wants peace, wants prosperity, and each side knows that dialog is \nthe way forward.\n  Tuesday I spoke of my meetings in Israel. Yesterday I reported on my \nvisit to the West Bank. Today I will briefly comment on my time in \nCairo, Egypt.\n  We arrived on May 5 to a jampacked city of over 20 million people. We \nfirst met with President Hosni Mubarak, a lively and engaged and \nobviously well-informed man. We had an open and frank discussion about \nmany of the issues facing the country, as well as the region at large.\n  In particular, President Mubarak expressed his strong belief in \nAmerican leadership in the issues surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian \npeace efforts. We both agreed America is uniquely positioned to help \nboth the Israelis and the Palestinians bridge their differences. We \nalso agreed Egypt is critical to advancing this peace. As the regional \nArab power broker and the first Arab country to make peace with Israel, \nthis will be particularly true in the period following Israel's \ndisengagement from Gaza.\n  There is great concern among Israelis that once they withdraw, Gaza \nwill be used as a platform to launch attacks into Israel. President \nMubarak stressed to me his commitment to keep this from happening. He \nstressed it is in Egypt's own interest to prevent Gaza from descending \ninto chaos and lawlessness. That is why his country is prepared to \nfield a border security force of 750 guards to stop weapons\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\nsmuggling into Gaza and to prevent other criminal acts.\n  We also discussed the upcoming Egyptian Presidential elections. \nPresident Mubarak has asked his legislature for a change in the \nConstitution to allow multiple candidates to run for the Presidency. \nThis is an important step toward full democracy. I applaud his efforts. \nI am disappointed, however, by reports that the Constitutional \namendment just approved by Egypt's upper house requires Presidential \ncandidates to meet certain conditions to win a place on the ballot. It \nis widely believed these regulations will prevent any serious \ncontenders from running for President. In short, unless this amendment \nis modified, its final approval will practically guarantee the ruling \nparty will select its own token competitors and continue its domination \nof the Presidency.\n  Meaningful reform means free and fair elections. Opposition \ncandidates must be able to declare their candidacy freely. They must be \nallowed to broadcast their message through the media. And they must be \npermitted to acquire the resources necessary to run a genuine campaign.\n\n  Jailing opposition candidates, such as Ayman Nour, whom I had the \nopportunity to meet with in his apartment, and who recently declared \nfrom prison his intention to seek the Presidency, undermines the true \nmeaning of democracy, and it undermines the people's faith that the \nGovernment is working on their behalf.\n  Egypt has been a close ally and good friend of the United States, but \nit still has a long way to go on the path toward political reform. \nAfter my meeting with President Mubarak, I held talks with Prime \nMinister Ahmed Nazif. He is pushing strong economic reforms throughout \nthe country. He is lowering taxes and lowering other economic barriers, \nstripping away unnecessary regulations, and it is working.\n  According to the Prime Minister, the public sector used to contribute \n70 percent to the GDP and the private sector 30 percent. Now those \nnumbers are reversed, with the private sector contributing 70 percent \nand the public sector 30 percent. The economy is growing.\n  Lowering taxes and breaking down these barriers to opportunity are \nthe keys to prosperity. It is gratifying to see this basic principle \nbeing embraced around the world. After failed experiments in socialism, \nas well as nationalism, Egypt appears to finally be embracing the power \nof free markets.\n  I am hopeful that as economic opportunity flourishes, the allure of \nextremism will fade, and the people and the leadership will be inspired \nto secure ever greater political freedoms.\n  While in Cairo, my group and I also visited the El Gallaa Maternity \nTeaching Hospital--the largest of its kind in the region. It is a large \npublic teaching hospital. Over 20,000 babies are born there each year.\n  As I toured the hospital, I had the opportunity to meet with Egyptian \ndoctors and nurses and other health professionals. I was also taken to \nthe pediatric intensive care unit where dedicated health professionals \nworked to keep premature babies and at-risk newborns healthy. Their \ndetermination was inspiring, especially surrounded as they were by \nless-than-ideal conditions in downtown Cairo.\n  All in all, I came away from my stop in Egypt convinced that this \nhistoric country has the potential to set a positive example for the \nrest of the Middle East, and it is doing so. Egypt has been a trusted \npartner in the Middle East peace process and an important ally in the \nwar on terrorism.\n  The United States must continue to promote democracy and freedom \naround the world.\n  As Egypt embraces these reforms, I am confident our two countries can \nform a stronger and more dependable relationship. I am confident that \ntogether we can achieve peace, security, and prosperity for the people \nof the Middle East.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5008-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5008-S5010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, in January of this year, I stood in this \nvery Chamber, placed one hand on the Bible, and raised the other hand. \nIn taking my oath of office, I made a simple pledge to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States of America. However, only 4 months \nlater--because of the partisanship of some--I am prevented from \nfulfilling my oath.\n  It is interesting to observe what the Constitution requires of the \nSenate and what it does not. Nowhere does it say that Congress must \npass new laws. But it does specify Senators must ``advise and consent'' \non the President's judicial nominees.\n  How can I perform my constitutionally mandated duties to advise and \nconsent without the ability to vote on the nominees sent to us by the \nPresident? How can I represent the people of South Carolina, who \nelected me to serve their interests, without the ability to vote yes or \nno?\n  Today, 41 Senators are preventing a bipartisan majority from carrying \nout the duty we were elected to fulfill. This is outrageous.\n  The President of the United States is given the authority, under the \nConstitution, to choose his own nominees. We have an obligation to vote \non those nominees. Forty-one Senators are trying to thwart the will of \nthe American people and the Constitution.\n  Beginning in 2003, Democrats used the filibuster to block up-or-down \nvotes on 10 nominations to the Federal appeals courts. All had \nbipartisan, majority support. Do not be fooled by the misinformation of \na few. Never in history has a judicial nominee with clear majority \nsupport been denied confirmation due to a filibuster.\n\n  Throughout my campaign, and each time I have been home this year, \nfolks in South Carolina have told me how furious they are that the \nPresident's nominees are being denied a vote. Democrats have chosen to \nthrow 200 years of tradition out the window by refusing to give \njudicial nominees a vote, and Americans are simply tired of the \npartisan obstruction.\n  Before I was elected, I said the Senate had become a ``graveyard of \ngood ideas'' due to partisan liberal obstruction. Unfortunately, it has \nnow become a ``graveyard of good nominees,'' such as Janice Rogers \nBrown.\n  California Supreme Court Justice Brown was nominated to the DC \nCircuit by President Bush in 2003. The first African American to serve \non the California high court, Justice Brown received public support \nfrom 76 percent of California voters and is widely respected as a \nleading intellect on the bench. She has been unanimously voted as \n``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association, which has been \ndescribed by those who oppose her nomination as the ``gold standard'' \nof judicial ratings.\n  The daughter of sharecroppers, Justice Brown was born in Greenville, \nAL, in 1949. During her childhood, she attended segregated schools and \ncame of age in the midst of Jim Crow policies in the South.\n  She has dedicated 24 years to public service, serving as legal \naffairs secretary to California Governor Pete Wilson; deputy secretary \nand general counsel for the California Business, Transportation, and \nHousing Agency; deputy attorney general in the Office of the California \nAttorney General; and as deputy legislative counsel in the California \nLegislative Counsel Bureau.\n  Just what is it that opponents of Justice Brown claim is their reason \nto deny her a fair vote? They obviously could not attack her experience \nor her character or her education or her intelligence, which are all \nimpeccable.\n  Instead, they have used the political equivalent of a desperate \n``Hail Mary Pass.'' They labeled Justice Brown as ``out of the \nmainstream.'' Really? Out of the mainstream?\n  Were three-quarters of Californians out of the mainstream when they \nelected her overwhelmingly to the State supreme court? She was elected \nby the largest margin of any of the judges up for retention that year.\n  Despite the claims of her opponents, her record demonstrates a \ncommitment to interpreting the law, not legislating from the bench.\n  If the obstructionist Senators who are vehemently opposed to her \nnomination feel so strongly that she is out of the mainstream, then \nthey should put their money where their mouth is and come down to this \nfloor and make their arguments against her nomination, then allow all \nof us to draw our own conclusions and cast our vote.\n  If Justice Brown is so truly unqualified, then surely her opponents \nwould\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\nbe confident of convincing a majority that this is the case. Otherwise, \nthey are simply smearing the integrity of a highly respected jurist in \norder to score political points against the President at the expense of \nvandalizing the Constitution.\n  One of my goals as a Senator is to confirm highly qualified judges by \nensuring timely up-or-down votes for all nominees no matter who is \nPresident, no matter which party is in the majority. That is my \ncommitment, and I have encouraged Senator Frist to consider all \noptions, including the constitutional option, to end the undemocratic \nblockade of judicial nominees. Senators were elected to advise and \nconsent, not to grandstand and obstruct.\n  I would like to say something to my colleagues across the aisle. \nThere is a reason George W. Bush was elected to serve as President of \nthe United States. It is because the majority of Americans trusted him \nto nominate judges.\n  There is a reason the American people elected a majority of \nRepublicans to the Senate. They trusted our judgment to vote on \njudicial nominees.\n  There is a reason the Democratic Party is in the minority in \nCongress. It is because the American people did not trust them to make \nthese decisions.\n  It is not a trivial matter. The issue of judicial nominations was at \nthe forefront of every Senate campaign in the last two cycles. Voters \nacross our Nation witnessed the obstruction of the Democrats over the \nlast 4 years, and they rendered their judgment at the polls.\n  In 2002, they returned the Republicans to the majority in the Senate. \nThen, after 2 years of unprecedented and, in my opinion, \nunconstitutional denials of simple votes on judicial nominees, \nAmericans elected an even larger majority of Republicans. In fact, the \nDemocrat leader, former Senator Tom Daschle, was defeated by my \ncolleague, Senator John Thune, in large part due to his high-profile \nobstruction of judicial nominees.\n  In my own campaign, I spoke frequently about the need to give every \nnominee a fair up-or-down vote. It was consistently the main issue \nvoters brought up with me one-on-one.\n\n  Now that the American people have clearly spoken, by democratically \nelecting a Republican President and a Republican majority in the \nSenate, 41 Senators are attempting to deny the will of the people. \nForty-one Senators believe they know better than the majority of \nAmericans. Forty-one Senators seem to think the elections and \nconstitutional duties we have do not matter. What matters to these 41 \nSenators is petty partisan politics.\n  This temper tantrum must end. The Democrats must accept the judgment \nof the American people. They cannot disregard election results simply \nbecause things did not go their way.\n  Now let me speak to my own party's leadership. It is time for the \nRepublican Party to lead, as Americans have elected us to do. We were \nnot sent to the Senate as a majority to quibble about process and \nprocedure. We were entrusted to carry out the duties laid out in the \nConstitution.\n  We ran on a platform of ideas to secure America's future, and the \nNation largely agreed with our vision. We also ran on the need to give \nthe President's nominees a fair up-or-down vote. The Senate Republican \nmajority must stand up for the Americans who elected us. We must have \nthe courage and conviction to uphold the Constitution and end the \npartisan obstruction. The time to act is now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to take the floor again on \nthe matter of judicial nominations. As the emotions and politics of \nthis issue keep building up, it is important we not lose sight of what \nthis is all about. We have all heard the grim, little joke about the \ndoctor who said: The operation was a complete success, but the patient \ndied.\n  Sometimes we get so caught up in process that we ignore the reasons \nwe are here in the first place: to achieve an outcome for the American \npeople to get things done, to make a difference.\n  The outcome the people want, the outcome the President deserves, and \nthe outcome the Constitution demands is an up-or-down vote--a simple \nup-or-down vote--on each of the appointments the President has \nsubmitted to us.\n  A couple years ago, I stood right over there, in front of that desk, \nand swore an oath to the Constitution of the United States of America. \nThe Constitution directs each Senator to ``advise and consent'' on \njudicial appointments by the President, not to advise and obstruct, not \nto advise and block, but simply advise and consent--which simply means, \nand has always meant in the history of this country, up until last \nyear, the opportunity for an up-or-down vote.\n  If you ask me, the term ``nuclear option'' belongs to the tactics \ntaken by the minority, unfortunately, in the last 2 years. I would say \nthey are treading on the traditions of this body, the balance of power \nbetween the branches, and the Constitution that we are sworn to uphold.\n  As the Bible says, what you sow, you will reap. When some in the \nminority decide to flaunt the historical procedures and understandings \nof this body, they should not be weeping and wailing and gnashing their \nteeth when the majority steps up to restore--to restore--200-plus years \nof accepted practice in this body, which is an up-or-down vote on \njudicial nominees once they have passed through committee. If the \nminority is feeling injured, they brought it on themselves.\n  Mr. President, I want to illustrate what a dramatic departure from \nhistorical precedent some in the minority have embarked upon in the \nlast year when 10 of the President's judicial nominees were \nfilibustered. For the first time, 10 circuit court nominees, at the \nlevel right below the Supreme Court, were filibustered.\n  Just look back a few years to the nomination of Clarence Thomas to \nthe Supreme Court in 1991. It was a media circus, riven with charges, \naccusations, and controversy. Clarence Thomas was confirmed with a vote \nof 52 to 48. If the Democrats had wanted to defeat him, they simply \ncould have filibustered his nomination. But they did not.\n  They could have filibustered his confirmation, but they did not. Did \nthey fail to do so because they simply wanted to be nice? No. It is \nfair to state that they didn't filibuster because at that time, in \n1991, it wasn't even conceivable, it wasn't in the history and \ntradition of this body that nominees who get through committee or to \nthe floor would fail to get an up-or-down vote, 52 to 48. Have no doubt \nabout it, if what is going on today was going on then, Clarence Thomas \nwould have been filibustered. It did not happen. At that time, my \ncolleagues did the right thing. They honored two centuries of tradition \nand allowed him an up-or-down vote.\n  I have done some quick research. Of the 109 Justices of the Supreme \nCourt, my staff counted 55 Supreme Court Justices who could have been \ndefeated if one of the parties had adopted the nuclear option, the \nfilibustering of nominees, now employed by some in the Senate minority. \nHalf of the Supreme Court Justices in our Nation's history might never \nhave served. Who could that have cost us? Benjamin Cardozo, nominated \nby President Hoover, who gave us proximate cause, a cornerstone of \ntoday's tort law. Every college kid in America, including me, read \nCardozo's opinion. How about Justice Marshall Harlan, appointed by \nPresident Hayes. He was the lone dissenter in Plessy v. Ferguson which \nupheld segregation policies. Fortunately, we did not force Justices \nCardozo or Harlan or other Justices to overcome a partisan filibuster. \nIt was not done. In fact, not only did we not filibuster the other \nparty's nominees, we often elevated them, as was the case with Harlan \nFiske Stone, who was appointed by a conservative President, Calvin \nCoolidge, and then elevated to Chief Justice by Franklin D. Roosevelt.\n  I could go on. Does anybody in this Chamber doubt in today's \nenvironment that William O. Douglas would never have made it to the \nSupreme Court, that his nomination would have been filibustered? Does \nanyone in this Chamber doubt for a moment today that Justices Antonin \nScalia and William Rehnquist would not have a chance to serve on the \nSupreme Court because of a filibuster?\n  We have to think about the consequences of this dangerous precedent \nthat unlimited debate be used to deprive the whole Senate of an up-or-\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\ndown vote. The consequences are that individuals with strong opinions--\nand they may be liberal or conservative--and great intellect would not \nhave an up-or-down vote.\n  There has been an ebb and flow in American politics.\n  The Bible says there is a time for every season. There are Republican \nPresidents. There are Democratic Presidents. There is ultimately a \nbalance. What is happening today, what happened last year with the \nunprecedented filibustering of judicial nominees was an attempt to \nchange the Constitution, to require a supermajority for Supreme Court \nand circuit court nominees. We are changing the flow, changing the \nbalance. We are getting rid of and will deprive this Nation of people \nwith great intellect and passion because they won't be able to get past \nthe roadblock of the minority.\n  The caution I hope some in the minority will take to heart is, what \nhappens when the shoe is on the other foot. How would they feel if a \nfuture Democratic President's nominees were treated in the same \nfashion? In this body, we have to live with the precedents we set. The \nwhole concept of due process is about guaranteeing a set of procedures \nwhich reach a fair outcome. It is not about guaranteeing one particular \noutcome.\n  Some in the minority are so bent on defeating a few of the \nPresident's nominees that they will distort the process to achieve the \noutcome. They will distort precedent and tradition. They will distort \nwhat has given us a balance of great intellect and passion and great \nminds on the Supreme Court. We will lose that. That would be a terrible \nthing.\n  We are stewards not only of government but of the Constitution. It is \nour solemn oath to maintain the orderly completion of the Senate's \nbusiness, specifically the fulfillment of our constitutional \nresponsibility. Today, we are on the cusp of having to assert the \nconstitutional option. I hope it will not come to that.\n  Now I hear rhetoric from some Members of the minority that they are \nprepared to compound their error by killing the remainder of the jobs \nagenda that we are ready to pass in the Senate. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers said this week that passage of the jobs \nagenda items--including the highway bill, the Energy bill, the asbestos \nreform bill, and telecom rewrite--would be a $1 trillion jolt to the \nAmerican economy, to the U.S. manufacturing industry. Any Senator from \nStates that don't need manufacturing jobs should feel free to object.\n  We need to focus not on the process but the result. I have a \nresponsibility to advise and consent on the appellate judges the \nPresident has submitted. I will exercise that responsibility whether \nthere be a Democratic President or a Republican President. I will look \nto their qualifications and then give them what they deserve: an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  If need be, I support my leadership taking necessary steps to allow \nme to reach that constitutional decision with a simple up-or-down vote. \nThat is all we are asking for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5010-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5010-S5011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VACANCIES ON THE SIXTH CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the last 4 years, I have taken to \nthe Senate floor from time to time to decry the crushing burden under \nwhich the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals operates. The year has \nchanged, but one seemingly immutable fact remains: The Sixth Circuit is \nthe slowest judicial circuit in the country by far.\n  The Sixth Circuit has 16 seats. It covers Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, \nand Tennessee, with a population of over 30 million people. For the \nlast 3 years, the Sixth Circuit has been trying to function with 25 \npercent of its seats empty. Twenty-five percent of the Sixth Circuit is \nvacant. The vacancy rate is, as it has been for much of this dispute, \nthe highest of any circuit in the Nation.\n  Not surprisingly, the judicial conference has declared all four of \nthese vacant seats to be judicial emergencies. According to the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts, last year, as the year before it, \nthe Sixth Circuit was a full 60 percent behind the national average. \nAccording to AOC, the national average for disposing of an appeal is \n10\\1/2\\ months, but in the Sixth Circuit, it takes almost 17 months to \ndecide an appeal, 16.8 months. That means that in other circuits, if \nyou file your appeal at the beginning of the year, you get your \ndecision around Halloween. But in the Sixth Circuit, if you file your \nappeal at the same time, you get your decision after the following \nMemorial Day, over a half a year later.\n  As the obstruction drags on year after year after year, things have \ngone from bad to worse. In 2001 and 2002, the Sixth Circuit was also \nthe slowest circuit in the country. In those years, the average time \nfor decision in the Sixth Circuit was 15.3 and 16 months respectively. \nIn 2003, the average length of time for decision in the Sixth Circuit \njumped to almost 17 months, 16.8--again, the slowest in the country.\n  I guess things have now hit rock bottom because the AOC reports that \nlast year, 2004, the Sixth Circuit suffered from the same delay, almost \n17 months, 16.8. Yet again, it was the slowest circuit in the Nation.\n  We all know the old saying that justice delayed is justice denied. \nThe 30 million residents of the Sixth Circuit have been denied justice \ndue to the continued obstruction of Sixth Circuit nominees by our \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  What is the reason for this sorry state of affairs? An \nintradelegation spat from years ago when a quarter of the current \nSenate wasn't even here, nor was the current President. This dispute \ndrags on year after year after year. I don't know who started it. I do \nknow that with respect to nominees not getting hearings, the Democrats \ndo not have a monopoly on disappointment. I also know that the \nobstruction that some of my colleagues are practicing on the Sixth \nCircuit is out of proportion to any alleged grievance.\n  My Democratic colleagues continue to block four Sixth Circuit \nnominees from Michigan: Henry Saad, David McKeague, Richard Griffin, \nand Susan Neilson. They are also blocking three district court \nnominees: Thomas Ludington, Dan Ryan, and Sean Cox. In fact, no Federal \njudges from Michigan have been confirmed during the Bush \nadministration. Of the seven vacancies the Democrats refuse to let the \nSenate fill, five of the seats were not even involved in this dispute. \nLet me repeat that. Of the seven vacancies the Democrats from Michigan \nwill not let be filled, five of the seven were not even involved in \nwhatever this ancient dispute was.\n  President Clinton never nominated anyone to the seat to which Henry \nSaad was nominated. The seat to which David McKeague was nominated did \nnot even become vacant until the current Bush administration on August \n15 of 2001, and the three district court seats that are being blocked \nare not involved in the dispute, either. So five of the seven seats had \nabsolutely nothing to do whatever with this dispute that went back to \nthe Clinton years.\n  What the Michigan Senators are doing is holding up one-fourth of an \nentire circuit in crisis, along with three district court seats, \nbecause of internal disputes about two seats, the genesis of which \noccurred years and years ago. This is an absolutely embarrassing \nsituation.\n  What are our friends from Michigan demanding in order to lift the \nblockade? They want to pick circuit court appointments. Let's get back \nto first principles. As much as they would like, Democratic Senators do \nnot get to pick circuit court judges in Republican administrations. In \nfact, as much as we would like on this side of the aisle, Republican \nSenators do not get to pick circuit court judges in Republican \nadministrations. In short, circuit court appointments are not \nSenatorial picks. Article II, section 2, of the Constitution clearly \nprovides that the President and the President alone nominates judges. \nIt then adds that the Senate is to provide its advice and consent to \nthe nominations the President has made. By tradition, the President may \nconsult with Senators if he chooses, but the tradition of consultation \ndoes not transform individual Senators into co-Presidents. We have \nelections for that, and President Bush has won the last two.\n  Finally, the Democrats have recently indicated that they will afford \nthree of the circuit nominees an up-or-down\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nvote along with one of the other filibustered nominees if we abandon \nour efforts to ensure that all nominees receive an up-or-down vote. The \nDemocrats don't care which of the other four nominees are put on the \nbench because they let us pick the nominee.\n  Well, we are not going to toy with these people's careers. They have \nwaited patiently for years to receive the simple dignity of an up-or-\ndown vote, and we are working to restore the norms and traditions of \nthe Senate that existed prior to the previous Congress so they may \nreceive one. But the fact that our Democratic colleagues are now \nwilling to afford one or more of the individual filibustered nominees \nthe courtesy of an up-or-down vote but not allow the same nominees \ncollectively to receive up-or-down votes shows that our Democratic \ncolleagues recognize that each of these nominees is deserving of an up-\nor-down vote. More than that, it shows the partisan and political \nnature of the opposition.\n  Last year, our Democratic colleagues said all seven of these judicial \nnominees were ``too extreme.'' Now they say only three are too extreme. \nSo one of the following three statements is true: The nominees changed, \nor the Democrats' definition of what constitutes extremism has changed, \nor they never really meant it in the first place. Let me repeat that. \nOne of three things is true: Either the nominees who were extreme last \nyear are not extreme this year, the Democrats' definition of what \nconstitutes extremism changed between last year and this year, or they \nnever really meant it in the first place.\n  It is no wonder many people concluded that what is at work is really \njust partisan politics. Mr. President, we should not play partisan \ngames with the nomination process. We should take our constitutional \nduties seriously.\n  I ask our Democratic colleagues to afford these nominees collectively \nwhat they are willing to afford each of them individually; that is, a \nsimple up-or-down vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Reid \nfrom Nevada be added as a cosponsor of S. 467, the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Extension Act of 2005, introduced by my friend, Senator Dodd \nof Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we still live in America, and \nparticularly in my city of New York, in the shadow of 9/11, of the \nterrorism that occurred. Obviously, the thousands of families who have \nhad a loved one taken from their midst live with it every moment of \ntheir remaining lives, but the rest of us live with it, too, not only \nin empathy for them but also in terms of the economic consequences of \nterrorism.\n  The bottom line is very simple, and that is, because of terrorism, \nthe insurance industry, in terms of insuring risk of large structures \nin America--whether it be large buildings that make us so proud of the \nManhattan skyline, or large arenas such as the football stadiums that \ndot America, or larger facilities such as Disneyland, Disney World, and \namusement parks--all have difficulty getting insurance.\n  Insurers are worried that if, God forbid, another terrorist act \noccurs it will be so devastating that it will put them out of business. \nSo they either provide no insurance or provide it at such a high rate \nbecause of the downside risk. Small as it may be--and we hope it is--it \nis still possible that an act so enormous that if, God forbid, it \noccurs, they do not want to be involved.\n  So 2 years ago, the Senate, House, and the President got together at \nsort of the end of the day and passed terrorism risk insurance. It has \nbeen a large success. Insurance rates have come down, terrorism \ninsurance is available, and insurance companies know if, God forbid, \nthe worst happens there will be a backstop, and they are willing to \nissue policies. In turn, that means developers, builders who want to \nbuild new large structures in America, will do so, employing thousands \nand thousands of people, creating profits and new businesses as well.\n\n  We now come to the fact that this legislation expires--it was passed \nas an experiment; those who were dubious of it said, Let's see how it \nworks--in December. But the urgency to act is much sooner than December \nbecause policies are not written for 6 months. If right now you are a \nbusiness and you want to renew your insurance against risk for 1 year \nor 2 years or 3 years, that policy would go beyond December.\n  What the insurers say to many is, ``I will raise your rate \ndramatically'', which will raise costs and shut down construction, or \n``I will not insure you at all'', which certainly shuts down \nconstruction. It means nothing will get built. So we should move this \nlegislation quickly.\n  I stress we do not need to repeat last year by delaying and delaying. \nLast year, we began to witness, when we delayed a great deal, a loss in \neconomic activity in the larger cities of this country in particular, \neven though we were well aware that ultimately this had to be done.\n  There are really only two alternatives. One is going to be no \nterrorism insurance. The private market will not fill the gap. That \nwill prevent tens of billions in projects from going forward this \nsummer and this fall, not next year but right now.\n  The second is that the market will fill the gap but only at such \nextraordinary prices and only in unique situations that the same thing \nwould happen.\n  Why are we sitting in the Senate and in the House twiddling our \nthumbs? Our economy is squishy, oil prices are up, other economies \noutside of Asia are down, including Japan's actually, and, therefore, \nwe are worried about the economy, and here we are putting another log \non the tracks in the way of economic recovery.\n  There can be no dispute that terrorism insurance works, and there can \nbe no dispute that if we do not renew it, there will be trouble. The \nratings agencies have said in no uncertain terms that come December 31, \nif there is no terrorism insurance, they are not going to be able to \ngive any kind of decent rating to any insurance offer.\n  These guys are insurers. They look for risk. They live with risk. \nThey wake up in the morning thinking a risk, they go to sleep at night \nthinking a risk. We can say, oh, well, and have an ideological debate \nabout how much should the Government be involved, or we can say, \nactually, people are not as worried about terrorism. It does not matter \nwhat you think, Mr. President, or what I think, it is what these \ninsurers think. If the rating agencies say they are not going to give a \ndecent rate to insurers, it is over, and we will not have it.\n  Moody's noted in an insurance brokers report that up to 75 percent of \nthe policies written since January 1 have adopted a conditional \nendorsement that voids terrorism coverage if TRIA is not renewed. As we \ngo through the year, the number of endorsements, they said, is expected \nto increase.\n  The report specifically stated these conditional endorsements appear \nto be an indication that unless terrorism insurance is renewed, premium \nspikes or a sharp reduction in the availability of coverage may result.\n  The report warns--this is very important--that Moody's is unaware of \nany viable private market initiative that would take the place of TRIA.\n  There are some who say: Let it expire and let's see what the market \ndoes. That is taking a huge risk because if the market does not come \nin, then we have hurt construction workers, laborers, and all those \nwho would work in these buildings.\n\n  Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, is a very well-\nrespected voice around here, as he should be, in my opinion. He is a \nfree-market guy. He does not like Government involvement. Right now, I \nam going toe to toe with him about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He would \nlike to curb their role because he does not like the Government \ninvolved. I think they are needed in the housing market. But on\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\nterrorism insurance, even Alan Greenspan admits it is needed. Here is \nwhat he said:\n\n       This is a very difficult issue, because remember that the \n     private markets work exceptionally efficiently in a civilized \n     society in which domestic violence or violence coming from \n     abroad is not a central factor.\n       You cannot have a voluntary market system and the creation \n     of markets, especially insurance markets, in a society \n     subject to unanticipated violence. And as a consequence, \n     there are certain types of costs, which is what we have the \n     Defense Department protecting us from, which we essentially \n     choose to socialize.\n       The less of that we have, the better off society is.\n\n  Of course, this is his view, and he wants to make sure you know he \ndoes not want us to do this everywhere.\n\n       There are, nonetheless, regrettable instances in which \n     markets do not work, cannot work. And while I think you can \n     get some semblance of terrorism insurance, I have not been \n     persuaded that this market works terribly well.\n\n  It is pretty clear, we need to renew this legislation, and it is \nlikely we will renew it. What is so incredible is we are waiting and \nwaiting, and every day we wait causes damage to jobs and the economy.\n  The bottom line is that financial dislocation caused by another \npossible terrorist attack--God forbid--is too much for our country to \nrisk. I urge the entire Senate to pass this legislation quickly. It is \ncosponsored by 25 of my colleagues, and we should move it without delay \nand let the markets, let the insurance world, and, most of all, let \njobs and construction go forth.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Terrorism Risk \nInsurance Act, or TRIA. This law is necessary to make our economy \nfunction smoothly and effectively and to protect it from the risk of a \nterrorist attack.\n  After 9/11, we enacted a number of measures including the Terrorism \nRisk Insurance Act, to enhance and stabilize the security of our \ncitizens and our economy. TRIA provided a high-level Federal backstop \nthat allowed private insurance and reinsurance markets to return and to \nallow American businesses to overcome the shock of September 11. TRIA \nseems to have performed exactly as we intended, but as we all know the \nprogram expires at the end of this year. I am getting concerned that we \nare fast approaching the point where we need to move forward and \nreauthorize the TRIA. We can't allow this program to expire without a \nshort-term extension or longer term solution to be put in place.\n  But as we consider whether to extend TRIA, we should look closer at \nthe two main goals we tried to accomplish with the law. First, as I \njust noted, we wanted to make sure that the market and the economy \nfunctioned in the wake of 9/11 and in the face of the threat of terror. \nAfter 9/11, the insurance companies looked at their risk for the first \ntime in the context of a mass casualty destructive act that would \ndestroy buildings, that would kill perhaps thousands of people, and \nthey decided that they alone could not take this risk. In light of the \nnew conditions, the passage of TRIA, provided a necessary backstop, and \nallowed the private insurance companies and the market to function \neffectively.\n  One of the areas that I became concerned about was workman's \ncompensation. Most people would say: What does that have to do with a \nmajor attack that falls upon a large building or a major city or some \nother key facility? The point is thousands of workers are covered by \nworkman's compensation. Those deaths and injuries would trigger \nworkman's compensation. That is just one example of the situation \ncaused by 9/11, the situation of uncertainty, the situation of \npotentially huge losses which never before were fully calculated by the \ninsurance companies. That part of the purpose of TRIA has worked very \nwell. Our insurance markets are functioning smoothly today.\n  But there is a second important reason, and that second important \nreason is that many of us felt that we needed to have a policy in place \nall the time to allow the economy to rebound more quickly in the \nunfortunate event of another terrorist attack here in the United \nStates.\n  Let me just remind you, as we left this Chamber yesterday morning, as \nwe moved to assembly areas, as we evacuated all these buildings, the \nnotion of a further terrorist attack was not something hypothetical or \nremote. For an instant there, there was real concern that we would be \nstruck again. And if we are struck again and we do not have in place a \nterrorism reinsurance program, the insurance industry will once again \nface the same dilemma we saw on 9/11: we can't cover these risks; we \nare overexposed; we can't provide insurance in the future. That slows \nthe economy down and potentially in many different ways. TRIA has to be \nin place. As long as we are sincerely persuaded that there is a \nterrorist threat, and I know I am, then we have to have this TRIA \nprogram in place.\n  Some opponents of the extension argue that TRIA should be a temporary \nprogram because by ending it private terrorism insurance markets will \nbe forced to stabilize and provide adequate capacity to meet the demand \nfor coverage. I do not think that will happen. I think the markets will \nstabilize because companies will not write risks. And if you are trying \nto build a major building in a major city, guess what? Try to get \ninsurance. If you propose to put in a major office complex with \nthousands of workers, try to get workman's compensation insurance. You \nwill not get it. That is the way the market will respond to the \nuncertainty caused by the potential attack of terror, and that will \nhurt our economy grievously. I think we have to recall and realize that \nwe still are under the threat. I think we have to also be conversant \nwith the fact that there will be dramatic economic effect even if a \nsmall attack is waged by terrorists because the psychological dimension \nis just as important in many respects as the physical damage. So we \nhave to have in place this terrorism reinsurance program, and we are \nrunning out of time to do it right, carefully, thoroughly, and get it \ndone before the end of the year. As you may know, the Treasury \nDepartment is required to report to Congress by June 30 of 2005 on \nissues associated with the act and its purposes. While I am looking \nforward to the conclusion of the Treasury Department study, it will \nhave little, if anything, to do with the second aim of the law; namely, \nhaving a policy in place in the event there is another attack in the \nUnited States.\n  It is this ``preparedness'' reason that most compels me to believe \nthat we need to continue a Federal terrorism insurance program. This \nCongress, Senator Dodd and Senator Bennett reintroduced the extension \nbill, S. 467, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor. In addition to extending TRIA to \n2007, this bill establishes a Presidential working group on financial \nmarkets to submit a report to Congress containing recommendations to \naddress the long-term availability and affordability of terrorism risk \ninsurance.\n  The administration thus far has been silent on extending TRIA. It is \nessential that the administration lead rather than follow in this \nprocess of legislative deliberation. Furthermore, vacancies in key \nadministration positions have led to a vacuum in leadership and \ncommunication needed for good policymaking as we approach deliberations \non TRIA. Extending TRIA is absolutely the right thing to protect the \neconomic security of our country. I urge my colleagues to take a close \nlook at this legislation and join us in supporting it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks a written statement that I \nsubmitted at a symposium sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on \nextending the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, or TRIA, and a letter \nsigned by seventy-four CEOs of the largest integrated financial \nservices companies in\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\nthe country which provide banking, insurance and investment products \nand a second letter from the Coalition to Insure Against Terrorism, \nCIAT, which represents over seventy-five companies and major \nassociations, a virtual cross section of the U.S. economy, both of \nwhich express strong support for extending the terrorism insurance \nprogram.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 2002 I co-sponsored, and Congress passed, \nthe Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, commonly referred to as TRIA. This \nimportant legislation provided a government backstop for the terrorism \ninsurance market that disappeared after the attacks of September 11. \nTRIA is working. Today, because of TRIA, terrorism risk insurance is \navailable and businesses have meaningful access to coverage. The \nprimary purpose behind TRIA, and the reason it needs to be extended, is \nto make sure that the American economy and markets function in the face \nof a terrorist threat. There needs to be a mechanism in place to allow \nthe economy to rebound more quickly and to protect American jobs in the \nunfortunate event of another terrorist attack here in the United \nStates. The threat of an attack has not gone away and will not go away \nwhen TRIA expires at the end of 2005.\n  While some in Washington continue to hope that a private market will \ndevelop in the absence of TRIA, let me quote from two reports put out \nrecently by those who are in the business of watching markets. The \nfirst is a Special Report by the rating agency Moody's Investors \nservice dated April 28 which expressed concern about the potential \neffects of the pending expiration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, \nTRIA.\n  Moody's noted, that insurance brokers report that up to 75 percent of \npolicies written since January 1st have adopted a conditional \nendorsement that automatically voids terrorism coverage if TRIA is not \nrenewed, and that the number of conditional endorsements is expected to \nincrease as the year progresses. The report stated, ``These conditional \nendorsements appear to be an indication that unless TRIA is renewed, \npremium spikes, or a sharp reduction in availability of coverage, may \nresult. The report warns, ``Moody's is unaware of any viable private \nmarket initiative that would take the place of TRIA.''\n  Secondly, Marsh Inc., in a report released on April 25, entitled \nMarketwatch: Terrorism Insurance 2005, concludes: ``If TRIA is not \nextended, the stand-alone insurance market is unlikely to have \nsufficient capacity to satisfy all of the expected demand at \ncommercially viable prices.''\n  The Bush administration official who spoke at the recent U.S. Chamber \nsymposium on TRIA simply gave those in attendance a history lesson on \nthe issue, but refused to give any indication whether the \nadministration would support or oppose an extension of TRIA. Policy \nholders from major sectors of the economy--real estate, financial \nservices, energy, entertainment, hotel, and hospital industries--feel \nlike they are being left to twist in the wind wondering whether the \nadministration and the Congress are going to take the necessary action \nso that they can properly and responsibly protect their properties. \nThere is absolutely no sense of urgency by this White House and I think \nthey would like to see this issue quietly go away.\n  The financial dislocation caused by another possible terrorist attack \nis too important to ignore and we should not continue to delay action \non an issue that is so important to our economy and the American \nworkforce. We should act on extending TRIA and act promptly.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Chamber of Commerce Terrorism Reinsurance Conference\n\n\n                     Remarks by Senator Harry Reid\n\n                       (Thursday, March 17, 2005)\n\n       I was a co-sponsor of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \n     (TRIA), which Congress passed in 2002, and I strongly agree \n     with many of you, that we need to extend this important \n     program as soon as possible.\n       After the attacks of September 11th, private insurance was \n     no longer available to cover losses caused by terrorist \n     attacks. It became impossible to purchase property and \n     casualty insurance to cover losses to real property and the \n     people in those buildings because the risk was too difficult \n     to measure. This created serious problems in the real estate \n     and commercial development sectors and essentially stopped \n     construction of new buildings because banks would not loan \n     money for projects that could not be insured.\n       When a meaningful market for terrorism insurance failed to \n     develop after several months, it became clear that Congress \n     needed to do something to prevent continued disruption to the \n     economy.\n       We passed TRIA and it is working today.\n       Because of TRIA, terrorism risk insurance is available and \n     businesses have meaningful access to coverage. I don't think \n     we can underestimate its impact on the economic recovery we \n     have seen in Nevada and other parts of the country.\n       As you know, TRIA is set to expire at the end of 2005. Its \n     looming expiration has huge implications for our economy and \n     job creation. Already I have heard reports that insurance \n     providers will not write terrorism insurance policies in \n     large, metropolitan markets such as Las Vegas, Chicago and \n     Washington, DC in light of TRIA's near expiration. I regret \n     that this is taking place, and I worry about the impact this \n     will have on our economy if the insurance they need is not \n     available.\n       The White House seems to be content on waiting for the \n     Treasury Department's report on the terrorism insurance \n     market before making any decision. That report is not due \n     until June 30th. That's too late and waiting until this \n     summer to make a decision creates too much uncertainty for \n     the real estate, construction and insurance industries.\n       When many of us voted for TRIA, we did so for two principle \n     reasons. First, we wanted to make sure that the markets \n     functioned in the face of the threat of terrorism. We wanted \n     to restart the construction industry and get people back to \n     work. But the second important reason for this legislation--\n     and I believe President Bush stated this when he signed the \n     bill into law--was that many of us felt that we needed to \n     have a policy in place to allow the economy to rebound more \n     quickly in the unfortunate event of another terrorist attack \n     here in the United States. We felt that having an insurance \n     program in place would ensure that economic activity would \n     continue after a terrorist attack.\n       And this second reason is why I am so concerned about the \n     President's ``wait and see'' approach to extending TRIA. The \n     Treasury department's study--whatever it finds--is only \n     focusing on the first reason that TRIA was put in place. It \n     has little, if anything, to do with the second reason for the \n     Act.\n       It is this ``preparedness'' reason that is the real \n     convincing reason that causes me to say we need to continue a \n     Federal terrorism insurance program, and we do not have to \n     wait for the Treasury department to further the debate on \n     that.\n       I also support inclusion of group life coverage in the TRIA \n     bill when it is reauthorized. There continues to be a lack of \n     available catastrophe reinsurance coverage for the group life \n     insurance industry and the absence of reinsurance coverage \n     poses a significant risk for the 156 million American \n     families who rely on the promised survivor benefits of their \n     group life insurance policies.\n       If the President is serious about creating jobs and \n     maintaining the health of the U.S. economy, he needs to get \n     behind efforts to extend this law now. Otherwise, it is just \n     not going to happen. American businesses are already being \n     told by insurers that they face the prospect of going without \n     terrorism coverage by year-end.\n       Prior to TRIA's enactment in 2002, $15 billion in real \n     estate transactions were cancelled or put on hold because \n     there was no terrorism insurance available. Commercial \n     construction was at a six-year low. According to the White \n     House, over 300,000 construction jobs were lost or put on \n     hold because there was no terrorism insurance available. Bond \n     rating agencies downgraded $12.5 billion worth of commercial \n     mortgage-backed securities because of the lack of available \n     terrorism insurance. Lenders began to ``force place'' \n     terrorism insurance coverage on many properties, despite the \n     fact the only available terrorism coverage was deficient, \n     defective and priced at levels that negatively affected the \n     economics of the underlying properties.\n       Extending TRIA makes good economic sense, and I hope the \n     White House and my Republican colleagues who control its fate \n     will work with our caucus and move swiftly to extend it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            The Financial Services Roundtable,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2005.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Frist, Speaker Hastert, Minority \n     Leader Reid and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are writing in \n     support of an extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act \n     (TRIA).\n       The Financial Services Roundtable represents 100 of the \n     largest integrated financial services companies providing \n     banking, insurance, and investment products and services to \n     the American consumer.\n       TRIA is not likely the long term answer to how policy \n     holders, insurers and the government deal with terrorism \n     coverage. It is,\n\n[[Page S5014]]\n\n     however, a program that keeps policy holders from bankruptcy, \n     insurers from insolvency, and taxpayers from paying the full \n     cost of a catastrophic terrorist event. From this standpoint, \n     it has been a success and it is essential that the program be \n     extended for a determinant period of time.\n       An extension should meet the following principles:\n       It should extend the current program for a reasonable \n     period of time;\n       It should hold retention levels at the current program \n     limit;\n       It should provide a backstop for group life policies; and\n       It should require stakeholders to determine the nature of a \n     public private partnership going forward (including, \n     specifically, a study of how to deal with threats posed by \n     nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological attacks).\n       We recognize that TRIA is not working perfectly for all \n     stakeholders. For some insurers the retention levels require \n     companies to underwrite as if the program does not exist, and \n     any increase in retention levels will render the program \n     useless. But we believe that TRIA has helped to stave off the \n     economic dislocation that could have filled the vacuum left \n     by drain of insurance industry capital post-9/11. In \n     instances where states have granted exclusions, insurers who \n     otherwise could have walked away from this type of risk have \n     not because of TRIA. In states where no exclusion exists, or \n     for those carriers who write worker compensation coverage, \n     the backstop is insurance against insolvency.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important issue. \n     Please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of \n     assistance on this or other issues.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   Steve Bartlett,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n       Also signed by 74 others.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Coalition To Insure\n\n\n                                            Against Terrorism,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 26, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Reid: The Coalition to Insure Against \n     Terrorism (CIAT), a broad-based coalition of business \n     insurance policyholders representing a significant segment of \n     the nation's GDP, strongly supports S. 467, the Terrorism \n     Risk Insurance Extension Act of 2005, introduced by Senators \n     Bennett and Dodd. As the principal consumers of this vital \n     insurance coverage, CIAT urges you to cosponsor this \n     important legislation.\n       With the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) set to expire \n     at year-end, there is no evidence to suggest that insurance \n     markets will be able to provide adequate insurance against \n     catastrophic acts of terrorism without a federal reinsurance \n     backstop. Based on recent testimony from senior \n     Administration officials, the threat of terrorism within our \n     homeland remains as high as it did on 9/11. Earlier this \n     year, CIA Director Porter Goss said before the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee: ``It may be only a matter of time \n     before al-Qa'ida or another group attempts to use chemical, \n     biological, radiological and nuclear weapons'', and ``al-\n     Qa'ida is intent on finding ways to circumvent U.S. security \n     enhancements to strike Americans and the Homeland.''\n       This stark reality, together with the unique factors that \n     make the terrorist threat akin to the risk from war, \n     continues to prevent insurers from effectively modeling and \n     pricing the risk of future catastrophic terrorism attacks, \n     thereby seriously hampering the development of any viable \n     catastrophic reinsurance alternatives to TRIA.\n       To date, the terrorism reinsurance program established by \n     TRIA has achieved the goals envisioned by President Bush and \n     bipartisan leaders in Congress in 2002. First, it has helped \n     keep the economy going in the face of continued terrorist \n     threats by ensuring that businesses across America can secure \n     this essential coverage, saving countless jobs in the \n     process. Second, it serves as an important tool to minimize \n     the severe economic disruption that almost certainly will \n     occur should there be a future terrorist attack of \n     catastrophic proportion.\n       S. 467 would extend the current TRIA program for a short \n     period of time while also creating a group of insurance and \n     risk management experts to work with the Presidential Working \n     Group on Financial Markets to develop a longer-term solution. \n     If enacted, this legislation will ensure that the nation's \n     workers and businesses will be able to secure adequate and \n     affordable insurance coverage against terrorism after year-\n     end, and that the nation has a sound policy in place to \n     enable the economy to quickly recover should another \n     terrorist attack occur in the U.S.\n       CIAT believes that it is absolutely critical that Congress \n     act quickly to extend the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) \n     beyond December 31, 2005. Extending TRIA is an essential part \n     of our nation's economic preparedness against terrorism, as \n     well as an essential element of our nation's economic \n     security. With only a few months left, American businesses \n     and property owners face the threat of going without adequate \n     and affordable terrorism insurance coverage next year. \n     Without a federal terrorism risk reinsurance program in \n     place, our economy will be needlessly disrupted and \n     significant U.S. economic interests and jobs are likely to be \n     exposed to the uninsured costs of a major terrorist event.\n       To this end, CIAT respectfully requests that you cosponsor \n     S. 467.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           The Coalition To Insure\n     Against Terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5014-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3) to authorize funds for Federal-aid \n     highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Inhofe amendment No. 605, to provide a complete substitute.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 652 (to amendment No. 605), to provide \n     for the conduct of an investigation to determine whether \n     market manipulation is contributing to higher gasoline \n     prices.\n       Nelson (FL) (for Feingold) amendment No. 610 (to amendment \n     No. 605) to improve the accuracy and efficacy of identity \n     authentication systems and ensure privacy and security.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the Senator from Oklahoma \nand the Senator from Vermont or their designees prior to the vote on \nthe motion to invoke cloture on the pending substitute amendment.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, those of us who are in the managing \npositions want to explain what it is about and why the cloture is very \nimportant. However, we do want to accommodate the Senator from Arizona, \nwho is busy with a markup right now, and if there is no objection, I \nwould recognize him for up to 8 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma and the \nSenator from Missouri for their courtesy, and I will try to be brief in \nmy statement.\n  Nearly 50 years ago, the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 was enacted \ninto law. As I mentioned during last year's debate, the 1956 act added \nup to a mere 29 pages--a tiny fraction of this year's highway bill. But \nwhat it accomplished truly changed this country. The act created \nprograms that led to the construction of the Interstate Highway System, \nthe largest civil works project ever undertaken by the United States. \nThe 1956 act was the brainchild of President Eisenhower to establish \nthe highway trust fund, financed by taxes on gasoline to fund this \nmassive undertaking. The act required the construction of an interstate \nhighway system using a uniform design that would be safer than most \nU.S. highways in existence at that time.\n  Mr. President, today we are all the beneficiaries of the foresight of \nPresident Eisenhower and of the Congress that helped to shepherd the \nlegislation through to enactment. The Interstate System today is 47,000 \nmiles long, comprised of 62 superhighways crisscrossing the Nation in a \ngrid. Twenty-four percent of all travel occurs on the interstates, and \nthe system has obtained a record of being twice as safe as other \nhighways.\n  Unfortunately, when people look back 50 years from now at the highway \nlegislation that the Senate will consider shortly, I doubt that history \nwill remember this as having helped improve on President Eisenhower's \n``grand plan.'' We are no longer focused on building a unified \ntransportation system to improve the safety, security, and economy of \nour Nation as a whole. Instead, we are faced with legislation that \nredistributes funding to the States in an unfair manner.\n  Approximately every 6 years we reauthorize our Nation's multiyear \nhighway, transit, and safety programs. We last reauthorized these \nprograms in 1998 with the enactment of TEA-21 following extensive \ndebate in the Senate. In the 108th Congress we did not reauthorize \nthese programs, and, instead, Congress passed a series of short-term \nextensions of TEA-21, and this happened for good reason. The bill \nbrought to the Senate floor in the last Congress would have increased \noverall funding to $318 billion, $100 billion over the TEA-21 enacted \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\n  I commend the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee \nfor reducing the authorized number to match the President's fiscal 2006 \nbudget proposal of $284 billion in the version of the bill reported by \nhis committee. Reduction in the overall size of the bill was a \nsignificant improvement over the legislation presented to the Senate \nlast year. Fiscal discipline is a key component of this debate. As Alan \nGreenspan warned some days ago, ``Under existing tax rates and \nreasonable assumptions about other spending, projections make clear \nthat the Federal budget is on an unsustainable path in which large \ndeficits result in rising interest rates and ever growing interest \npayments that augment deficits in future years.''\n\n  We need to control our spending. We must. And that is why the overall \nsize of this bill should not be inflated. We are considering a \nsubstitute amendment to the bill that as proposed increases obligations \nby $11 billion, and I think that is wrong.\n  According to the Statement of Administration Policy regarding the \nhighway bill, ``Should the obligation or net authorization levels that \nwould result from the final bill exceed (that amount), the President's \nsenior advisors will recommend that he veto the bill.''\n  Apparently, we are now going to test whether the President will veto \nthe bill.\n  Fiscal prudence is crucial, but even if the conferees act sensibly \nand recognize the need for an agreement that would be acceptable to the \nPresident, that alone would not make the legislation adequate.\n  Equity is also crucial and, unfortunately, the highway bill that is \nbefore us retains unfair features of past bills. In some cases, it is \neven more unfair than last year's legislation. This year's highway bill \nperpetuates the historical discrepancy between donor States and donee \nStates.\n  Remarkably, not only does the bill continue the disparity, it \nactually exacerbates it. Whereas the bill that was passed last year by \nthe Senate would have increased theoretically every State's rate of \nreturn to 95 percent in the final year of the bill, the substitute \namendment before the Senate only promises a rate of 92 percent in 2009 \nfor those States. Until then many States would linger at a rate of \nreturn of 90.5 in the first year and 91 percent thereafter while others \nreceive more--in some cases much more than what they contribute to the \nhighway trust fund. As if that were not enough, this year's bill would \nactually propose to create further disparities between States. Although \n``equity'' is in the title of the legislation, the number of donor \nStates would increase from 28 under current law to 31. Under the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee's so-called formula, which is \nless a formula than it is a series of calculations consisting of \narbitrary funding caps and floors, some States would actually receive a \ngreater rate of return than they would have under last year's bill, \ndespite the fact that this year's overall funding is less. That is \nremarkable.\n  My colleagues may wonder how this is possible, and they may question \nmy facts. But as hard as this may be to believe, it is true. For \nexample, the State of Missouri, which currently receives a rate of \nreturn of 91 percent, would have received an increased rate of return \nof 95 percent immediately and then throughout the reauthorization. \nUnder the substitute amendment before us, Missouri will go from a rate \nof return of 91 percent to 99 percent immediately.\n  Despite Missouri's good fortune, five States would continue to linger \nat the bottom of the barrel for 4 years. In the fifth year, at least \ntheoretically, these States would increase their rates of return to 92 \npercent, a modest increase of 1.5 percent over current law; 1.5 percent \nwhen other States enjoy a rate of return of over 200 percent, in one \ncase almost 530 percent, in that final year. They say that beggars \ncan't be choosers, but this legislation shouldn't be passed solely to \nprove that point. States like Arizona, California, and Texas should not \nbe in the position of begging for their fair share of contributions to \nthe highway trust fund.\n  I fully recognize that during the years when the Federal Government \nwas building the interstate system, a redistribution of funding between \nthe States may have made sense. Clearly, it would have been very \ndifficult for the State of Montana, for example, with fewer than a \nmillion people, to pay the full cost of building its share of the \nintestate system. But that era is over. Congress declared the \nconstruction of the interstate system complete in 1991. Yet here we \nare, almost 15 years later, and donor States are still expected to \nagree to the redistribution of hundreds of millions, if not billions, \nof dollars to other States regardless of the already enormous \ntransportation needs of donor States.\n  Let me be clear. Today, the need is in the highest growth States, \nwhich face some of this Nation's toughest transportation challenges. \nAccording to the most recent Census Bureau projections, Florida, Texas, \nand Arizona, all super-donor States receiving the minimum rate of \nreturn, will be among the five fastest-growing States over the next 25 \nyears. Yet the donee States, many with shrinking populations, continue \nto receive growing subsidies from donor States. Meanwhile, States like \nFlorida, Texas, and Arizona, and others including Colorado and Indiana, \nwould be held for no apparent reason at the bottom. Other States, \nincluding Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, \nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia also would continue to get \nshortchanged. This is not the right approach, it is unfair, and we \nshould do everything we can to ensure that any bill voted off this \nfloor is more equitable for all States.\n  Now, I am sure we will hear about the great transportation needs of \nthe States that receive more funds than they contribute. And I have no \ndoubt that those States do, in fact, have significant needs. But how \nwas it determined that California, for example, should have an average \nof $260 million per year of its funding redistributed as the EPW-\nreported bill would direct? Why aren't California's transportation \nneeds as worthy of receiving the same percentage of Federal funds as \nprovided to meet the transportation needs of a State like New York, for \nexample, which is scheduled to receive a rate of return of 111 percent, \nor an average of over $140 million per year more than it contributes. \nThis significant rate of return isn't the product of savvy investment. \nIt is a guaranteed rate of return well above 100 percent that is built \non the backs of donor States.\n  Why should a State like Alaska receive a rate of return in 2009 of \nalmost 530 percent when it currently already receives a return of 500 \npercent? Why should Montana receive a rate of return of almost 228 \npercent, or Vermont a rate of over 212 percent? These figures defy any \nreasonable explanation other than the following: This bill is less \nabout the integrity of our Nation's transportation system than it is \nabout maximizing the amount of money going to some States at the \nexpense of others.\n  I support a long-term reauthorization of our Nation's surface \ntransportation programs and I understand the vital nature of this \nfunding to our States. But before we take action on this bill, I urge \nmy colleagues to start asking questions and to take seriously the \nconsequences of increasing the size of this bill beyond the $284 \nbillion level and of perpetuating the inequitable distribution of funds \nunder this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 636 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside in order to call up Ensign amendment \nNo. 636.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Inhofe], for Mr. Ensign, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 636.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the State of Nevada to continue construction of \n                the US-95 Project in Las Vegas, Nevada)\n\n       On page 410, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. US-95 PROJECT, LAS VEGAS, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the project identified\n\n[[Page S5016]]\n\n     as the preferred alternative in the document entitled ``US-95 \n     Project in Las Vegas, Nevada'', as approved by the Federal \n     Highway Administration on November 18, 1999, and selected in \n     the record of decision dated January 28, 2000, shall be \n     considered to meet all requirements of section 102(2)(C) of \n     the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. \n     4332(2)(C)) and any related laws with respect to the \n     determination contained in the record of decision.\n       (b) Authorization.--The State of Nevada may continue \n     construction of the project described in subsection (a) to \n     completion.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a couple of brief comments. I know \nhow sincere the senior Senator from Arizona is concerning this bill, \nand it does demonstrate that it is very difficult when we are trying to \nbe fair and we are trying to do a formula to make everybody happy. \nProbably every Senator is a little bit unhappy with it. That is what \nmakes it, perhaps, a fair formula.\n  It is true--the Senator was accurate--as far as the history of the \nInterstate System back in the Eisenhower administration and the \nredistribution of funds. This is what we have to keep in mind, though: \nYes, the Interstate System is complete, but it still must be \nmaintained.\n  He talked about the State of Montana. Yes, it is true the State of \nMontana does not have the population to support the highways, and yet \nthey have to have the highway system. That system, even though it may \nbe complete, must be maintained.\n  In defense of the formula, there are two ways of doing this. One way, \nwe could do what has been customary in the other body, and that is come \nout with a group of projects, take care of a certain number of people \nin the passed bill, and then walk away from it. That would be very \neasy.\n  I will tell my colleagues, what would be easy is to go ahead and \ndistribute a bunch of funds to 60 Senators and then sit back and say: \nThe rest of you guys, that is your problem. But we do not do it that \nway. Instead, in looking at the formula and the factors, it is an \nincredibly difficult thing we are dealing with. We have factors that \nhave to do with the donor status of the State, the number of miles in \nthe State, the age of the State, the passthrough provisions of the \nState, and the fatalities per capita of the State. My State of Oklahoma \nhas a higher per capita fatality rate, and therefore one has to come to \nthe conclusion that there is a reason for that. So all of these factors \nare a part of a very complicated formula.\n  It may be that people will look at it and say: You do not treat--it \nis kind of interesting. I will hear from people from the fast growing \nStates who say, We do not get as high as we need to get in our donor \nstatus relief, and yet at the same time we hear from some of the \nEastern States that are complaining because the floor is too low. So I \nwould think that everyone should realize that there is not going to be \na perfect formula that makes everybody happy.\n  It is a formula that is as fair as we can come up with. We have been \nworking on this for 3 years. This is not something that just came out. \nWhen the Senator from Arizona says that last year's bill was guaranteed \nto raise the donor status floor to 95 percent, that is easy because we \nhad the money to do it. This year, we do not have the money to do it. \nEven with the amendment that was passed, all that does is raise it from \n90.5 percent to 92 percent. It is a very difficult thing.\n  I do not want to use up an inordinate amount of time, but I will talk \nabout why we have to do this today. The only alternative to passing a \nbill is to have another extension. If we have another extension, we do \nnot really get into the problem. We do not take care of the donor State \nrate of return. We do not have any of the new safety core programs. We \nhave literally spent months putting this together. Of course, those \nprovisions were in the Commerce Committee. We need to respond to the \ndeaths on the highways. If we do not pass the bill, we are not going to \nhave any kind of streamlining of environmental reviews. We are not \ngoing to have any increase in the ability to use the innovative \nfinancing systems which are included.\n  This bill contains the establishment of a national commission to \nexplore how to fund transportation in the future. As the Senator from \nArizona said, 50 years ago we started this system, back during the \nEisenhower administration. He recognized there was a problem back when \nhe was Major Eisenhower and he was trying to move goods and services \naround. He recognized there was a problem, but we have not changed the \nway we are funding highways for 50 years.\n  This bill establishes a commission to come up with more innovative \nways and allows the States to participate. People are concerned about \nthings such as Safe Routes to School. If we go on an extension instead \nof a bill, we are not going to have Safe Routes to School. There is \nuncertainty that is out there. I know my State of Oklahoma is not any \ndifferent from the rest of the States. We are on our sixth extension \nnow. If we are operating on an extension, it could be a 1-month \nextension, it could be a 1-year extension.\n  There is no certainty by which we can plan the construction and \nmaintenance of highways and do something about the bridges. The bridges \nin Oklahoma are worse than any of the bridges in the Nation. It is a \nlife-and-death situation. People are dying. We have had two deaths \nin Oklahoma just because of the condition of the bridges. So we are \ngoing to have to do something. If we operate on extensions, we are not \ngoing to be able to have any of those improvements.\n\n  As far as the border program, the States that are complaining about \nthis program are actually border States. They are States that have the \nbenefit of some of the provisions to take care of the borders. NAFTA \nhas been passed, and there is increased road travel. We will not have a \nborders program if we do not pass a bill. It would just be an extension \nof the old program.\n  Lastly, the firewall protection--we need to make sure that people \nquit robbing the highway trust fund. I was in disagreement with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, and I said the problem \nwe have been having is people are taking money out of the trust fund \nand using it for purposes to establish and support policies that have \nnothing to do with transportation. These are the things that concern \nme.\n  We want to stay within our timeframe. Before turning to Senator Bond, \nI guess Senator Jeffords is not in the Chamber, so we will turn to \nSenator Baucus. After that, I ask unanimous consent that we stay on \nthis course and first recognize Senator Baucus, and that after his \ncompletion we recognize Senator Bond for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is quite clear, especially based upon \nthe vote on the point of order yesterday where 76 Members of this body \nvoted to waive that point of order indicating their support for this \nprogram, that there is not a lot of controversy remaining on this bill. \nThere are important amendments, clearly, that will be offered by \nMembers, but I believe all of us in this body know that this bill must \nbe passed and must be passed quickly. It should be passed today, and it \nprobably will be passed today, both because it is important and also to \navoid the May 31 date when current law expires. Hopefully, we will get \na conference that will bring back a conference report so we can pass \nthis legislation and send it to the President's desk by that time.\n  There is one point I wish to make, though. There is some concern that \nthis bill is not fair to every State. We hear this in the committee. We \nwho are managing this bill hear that statement often from a lot of \nSenators. I understand it. Every Senator is doing what he or she should \ndo, and that is to fight for his or her State. I compliment those \nSenators. It is our job as managers of the bill and also our job as a \nbody to do the very best we can to be as fair as possible to all \nconcerned and get this legislation passed.\n  I will say a word or two in defense of the Western States that are \nlarge in area but small in population as to why this national highway \nprogram is fair to us--I represent the State of Montana--and why it is \nalso fair to some of the more populous States.\n  We do not have a lot of people in Montana. Our population density is \nabout six people per square mile. There are not very many States with a \npopulation density lower than ours. We are\n\n[[Page S5017]]\n\na huge State in area. In fact, the length across our State of Montana \nis as great as the distance from Washington, DC, to Chicago. It is that \nfar to drive across Montana. In addition, if one were to overlay \nMontana over the New England States, the State of Montana would include \nNew York and all the other New England States, and also include \nPennsylvania. I think it would include about half of New Jersey. So it \nis a large area but very low in population density. The State of \nArizona, for example, has 45 people per square mile. Montana, as I \nmentioned, has about six people per square mile.\n  This is a national program. We are trying to get all States included. \nNew Jersey, I might add, has a population density of about 1,100 people \nper square mile. New York has about 401 people per square mile. Again, \nMontana has six people per square mile. This is a national highway \nprogram. We want Americans to be able to travel freely across all \nStates, the more populated States and also the less populated \nStates. We want our commerce to travel nationwide, for truckers to be \nable to drive their vehicles across the United States virtually \nunimpeded. We do not want a situation where some States have the \nresources to build nice new highways and other States, just because \nthere aren't any people there, do not have the resources to build \nhighways, so it would be an uneven system.\n\n  Clearly, not everybody is unhappy. We have done the best we can to \nmake this as balanced as it could possibly be. I think the vote \nyesterday, while it is not a direct vote, is an indirect indication \nthat most Senators are pretty satisfied. When 76 Senators vote to waive \nthe point of order that was made yesterday, that is a vote in favor of \nthe highway bill. I think that is a pretty good indication this is a \nfair and balanced bill.\n  Different States have different State gasoline taxes to help pay for \nthe highways in their States, matching along with the Federal \ncontributions. We in the State of Montana pay a lot also per capita in \nour contributions to State and Federal highway trust funds, a lot more \nthan most other States. In our State of Montana we spend about $360 per \nperson per year in contributions to the highways. The national average \nis about $250 per person per year. We in Montana spend $360 per person \nper year. I point out that the folks in Arizona are actually below the \naverage. The contributions the people in Arizona pay to the highway \ntrust fund, both to the State and Federal highway trust funds, is about \n$235 per Arizonan per year. That is below the national average.\n  That is fine. That is a decision in large part the people in Arizona \nare making because of their State gasoline taxes. But it is also a \nconsequence of a lot of other factors in the formula for the States. \nThe long and short of it is Arizonans pay less than the national \naverage per capita in their contributions to Federal and State highway \nfunds, whereas folks in other States pay much more. Montanans, as I \nmentioned, pay $360. South Dakotans pay a lot more for highways, more \nthan the national average. People in South Dakota pay about $312 per \nperson. It is interesting--New Yorkers actually are very low. New \nYorkers pay only about $152 per person in their contributions to the \nhighways in the State of New York. That is half what it is in some \nother States.\n  Everybody can bring out figures and statistics. But I do think, for \nthe sake of equity and fairness, it makes sense to get a good bit of \nthese statistics out in the open, on the record, so we all understand \nand realize it is not a perfect bill, but it is a bill that by and \nlarge accomplishes what it is intended to accomplish--that is provide \nthe resources so we can build and maintain our highways, our mass \ntransit, and some of the other programs affiliated with the highway \nprogram.\n  I thank the chairman, who is doing a great job managing this bill. I \nalso very much thank Senator Jeffords, the ranking member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, for excellent leadership. Also \nI give special thanks to my colleague on the Finance Committee, Senator \nGrassley. He and I have worked closely together to provide the revenue \nfor this bill and it is basically through gasoline taxes and other \nexcise taxes.\n  I remind my colleagues this legislation before us does not add to the \nFederal deficit, not at all. In fact, it reduces the Federal deficit. \nIt reduces the Federal deficits; that is, our national debt, by about \n$14 billion over 10 years. We reduce the national debt--not by a lot, \nbut we reduce it. We do not add to the debt. We reduce the debt by \nabout $14 billion over 10 years.\n  Those who are concerned that this is a spending bill, that this bill \nadds to the national debt and deficit, that is not accurate. As a \nreminder, this bill does not add at all to Federal deficit, not one \ndime. It is all paid for.\n  I know a lot of proposals a lot of Senators have, either to lower \ntaxes or spend money on something, are not paid for. This big highway \nprogram is all paid for. It is jobs for America. It is infrastructure \nfor America so we Americans can live the life we want to lead, have the \nhighways we want to have, and compete in the modern world and off in \nthe future with a good highway system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirteen minutes. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my thanks to the chairman and also to my \ncolleague on the Transportation Infrastructure Subcommittee, the \nSenator from Montana. As I say, it helps to have a cousin in the \nbusiness. It helps to have a ranking member who is also ranking on \nFinance with Senator Grassley. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley have \ndone a great job. It is a pleasure to work with him, with Senator \nGrassley, Senator Jeffords and, of course, our chairman, Senator \nInhofe.\n  I hope everybody has been having as enjoyable a time as those of us \nwho have been trying to lead this bill from the various committees--\nEPW, Commerce, Finance. I know this is a very pleasurable experience. \nBut the time has come for it to end. It is time for us to invoke \ncloture. That is why we are asking our colleagues to put an end to \nthis. All good things have to come to a close. If we are to get this \nbill done, we need to invoke cloture and give it a timeframe. We have \nalready limited the number of amendments.\n  The simple fact is we have to get this bill to conference. We have to \ngo to work with the House to come up with a very important surface \ntransportation bill, known as SAFETEA, this year. The extension expires \nin May. We are operating on our sixth extension. The original bill, the \nlast bill, ran out on September 30, 2003. We have had extensions. We \nhave missed the deadline. We absolutely have to get this bill passed.\n  If the extension expires and we do not do anything, not only does the \nU.S. Department of Transportation shut down but States would not be \nable to issue new contracts for summer construction programs on Federal \naid highways. We would have a significant economic blow to our country \nas well as a delay in the building of our necessary roads.\n  Cloture will enable us to get to conference. It is going to be a very \ndifferent conference. The House has a measure that is essentially \nproject oriented. As has been stated by my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle here, we have attempted to achieve equity by a very complex \nformula. The Senator from Montana made a very important point. When we \ncame to the floor, we added $11 billion. Why did we do this? The \nadministration's own Department of Transportation puts out annually a \nconditions and performance report. Even with the $11 billion we added \nto the base number of $284 billion, according to the administration's \nown report, it still is not enough money even to maintain our current \nsystem. That is why money was added. That is why the Finance Committee \nwas given the authority under the Talent-Stabenow amendment to add \nmoney. That is why we waived the point of order--because this money is \nimportant.\n  We heard my good friend, the Senator from Arizona, complaining about \nadding money, implying it was adding to the deficit. You have already \nheard that is pure nonsense. There is, as a matter of fact, a positive \nimpact because the Finance Committee has not only added money to the \nhighway trust\n\n[[Page S5018]]\n\nfund, but to make sure there was no shortfall in the general revenue \nsections, they added more general revenue. There is more general \nrevenue coming in than before as a result of this amendment we adopted, \nand there is more money in the highway trust fund.\n\n  Regarding the point made by the Senator from Arizona, if the \nsituation were not so serious, it would be funny. There is nothing like \na good joke like having a Senator complaining he is not getting enough \nmoney and complaining we added money when adding that money brings the \nState of Arizona increase from last year's bill to 40.6 percent. They \ndo fantastically well. They are one of the top three winners in the \nwhole bill--top four, and he is complaining we added money.\n  You know the old story about the boy who kills his parents and when \ncharged with murder he throws himself on the mercy of the court because \nhe is an orphan. You can either complain about not getting enough money \nor you can complain about having more money added to the bill; you \ncannot do both at the same time. You have to pick one side of the fence \nor the other.\n  This bill does have very important aspects. First and foremost, the \neconomic impact--47,500 jobs are created for every $1 billion spent. \nThat is immediate economic impact. The longer term economic impact of a \ngood transportation bill, as I have pointed out on the floor before--as \na former Governor of my State, I know if you want to know where \neconomic growth is going to occur, where jobs are going to grow, you \ntake a look at the transportation system. You have to have good \ntransportation to create good jobs and to have a strong economy.\n  There are also aspects of this bill, of course, that improve our \nenvironment, because we are reducing congestion. We are putting \nenvironmental planning at the start of the planning process so we can \ntake care of environmental concerns sooner.\n  But the real name of this bill is the SAFETEA bill, and safety is \nprobably the most important part of this bill as far as my State is \nconcerned. I have told this body several times of the number of friends \nI have lost on highways in Missouri. You can travel many national \nhighways, Federal aid highways in Missouri, that are two-lane roads \nwith traffic that merits having four lanes. Do you know what happens \nwhen you have a slow-moving livestock truck or piece of equipment, \nconstruction equipment or farm equipment, on a narrow two-lane road? \nTraffic backs up and backs up and somebody--very often a stranger to \nthe area--tries to pull out and pass, with tragic results. We see white \ncrosses marking our highways where people have lost their lives. \nUnfortunately, the number of those white crosses grows.\n  The Senator from Arizona has complained about the criteria used in \nthe formula for money going to States that have greater than 1 fatality \nper 100 million vehicle miles traveled. That is Missouri and it is 17 \nother States. Actually it is Arizona as well.\n  If this is a SAFETEA bill, shouldn't you consider safety? I certainly \nthink so. Some of the border State people say we need more money \nbecause we are on the borders. I will have a chart this afternoon that \nshows an interesting point of information. Some of the heaviest \ntraffic--some of the heaviest tie-ups, the bottlenecks--is in the \nmiddle of America where East and West, North and South, Southwest and \nNortheast traffic all come together. When you look at the traffic in \ntrucks on our highways on a U.S. Department of Transportation map, \nthere is a great big artery clog right in the heart of America, in \nMissouri, in Oklahoma, in Illinois. That is where the traffic is the \nheaviest. We need a crossroads factor in the formula.\n  It is not the border States alone that have needs. We in the middle \nof Nation need that formula. Missouri has the fifth worst roads in the \nNation; 65 percent of its roads are in fair to poor condition, \nrequiring immediate repair. Missouri also ranks fourth from the bottom \nin number of structurally deficient and functionally obsolete bridges.\n  I say that humbly, knowing that my colleague's--the chairman of the \ncommittee--home State of Oklahoma ranks below Missouri.\n  Yet for all the complaining about how well our States do, we grow at \nthe average rate of 30.40 percent. We grow in that neighborhood. Yet we \nare at the bottom of the list of worst roads and worst bridges in \ndangerous condition.\n  That is why this bill is so important. I urge my colleagues to invoke \ncloture, and I reserve the remaining time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nMinnesota desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I salute the chairman and the ranking \nmember for this excellent legislation. I will support a cloture motion.\n  It is very important we pass this legislation as expeditiously as \npossible for States such as Minnesota which have a short highway \nconstruction season.\n  I wish we had been able to put into place the Senate version a year \nago. I salute Chairman Inhofe for his tireless efforts, working with \nhis associates in the House and also the administration, in an effort \nto pass what would have been an excellent Senate bill a year ago.\n  This bill is as good as it could be, given some of the pressures. It \nis a mystery to me, knowing the serious state of disrepair of our \nhighways in Minnesota and the lack of funding at the State and \nparticularly the local level--it is hard to imagine how any other State \ncould be so far advanced beyond Minnesota's highway construction \nsituation that the money the Senate wanted a year ago, that would be \nproviding for needs this year if not for certain pressures--and is \nbeyond the realm of common sense not to have passed this. So be it.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for, as I understand it, \naccepting an amendment I offered, along with Senator Lugar, also \ncosponsored by my colleague from Minnesota, Senator Coleman, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Grassley, Senator Durbin, Senator Brownback, and \nSenator Bingaman. It is a simple amendment that calls for cars produced \nstarting the model year of 2007 to have a sticker in two different \nlocations indicating the presence of a flexible fuel engine that allows \na car or other gasoline-consuming vehicle to use regular gasoline or up \nto 85-percent ethanol, which in Minnesota is called E-85 which is 85-\npercent ethanol, 15-percent regular unleaded and is used as a \nsubstitute for regular unleaded gasoline in vehicles that have these \nflexible fuel engines.\n  I have two cars, factory-produced Ford Explorers--one in Washington, \nDC, where unfortunately I cannot find the fuel, and one in Minnesota, \nwhere I can--which are as efficient as my previous vehicles using \nregular gasoline, and presently in Minnesota between 30 and 40 cents a \ngallon cheaper than regular unleaded.\n  Consumers will use this fuel as a lower cost alternative if they have \ncars or vehicles that can use it, which is why I have another amendment \nto offer to the Energy bill that requires vehicles produced starting \nmodel year 2007 or thereafter to all carry a flexible fuel engine so \nconsumers have this lower cost option. At least those who buy these \nvehicles will be aware they have a flexible fuel engine and can take \nadvantage of this much lower cost fuel.\n  This amendment is supported by the National Ethanol Vehicle \nAssociation, by the National Corn Growers Association, by the Governors \nEthanol Coalition which Governor Pawlenty from Minnesota chairs, the \nRenewable Fuels Association, National Farmers Union. The automakers are \nneutral to it.\n  I thank the Chair and ranking member for accepting it and hope it \nwill be enacted soon.\n  I ask unanimous consent Senator Brownback be added as a cosponsor to \nthe Lugar Dayton amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\n Amendments Nos. 574, 598, 624 as Modified, 628, 634 as Modified, 643, \n670 as Modified, 681 as Modified, 621, 622, 666 as Modified, 685, 694, \n  705 as Modified, 708 as Modified, 713 as Modified, 737, 725, 726 as \n                 Modified, and 755 to Amendment No. 725\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

TRANSPORTATION NEEDS, GRAYLING, MICHIGAN.\n\n       Item number 820 in the table contained in section 1602 of \n     the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (112 Stat. \n     287) is amended by striking ``Conduct'' and all that follows \n     through ``interchange'' and inserting ``Conduct a \n     transportation needs study and make improvements to I-75 \n     interchanges in the Grayling area''.\n\n\n                     Amendment no. 670, as modified\n\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, we have all heard from folks back home \nabout the high price of gasoline. When you pull into a gas station to \nfill up your tank, you're now paying some of the highest prices of all \ntime.\n  This amendment is designed to do something about that--by promoting a \nchoice at the pump that will allow consumers to choose a fuel that \ntoday is 50 cents per gallon cheaper than regular gasoline.\n  That's why I would like to thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, and the ranking member of the Committee, \nSenator Baucus, for their advocacy of this amendment. I also want to \nthank the manager of the transportation bill, Chairman Inhofe, for \nworking with us on this proposal. These Senate leaders are all \ncommitted to addressing high gas prices, and their work on this \namendment is an example of that commitment.\n  I would like to thank my fellow authors of this amendment, Senator \nTalent, as well as my distinguished colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, for their hard work in getting this provision passed. And I \nthank the cosponsors of this amendment, also longtime supporters of \nethanol, Senators Lugar,\n\n[[Page S5026]]\n\nHarkin, Bayh, Coleman, Salazar, Dayton, and Nelson of Nebraska.\n  And of course, I would like to thank the excellent staff work of \nElizabeth Paris, Matt Jones, and Russ Sullivan on behalf of this \nprovision.\n  I am sure many of us in this Chamber, and many watching these \nproceedings, would jump at the chance to fill our cars and trucks with \nfuel that is 50 cents cheaper than current prices. What many consumers \nmay not know is that that option is available today. It is known as E-\n85, a fuel comprised of 85 percent ethanol. And I suspect most \nAmericans would agree that a fuel made of 85 percent Midwestern corn is \na lot more desirable than one made from 100 percent Middle Eastern oil.\n  Right now, there are millions of cars and trucks that can run on E-\n85. They are known as ``flexible fuel vehicles,'' and the auto industry \nis turning out hundreds of thousands of them every year. These cars and \ntrucks aren't more expensive to operate than regular cars--in fact, for \njust a one-hundred-dollar adjustment, even regular cars could run on E-\n85. And if E-85 is good enough for the Indianapolis 500--which just \nannounced their cars will run on this fuel--then you can be sure that \nE-85 will work great in a flexible fuel vehicle.\n  The only problem now is our short supply of E-85 fuel stations. While \nthere are more than 180,000 gas stations all over America, only about \n400 offer E-85.\n  The amendment adopted by the Senate today addresses this problem by \nproviding a tax credit to encourage the installation of more E-85 fuel \npumps at your local gas station. Its enactment will not only give \nmotorists another option at the pump, it will also send a clear message \nthat the U.S. Senate is serious about reducing our country's dangerous \ndependence on imported oil.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues who have worked to adopt this amendment \nto help make America energy independent.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent the two live quorums be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. All time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     substitute to Calendar No. 69, H.R. 3, a bill to authorize \n     funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and \n     transit programs, and for other purposes.\n         Bill Frist, J.M. Inhofe, David Vitter, Thad Cochran, Norm \n           Coleman, Jim DeMint, Richard Shelby, Orrin Hatch, Kit \n           Bond, Chuck Grassley, Pete Domenici, Jim Talent, \n           Richard G. Lugar, John Thane, Bob Bennett, George \n           Allen, Mitch McConnell.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mandatory quorum call has been waived. The \nquestion is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nsubstitute amendment No. 605 shall be brought to a close? The yeas and \nnays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to respond to the distinguished \nChairman of the Budget Committee. Yesterday afternoon, my colleague \nresponded to my defense of the merits of the Finance Committee title in \nChairman Inhofe's substitute.\n  Since Chairman Gregg's response came shortly before the session ended \nlast night, I am responding this morning.\n  I respect Chairman Gregg's efforts in his initial year as chairman of \nthe Budget Committee. I congratulate him now as I have in the past on \nhis victory in achieving a budget resolution. I was proud to support \nhim in committee, on the floor, and in conference on the resolution.\n  As a senior member of the Budget Committee, I take its role \nseriously. I respect the Budget Act and the importance of the tools of \nfiscal discipline that points of order and other enforcement devices \nbring to the legislative process. I also respect the key role of the \nBudget Committee chairman and his staff under the Budget Act.\n  A careful and fair review of my statement will show that it is \nconsistent with these long-held views. My statement did not claim that \nthere was no valid Budget Act point of order against the Finance title \nof the Inhofe substitute. My statement did not question the authority \nof the Budget Committee chairman in raising the point order.\n  My statement responded to several very specific assertions against \nthe Finance Committee title. One assertion, made quite passionately by \nChairman Gregg, was that the Finance Committee amendment was a product \nof accounting gimmicks. Another assertion was that the amendment was \nnot offset. I responded to the two main assertions ad relied on the \nCongress' official tax policy scorekeepter, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation. Chairman Gregg is right that, under the Budget Act, it is the \nChairman Budget Committee chairman that the Senate parliamentarian \nlooks to determine whether a point of order is well-founded. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, however, determines the scoring of revenue \nmeasures.\n  I will not go into the other points of disagreement in our statements \nbecause the statements speak for themselves.\n  In sum and substance, my statement defended the Finance Committee \ntitle on its scoring by the Joint Committee. My statement did not \ndispute that the amendment spending level was above those contemplated \nby the Budget Resolution or the spending level agreed to by the \nadministration and congressional Republican leadership. Of course, \nFinance Committee jurisdiction extends only to the cash flow of the \nHighway Trust Fund. The Finance Committee title added additional cash \ninflow, trust fund receipts, and additional cash outflow, trust fund \noutlays. The Finance Committee title balances additional trust fund \nreceipts and outlays. That was the job we were asked to do and we did \nit in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senator was necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Santorum).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 92, nays 7, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 122 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--92\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Chambliss\n     Clinton\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Dayton\n     DeMint\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--7\n\n     Cornyn\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     Sununu\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Santorum\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 92, the nays are 7. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank those who voted the right way to \ncome to a conclusion on this bill. This is likely the most important \nbill we will deal with this entire year. Right now we have a \ndistressingly large number of\n\n[[Page S5027]]\n\namendments out there that are germane that people could come and offer. \nWe are not going to have enough time to do it. As is usually the case, \nthere are many out there who are not serious about their amendments. It \nis currently being hotlined to try to find out who is serious and who \nis not. I am going to be talking to individuals, but I would say, if \nyou are serious about your amendment, and you want it considered, bring \nit to the floor. I am sure I speak on behalf of Senator Jeffords as \nwell. We want these amendments brought to the floor, and we also want \nto know how many are out there that may not be serious amendments.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator. Please, \neveryone, expedite.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have an amendment. I would like to offer it at a time \nwhen it would be mutually agreeable to the managers.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest that it is mutually agreeable to send it to the \ndesk and that it be considered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. I will get my amendment, if the two managers \nwill consent that I be recognized to offer it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will very shortly. In the meantime, might \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will shortly call up an amendment. Before \ndoing so, I would like to recall a statement by the late Reverend Peter \nMarshall, possibly, even probably, the most famous and well known of \nthe Senate chaplains, who offered this prayer at the opening of the \nsecond session of the 80th Congress:\n\n       Let us not be content to wait and see what will happen, but \n     give us the determination to make the right things happen.\n\n  Sometimes we can do that, sometimes we can't, but at least we can \ntry. For too many months now, the Congress and the administration have \ntaken a ``wait and see'' approach when it comes to today's life-\naltering price of gasoline.\n  The administration has pinned its rhetoric to an energy plan, waiting \nand hoping to tout a reduced dependence on foreign oil, while conceding \nthat no energy plan will provide immediate relief to high prices at the \npump.\n  The American people have waited and have waited and have waited for \nthe United States to get tough on OPEC and other nations responsible \nfor the recent spike in gasoline prices. Their elected leaders offer \nexplanations and more explanations and still more explanations and \nequivocations about why such action has not reduced prices at the pump.\n  The American people are out there listening and they are watching; \nthey see what is going on here on the Senate floor. They watch us \nthrough those electronic lenses behind the Chair, the Presiding \nOfficer. The American people waited anxiously for the President's \nprime-time news conference, hoping to see at last that somebody would \nproffer some kind of relief from high gas prices. My, how they do hurt. \nHow they do pinch, don't they? Yes. Ultimately, the American people \nwere disappointed as their pleas for relief were again rebuffed. The \npeople have waited, they have waited, they have waited, and they are \nstill waiting. They waited while gas prices have gone up and up and up. \nThe patience of the American people is running out. When will it end?\n  The American people watched incredulously as the House of \nRepresentatives passed an energy bill last month, including $8 billion \nof energy tax cuts. These are tax cuts for many of the corporate \nconglomerates who are enjoying record-breaking profits from today's oil \nprices. Yet the Congress declines--it declines, it declines, and it \ndeclines again and again--to provide relief to the workers who must \nbear the brunt of these price spikes at the pump. I am talking about \nthe working people of America, people whose hands are soiled with \nhonest toil, the working people in America. They are in South Carolina, \nNorth Carolina, and West Virginia.\n  While the big oil companies are making big money, hand over fist, \nfrom high gas prices, the only relief the Congress has seen fit to \nprovide is to the very oil companies--not the people--making all the \nmoney. They are making all the money.\n  The irony is incredible, but not only is it incredible, it is \ncontemptible. It is the little guy who is getting the shaft because we \nrefuse to stand up for him or her. Well, the time has come to take a \nstand. This Congress continues to ignore the working man and the single \nmother. There are lots of them out there and they have to go through \nthis every day when they drive up to the pumps. Think of them. Who is \nhere to take a stand for them--the little guys? There are lots of them \nout there. The little guy is getting the shaft because we refuse to \nstand up for him. Again, this Congress continues to ignore the working \nman and the single mother. This administration continues to ignore the \nworking man and the single mother, and it continues to ignore the \noutdoorsman who can no longer afford to fill up his pickup truck or SUV \nfor a weekend of work--yes, they even work on the Sabbath; they have to \nsometimes--or for a weekend of hunting and fishing.\n  If the Congress cannot wave a magic wand to lower prices at the \npump--and it cannot--at least we can provide short-term relief to \ncompensate workers, and that relief ought not be delayed. We have those \nworkers in Texas, we have them in Oklahoma, and we have them in West \nVirginia. I talk with them every day. The time has come; the clock is \nmoving. Relief ought not be delayed. The time has come for the Congress \nto take action. We must take action. We have heard that television \nstatement: Do it now, do it here.\n  I addressed the Senate last month about this issue, highlighting the \nimpact that high gas prices have had on rural States such as mine, \nrural States such as New Hampshire. Yes, there are rural areas all over \nthis country.\n  When gas prices soar, the impact on rural families can be devastating \nand can be cruel. In my State of West Virginia, the impact has been \nbrutal. It saps the economic strength of the State. It squeezes anybody \nwho owns a vehicle, and it chips away at the income of workers who must \ncommute. They have to commute, there is no way around it. Think of \nthose mountains, those stately, majestic mountains in New Hampshire, \nWest Virginia, and Tennessee. It chips away at the income of workers \nwho have to commute to and from and across and in between those \nmountains. Households must curtail essentials, and families must do \nwithout other things. They have to get that gasoline, they have to get \nto work, they have to get that bread and butter on the table. \nBusinesses lose customers. Think about that. I was once in a small \nbusiness. I was once a small, small businessman. I know what it is. You \nhave to meet a one or two or three-person payroll. And business \nincludes customers. As the pocketbook strings tighten more and more, \nprofits decrease, operating expenses sore, workers' paychecks suffer \nmore and more.\n  Residents of rural States must drive longer distances to and from \nwork, inflicting burdensome costs on commuters. I am talking about the \nStates of Virginia, Georgia, New Hampshire, as well as West Virginia--\nnot just West Virginia.\n  Rural States have less access to public transportation. What does \nthat mean? That means subways and buses and car pooling are not usually \navailable to rural commuters. I am talking about the States of South \nCarolina; Kansas; Iowa, where the tall corn grows; Oklahoma, as well as \nWest Virginia. Not just West Virginia. Hear me now, it is not just West \nVirginia. In Appalachia--13 States are in Appalachia. West Virginia is \nthe only one wholly in Appalachia.\n  In Appalachia, rural roads, twisting and winding and bending around \nthe hills and mountains, exacerbate the financial pain. I am talking \nabout the States of Tennessee, Kentucky, Mississippi, yes, as well as \nWest Virginia. Not just West Virginia; other States as well.\n  When gas prices spike, rural commuters often have no disposable \nincome to absorb the price flux. What\n\n[[Page S5028]]\n\ndoes this do? It forces painful cuts in essential expenditures. I am \ntalking about the States of Idaho, North Carolina--where I was born--\nOhio, South Dakota, as well as West Virginia. So it is not just West \nVirginia.\n  The people of these States and all across America, all across the \nGreat Plains and the prairies, the mountains, the Ozarks, the Rocky \nMountains, all throughout the land, people in these States are crying \nout for action by Congress. So today I offer an amendment to answer \nthat call. We hear you, we should say. Yes, we hear you. So I have an \namendment that says we hear you.\n  My amendment would provide a temporary $500 tax credit for commuters \nwho travel 250 miles per week to and from work. Isn't that a reasonable \napproach, a temporary $500 tax credit for commuters who travel 250 \nmiles per week, and many of them travel more than that? Oh, yes. But we \nput a limit on it, for commuters who travel 250 miles. If you travel \n240 miles, that is not enough. So we try to be very reasonable.\n  Why shouldn't a man or woman who travels 240 miles a week be helped, \ntoo? We know how difficult it is to move legislatively. I have only \nbeen in this Chamber 47 years, 47 years looking around these walls. \n``Novus ordo seclorum,'' it says on that wall, ``a new order for the \nages.'' And ``in God we trust.'' ``In God we trust.'' I have seen these \nwalls for 47 years. Yes, I came over from the other body where I used \nto say: Thank God for the Senate. I never thought of coming over here \nto change the Senate rules to make us another House of Representatives. \nNo, I said thank God for the Senate.\n  Here we are. My amendment would provide a temporary $500 tax credit \nfor commuters who travel 250 miles per week. What does that amount to \nper day? Mr. President, $50 for a 5-day week; is that what it is? It is \n$50 a day for a 5-day week. The credit would be available in rural, \nlow-income States where public transportation is not readily available. \nGo down to Welch, WV. Travel into the hills and mountains of New \nHampshire. The credit would be available in rural, low-income States \nwhere public transportation is not readily available. The credit would \nbe limited to the tax year 2005, 1 year, and it fits within the \ncongressional budget so as not to worsen projected deficits. That is \nreasonable, isn't it? This is not a complicated proposal. The arguments \nin favor of providing relief to workers is obvious, having been made by \nMembers of Congress and the administration for many months now. So we \nput off action day to day, month to month, year to year, waiting for \nsupposed long-term solutions to take effect while we are recreant, \nwhile we refuse to provide relief for the immediate hardship.\n  Let us not delay any longer. Let us not equivocate about economic \ntheories that clearly are working to the detriment of the American \nworkers. Now is the time, and it may be the only time, to vote to \nprovide relief from high gas prices. Now is the time to vote to \nrecognize the plight of workers at the gas pump.\n  Oh, they say, well, this amendment may not be germane. Oh, this would \nset a precedent. What is wrong with that? How are precedents set? What \nis a precedent, if it isn't something new, if it isn't something that \ngoes against the grain of something that has gone before? That is how \nwe get precedents. I have seen many precedents set in this Senate, so \ndo not come here with that argument. I do not know, the Chair may rule \nthis amendment is not germane. I suppose someone might even ask the \nChair.\n  Now is the time to provide relief, a vote to forgo a policy of wait \nand see. It is time to show determination in making the right things \nhappen.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 635 to Amendment No. 605\n\n       (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     allow a credit for rural commuters)\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 635 and ask that \nthe clerk read the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n  Mr. BYRD. I make that consent request, Mr. President. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 635:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from West Virginia \nfor what he is attempting to do for rural America. That happens to be \nme, rural America. I am certainly in sympathy with this issue. The \nproblem I think is going to be the cost. The cost is somewhere around \n$5 billion. Since this affects the finance title of the bill, I am \nlooking to see if Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley can come by and \nvisit a little bit. If the Senator would like to continue explaining \nhis amendment, or we could try to get hold of the two Senators from the \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will yield to the good judgment of the managers of the \nbill. If you would like to wait until the arrival of those two \nSenators, that is fine for me. May I take this moment to congratulate \nhim and congratulate his comanager sitting by my side, the very \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire. Mr. President, you are doing \nyour duty, I say, speaking in the second person, which I am not \nsupposed to do in the Senate. I hope they will come to the floor and \nmake themselves heard.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I appreciate that and will wait until we \nhave an opportunity to speak to those managing the finance title of the \nbill. That being the case, let me renew our invitation for people to \nbring their amendments to the floor. Right now we have hotlined trying \nto determine who is serious about his or her amendment. We have a lot \nto get done. The sooner anyone who has an amendment gets down here for \nthe consideration of that amendment, it will be very helpful.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield for a correction?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have done what Senators sometimes do. They make a \nmistake. They have done it to me, too, in referring to a Senator's \nState as a wrong State. Sometimes they say I am from the State of \nVirginia. I count that as a great compliment, but I am from the great \nState of West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S5029]]\n\n  In this case, I have mistakenly referred to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont as the Senator from New Hampshire, both great States. I am \ntalking about the Senator from Vermont. I believe I referred to him as \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. OK, the Senator from Vermont. I correct \nthe Record.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will just observe that they have covered \nbridges in both New Hampshire and Vermont.\n  Mr. BYRD. And West Virginia.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, can I have the attention of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, please. The Senator from West Virginia does not \nneed to respond to this, but I just want to make sure. First, I rise \nbecause about 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon, I promised the Senator \nfrom West Virginia that I would get back with him and hopefully have \nSenator Baucus with me to discuss whether we could go along with his \namendment.\n  I got the amendment over to my staff, as I promised I would, about \nthat time, but it was 9:30 this morning before I was able to get the \ntwo staffs together. I never did get together with Senator Baucus so I \ncould come over and visit with the Senator personally about it.\n  We have found a cost argument, not an argument against the Senator's \npoint of view on the substance of his amendment, but it is my \nresponsibility as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee to find \noffset. Now, I do not say this to denigrate the Senator's efforts--the \nSenator does not have to worry about offsets; that is my job--but if I \nwere going to go along with the amendment of the Senator, I would have \nthe responsibility to find an offset.\n  So I apologize, first, for not getting back to the Senator as I \npromised I would last night. But based upon some of the arguments that \nMr. Inhofe gave but more importantly related to the work of my \ncommittee--and I cannot speak for Senator Baucus, but I think there is \nan agreement among our staff, and I do not want to put a figure on it \nwithout having the Joint Tax Committee actually score something, but \nthis is a tremendously expensive amendment, not that it is not \njustified.\n  I would have to come up with a fairly large figure that my staff \ntells me would be close to what we have already raised to bring more \nmoney into the transportation fund so that we can get more money for \nthe Senator's State and my State, and more money even for the transit \nthat is a basis for the Senator's argument because he does not have the \nmass transit--and we do not have the mass transit in Iowa as well, so \nIowans would benefit from the Senator's amendment. But I just cannot \nfind that money, and it would detract from all the money we previously \nhad raised.\n  I do not know what the course of action is, but I would have to take \nthe position of advising people not to vote for the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I respect the very able Senator for the \nposition he has taken. I can understand that position, and I appreciate \nit. I have discussed this with the Senator. I do not have a suggestion \nfor an offset. I commend the Senator and Senator Baucus on what they \nhave jointly done to advance this bill and what they have jointly done \nto increase the amounts of money available. I understand completely the \nSenator's position. I do not blame him for it. He states it correctly, \nbut I will say that the amendment does not worsen projected deficits. \nThe amendment fits within the congressional budget. That is why it is \nnot subject to any budget points of order. Deficit projections within \nthe congressional budget will not worsen if this amendment passes.\n  I do respect the Senator. I know we are both in sympathy with what \nthe people in the mountains, the prairies, the plains, and valleys of \nthis great country have to deal with. I am sorry that the amendment is \nnot germane. I understand that. At least I do not think it is. Perhaps \nthe Senator would like to have a ruling from the Chair. I would hope \nthe Chair would say that the amendment would be germane.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to raise any more issues. \nI have expressed why I cannot support the amendment, and I will reserve \nany other action at the time we vote. I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for being understanding of why I did not get back to him.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I once again want to persuade my Republican \ncolleagues that the so-called nuclear option to break the Senate rules \nregarding judicial nominations is unnecessary and unwise. Earlier this \nweek, I came to the floor of the Senate and offered to enter into a \nunanimous consent agreement that will allow an up-or-down vote on \ncontroversial nominee Thomas Griffith to the DC Court of Appeals.\n  We have confirmed 208 of President Bush's nominations to the Federal \ncourt, but this record near 100 percent is enough, and the Republican \nleaders have brought us to the brink of a nuclear showdown. There will \nbe a lot of nuclear fallout if this happens, which would be bad for the \nSenate and bad for the country.\n  As I said on the Senate floor earlier this week, Democrats understand \nthe meaning of checks and balances and our constitutional role in \nensuring a fair and independent judiciary. We know the difference \nbetween opposing nominees and blocking nominees. We will oppose bad \nnominees, but we will only block unacceptable nominees. Unfortunately, \nmy effort to demonstrate good faith to this point has been rejected.\n  My statement earlier this week was immediately rejected. The \ndistinguished majority leader, my friend, has indicated that the Senate \nwould not be allowed to vote on Griffith unless Senate Democrats agree \nto an up-or-down vote on all judicial nominees. What that means is the \nmajority leader will not compromise unless Democrats agree to give up \nthe last check in Washington against abuse of power: the right for \nextended debate. This is not about seven radical judges. In some \npeople's minds, it is paving the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n  Our position is clear: Let us find common ground and confirm judges. \nTheir position appears to be: Let us threaten to break the rules until \nwe get everything we want.\n  Let us find common ground to confirm judges. That does not mean \neverybody. If we cannot find compromise, as I said 2 days ago, then we \nhave to vote. We will fight to protect the Nation's constitutional \nsystem of checks and balances and depend on Republicans of good will \nwho serve in the Senate who do not want to break the rules to change \nthe rules. That is what the people sent us to do, and we will live up \nto our responsibility to the American people.\n  Today, I want to try to do what my Republican colleagues say they \nwant to do, and that is confirm Federal judges. Today, I am prepared to \nenter into an agreement that would be in respect to two and possibly \nthree nominees to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has had \ntremendous problems for going on 13 years. David McKeague, Robert \nGriffin, and likely Susan Neilson, Sixth Circuit nominees from \nMichigan, have been caught up in a dispute that began when the \nRepublican Senate failed to vote on either of the two eminently \nqualified women President Clinton had nominated to the Michigan seats \non that court: Helene White and Kathleen McCree Lewis.\n  Helene White is a distinguished judge on the Michigan Court of \nAppeals. Her nomination was pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor more than 4 years--I repeat, more than 4 years. Kathleen McCree \nLewis is a highly regarded appellate litigator at a prominent Detroit \nlaw firm. Her nomination was pending for more than a year.\n  Despite their outstanding qualifications, both of these nominees, \nalong\n\n[[Page S5030]]\n\nwith over 60 other Clinton nominees, were buried in the Republican-\ncontrolled Judiciary Committee. They were never given the courtesy of \nconsideration by the Judiciary Committee, not even a hearing, much less \nthe courtesy of an up-or-down vote by the full Senate.\n  It seems as if each day a Republican Senator comes to the floor and \nsays that every judicial nominee is entitled to an up-or-down vote on \nthe Senate floor. I challenge these Senators to explain why Helene \nWhite, Kathleen Lewis, and 67 others were denied up-or-down votes on \nthe Senate floor.\n  I have said that what was done in the last 12 years let us put behind \nus. The 69 Clinton nominees and the 10 Bush nominees, let us put them \nbehind us and go forward. We have a new Congress. We have new leaders, \nat least two new leaders, Senator Durbin and I, and we have a number of \nnew Senators. Let us move forward on a new note.\n  The failure of the Senate to confirm these two outstanding Clinton \nnominees meant that there were vacancies on the Sixth Circuit when \nPresident Bush took office more than 4 years ago. President Bush \nnominated candidates to fill those unjustified vacancies, and as other \njudges have left the court, the President has eventually sent four \nSixth Circuit nominees to the Senate. In light of the shameful \ntreatment of President Clinton's Sixth Circuit nominees, Senators Levin \nand Stabenow objected to the Bush nominees to this court, and three of \nthem were filibustered in the last Congress. They were determined that \nthe GOP tactic of denying hearings and votes to qualified nominees \nshould not succeed.\n  I have talked about these on the Senate floor earlier. These were \nprocedural objections. It had nothing to do with the qualifications of \ntwo of these Sixth Circuit nominees.\n  I supported the two Senators from Michigan. They have been fighting a \ngrave injustice that has been perpetrated on White and Lewis. They have \nbeen fighting for the principle of fair treatment. I and all Democrats \nhave been proud to stand with them in that fight.\n  Now with the Senate facing the threat of a nuclear option, we have to \nremember why we are here. We are here to govern, not endlessly engage \nin political bickering that brings us to the brink of a Republican \nshutdown. The American people face great challenges each and every day: \nescalating health care costs; record high gas prices; skyrocketing \ntuition; as we learned today on the national news, pensions that are \nbeing thrown out the windows of major companies that have tens of \nthousands of employees; mounting debts that will be handed down to our \nchildren and our grandchildren. Under President Bush's leadership, \nmiddle-class Americans have gone backward, not forward. Instead of \nhelping them, we are bickering over seven judges and, in my estimation, \nmany radical judges.\n  For the sake of the American people and the dignity of the Senate, \nDemocrats have been and will be reasonable. We believe too much is at \nstake. Our very system of constitutional checks and balances is at \nstake in this dispute. In granting an up-or-down vote on two and likely \nthree of these circuit court judges--and let me say, the nominee I have \ntalked about, Susan Neilson, from everything we know, is a fine woman. \nShe was just grievously ill, and therefore she was not able to have the \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee. We are confident that will take \nplace quickly. Once that is done and the two Senators from Michigan \nhave had a chance to vet her, that will take care of our being able to \nmove forward on three, not just two.\n\n  Henry Saad would have been filibustered anyway. He is one of those \nnominees. All one needs to do is have a Member go upstairs and look at \nhis confidential report from the FBI, and I think we would all agree \nthat there is a problem there.\n  The other two nominees, Griffin and McKeague, would not have been \nfilibustered but for the treatment of the Clinton nominees.\n  Accordingly, I want the majority leader to be aware that Democrats \nare prepared to enter into the following unanimous consent agreement: \nIf the nominations of Griffin, McKeague, and Neilson are reported from \nthe Judiciary Committee, we agree to limit floor debate on all three \nnominations to a total of 6 hours equally divided. Following the use or \nyielding back of that time, there would be a vote on each of these \nthree nominations. Once again, I say to my Republican colleagues, do \nthey want to confirm judges or do they just want to provoke a fight?\n  We have confirmed all but four of the judicial nominees the majority \nleader has brought to the Senate floor this year. We are prepared to \nvote on the nomination of Griffith to the DC Circuit. We are prepared \nto vote on two and likely three of the nominees to the Sixth Circuit. \nWhy are we being denied the opportunity to confirm these judges? We \nhave already confirmed 208 of President Bush's judicial nominations. If \nthe majority leader will accept our offer to vote on Griffith and these \nSixth Circuit nominees, we would have confirmed 212 of President Bush's \nnominees and rejected only 5. Is the majority leader prepared to break \nthe rules and violate 217 years of Senate tradition, all for five \nextreme judges? I hope not.\n  I have great admiration and respect for my Republican counterpart, \nand I am hopeful and confident that somehow we can work our way through \nthis morass.\n  In a New York Times op-ed 2 days ago, former Senator George Mitchell, \nwho was the majority leader in this body, quoted from a famous speech \ndelivered by one of his predecessors, former Senator Margaret Chase \nSmith, whom I did not have the opportunity to meet, but I wish I could \nhave. In her famous ``Declaration of Conscience'' speech against the \nterrible McCarthyism then practiced by members of her own party, she \nsaid:\n\n       I don't believe the American people will uphold any \n     political party that puts political exploitation above \n     national interest. Surely we Republicans aren't that \n     desperate for victory. While it might be a fleeting victory \n     for the Republican Party, it would be a more lasting defeat \n     for the American people. Surely it would ultimately be \n     suicide for the Republican Party and the two-party system \n     that has protected our American liberties from the \n     dictatorship of a one-party system.\n\n  Today, the Senate is not plagued by McCarthyism but by what some \nbelieve is an abuse of power.\n  Lord Acton, whom we studied in college--I thought it was just \nsomething the teacher had me think about that had no practical \napplication to my life's work, but it has. Lord Acton: ``Power tends to \ncorrupt.'' Lord Acton: ``Absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely.''\n  We have now a legislative body that is controlled by the Republicans \nin the Senate by a significant majority, by a significant majority in \nthe House of Representatives, seven of the Supreme Court Justices \nacross the street are Republican appointees, the White House is \nRepublican. Let's not have Lord Acton's theory come to be.\n  Today, the Senate is not plagued by McCarthyism but by what some \nbelieve is abuse of power. Still, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, this \ngreat Republican Senator, her words ring true. I hope there are enough \nmodern-day Senator Margaret Chase Smiths who will be guided by the \ninterests of the Nation, not partisan politics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be brief. I was just talking to my \nstaff and to the Democratic leader to see exactly what offer was made. \nI did not know exactly what offer had been made, but he reviewed it \nwith me.\n  Let me make a statement because it is important for people to know \nthe Democratic leader and I are in constant conversation about what is \na very important issue to this institution, to the culture of this \ninstitution, to the past and traditions which are important, but \nultimately it is what we do in the future because that is what we can \ncontrol today. It is our responsibility to do so.\n  As we walk the Halls, people come up all the time and say there are \noutside groups putting pressure on people to behave in certain ways, or \nto vote in certain ways in terms of this important issue. I have told \nthem, all day and each and every day, ultimately how we handle judges \nin these judicial nominees is determined, as set out in the \nConstitution, by the 100 Senators who are here today. That is what we \nare working with and discussions are ongoing.\n  Having not heard the specifics of the proposal, the Democratic leader \nand I\n\n[[Page S5031]]\n\nwill continue conversations on the proposal that he has put forth. But \nI do want to draw back and say that the more and more I listen to all \nthe recent discussions about the President's judicial nominees, the \nmore disturbed I become and the more upset I have become. Indeed, as I \nthink about it now, it angers me to think about it, much of it, because \nquite frankly a real injustice, a real injustice is being done to our \nNation's system of justice.\n  The reputation and the records of some of America's finest jurists, \nseven of them we talked about in the last Congress and over the last \nseveral weeks--in fact, for months now in morning business we have \ntalked about how outstanding many of these jurists are--those \nreputations are being sullied and they are being smeared and we have \ntalked among ourselves, not necessarily on the Senate floor but in \nprivate as we do on both sides of the aisle.\n  This has an impact on individuals, on their lives. Yes, their \ncareers, but their lives, their personal lives, their lives with family \nmembers. And it is inexcusable, I believe.\n  It is time, in fact, I think it is long past time, for the majority \nof this Senate to come to their defense and to be able to express that \non the floor of the Senate. I believe it betrays the great heritage of \nthis country to drag a person's good name through the mud using the \nmedia and the coverage of that, and then deny them the right to be \ndefended on the floor of the Senate and voted on on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We look at the individuals. I use the word ``smeared'' because I \nbelieve that is the level that much of the discussion has risen to in \nthis body. It disturbs me. It is time for us to address this, and that \nis why, once we finish the highway bill, we have to work together and \naddress this much larger issue, larger than much of the legislation \nthat is brought to this floor in the course of our daily operations. \nThis betrayal of the country's heritage is not the way we are supposed \nto do things in this body, in the Senate. It is not the way we are \nsupposed to do things in America. It is not the idea of fairness--I am \ngoing to use that word, ``fairness''--that I was accustomed to before \ncoming to this body in the Senate.\n  It is not the level of fairness that you expect in a doctor-patient \nrelationship, and thus America doesn't understand it, why we cannot \nbring somebody to the floor and vote on them--fair vote, up or down. It \nis our responsibility.\n  We hear again and again about minority rights. The Constitution was \nwritten to ensure the rights of the minority. We respect that. Both \nsides of the aisle respect that. It is much of the tradition of this \nbody. But the Constitution was written--I guess it was neither written, \nnor has it operated in 214 years, in a manner that denies the majority \nof people in this body the right to hold a vote, yes or no, confirm or \nreject--confirm or deny--up or down--on a President's most important \nnominations. These are the most important nominations of a President of \nthe United States. These are the nominations to our Nation's highest \njudicial offices.\n\n  Yes, justice must be independent. Yes, justice must be blind. But I \ncannot and I do not think we as a body can turn a blind eye to the \ncontinued attacks on innocent people who are willing to dedicate their \nlives. Let's have that debate on the floor of the Senate, bring them up \nin a regular order, have as much time as it justifies, listen to both \nsides, see if the smears and the accusations are real, and then have a \nvote. And however the vote falls, we are willing to accept that. \nConfirm them or reject them, we will accept the vote. That is the way \nthis body expresses itself.\n  The Democratic leader and I will continue our discussions. Again, it \nis one of the great pleasures to be able to talk back and forth. But I, \nbased on whether it is individual proposals or the larger discussion of \nwhat to do with the seven judicial nominees, or as we look ahead--what \nI propose we do is roughly the following: If Members of the minority \nwant to make their case--I will tell you a lot of times we hear the \ncase of extremist, out of the mainstream--if they want to make their \ncase that the American Bar Association is wrong in the recommendations \nthey have given, or in one instance in California 76 percent of the \nCalifornia voters are wrong, let them do so and we will do them nominee \nby nominee and have the courage to do so on the floor of the Senate, \nwith plenty of time for debate--we can agree on how much time for \ndebate on each one--and then have a vote.\n  America understands having a vote, having heard the case made by both \nsides. America does not understand how we cannot, how we can deny them \nthat vote.\n  For our part, you will hear us defend the President's nominees. We \nwill rebut and refute the attacks. Sometimes we believe, and I think \nAmerica believes when they hear them, they are scurrilous attacks. We \nwill do it point by point. Then, after we do that, we will have that \nvote. All 100 people in here will be able to vote yes or no, and then \nwe will move to the next nominee in an orderly, systematic way, the \nones who are on this Executive Calendar who have been considered by the \nJudiciary Committee, and then we will start bringing them out. I am \nconfident, if we do that--I am very confident we will be able to judge \nthose nominees on their merits--not because they are the President's \nnominees; not because people voted a certain way, even in the last \nCongress when things were very partisan, when a lot of it was in the \nheat of those elections, but in an environment of renewed civility, of \nbeing able to work together the way the Democratic leader and I are in \nour conversations every day--every day we sit down and discuss how to \naddress this problem. I think that is the same civility colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle feel deep inside.\n  They do not want things to come to a head. We all know the \npartisanship, as the other distinguished Senator from Nevada said, Mr. \nEnzi described it--well, the partisanship started and other people 3 \nyears ago didn't even think about filibusters. I don't think they \nthought about filibustering Supreme Court nominees or circuit court \nnominees. It didn't enter their head. Things have gotten so difficult \nand so challenging and so partisan and so locked down that it has been \nelevated up to where, on a routine basis--a routine basis, one out of \nthree to one out of four of the circuit court nominees that came from \nthe President were filibustered, were blocked, were denied an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  I think everybody agrees that was excessive. I will not go into the \npast because I think we need to project to the future, but now is the \ntime to get through that and to get over that. I think anything less \nthan that at this point of allowing people to come to the floor, debate \nthem fully, and have them voted on--and I think the American people \nwill recognize--is a sham. I am not saying we should not come to an \nagreement of exactly how we should do it, but the American people \nunderstand at this juncture--they may not understand the filibuster, or \nrules of the Senate, and many have not gone back and read the \nConstitution, but what they do understand is full debate and a vote for \npeople who have been nominated by the President of the United States to \nthe highest courts in this country is fair and it is the right thing to \ndo. Anything less than that is a sham. It involves hypocrisy. Hypocrisy \nmust, in this Senate, come to an end.\n\n  If it comes to an end--on both sides in terms of the hypocrisy--if it \ncomes to an end, we have a great year and a half to address \nimmigration, to address energy, to address the health care issues that \nmean so much to me with 40 million people uninsured out there; we have \nbeen able to do class action, bankruptcy and the fifth fastest budget \non time and the supplemental supporting our troops overseas and we are \nworking on asbestos in committee and we are making great progress. It \nis time to move beyond this.\n  The hypocrisy must and will end. Each nominee is entitled to and must \nreceive a full and just consideration of his or her candidacy and then \na fair up-or-down vote.\n  Again, I was not in the Senate, and I did not realize the Democrat \nleader would make the specific offer. We have talked about much of what \nhe said. I came over as soon as he began to talk, and I appreciate his \noffer for Senate debate and votes on some of the President's judicial \nnominees, but say once again that it is that principle of an up-or-down \nvote that is going to govern this side of the aisle. I believe it is \nwhat the American people expect.\n\n[[Page S5032]]\n\n  With that, I am happy to turn back to the Democratic leader. Again, I \nlook forward to our further discussions on addressing the issue that \nboth he and I understand have to be addressed right now so we can move \nforward and address the many other issues. Doing that in a mutually \nacceptable way earns the respect of the American people and this great \ninstitution we serve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I, frankly, wish I could spend more time on the most \nimportant highway bill. I was chairman of the full committee on two \nseparate occasions, and I am interested in the jurisdiction of the \nhighway bill. I am sorry my attention is diverted from all we are doing \non judges.\n  Let me say this to my distinguished counterpart, the Republican \nleader, the senior Senator from the State of Tennessee, I have said in \nthe Senate on a number of occasions, I cannot justify what went on \nduring the 8 years Clinton was President. I am not here to go into a \ndissertation of what happened the last 4 years during the Bush years.\n  But I say this: We never got into any problem with filibusters during \nthe Clinton years because these people never got any kind of attention. \nThey were buried in the committee. I hope the American public \nunderstand that 69 people were nominated by a President of the United \nStates, nominations came to the Hill and were lost. Some of them waited \nyears and years, almost 5 years. We are not here to debate every 1 of \nthe 10. We have narrowed it down to a fairly small number.\n  We have to go forward. I don't know if the distinguished Republican \nleader and I can come up with a formula that satisfies our two \ncaucuses. We realize the time is of the essence. Not only has the \ncountry had enough of the judicial problem we call the nuclear option, \nbut the Senator from Tennessee and the Senator from Nevada have had \nenough. We have to move on. We have work we have to do in this Senate. \nThe Republican leader has mentioned the things we have been able to \naccomplish so far. It hasn't been easy what we have been able to do but \nwe put the record of our accomplishments this quarter about as far as \none could go in saying we have done a pretty good job.\n  We have a lot of other things to do. He has mentioned a few things. \nBut whether or not we can get things done in this Senate means we have \nto move beyond this problem.\n  Some have said that the Senate will stop. The Senate is not going to \nstop. It is a body that has lots and lots of rules and procedures and \nthings are going to slow down. It will make it very hard to get things \ndone.\n  We are now approaching June. After we finish 2 more weeks of work, we \nhave 7 weeks remaining until the August recess--7 weeks to do all the \nthings we need to do. Then we come back, and it is time to finish our \nappropriations bills. We have so, so much to do.\n  This is not to make me look good or the Senator from Tennessee look \ngood. We have the people's business to do. We are chosen, as indicated \nby the vision of our Founding Fathers, to represent States. The State \nof Nevada has about 2.5 million people. The State of New York has 19 \nmillion. The State of California has 35 million. In the little State of \nNevada, I have as much power as Senators from heavily populated states.\n  I hope that Senator Frist and Senator Reid can work a way out of \nthis. I don't know if we can. We have met on this. Our conversations, I \nam sorry to say, are completely filled with discussion of this. We have \ntalked about every possible avenue we think is a way to get my caucus \nand his caucus out of this.\n  I have come to one conclusion: If we work out a deal, there are not \ngoing to be many happy people around here. We will have to work \nsomething out that is a good compromise. As I have said in the Senate \nbefore, what does that mean? Both sides are unhappy.\n  I hope we do not have to come here and I have to look to six \nRepublicans to stop a change of the Senate as we have known it. I hope \nwe do not get to that point.\n  I have said, with the majority leader off the floor and I say it when \nhe is in the Senate right here, I have the greatest respect and \nadmiration for this man.\n  I have said it in my private conversations with others, I have said \nit in the Senate again today. He chose public service for the right \nreason. Senator Frist is an accomplished surgeon, in a specialty, \ntransplant surgeon. He is a man of means. He does not have to come \nhere. He did it because he wanted public service. I have admiration for \nhim. I wish we could move past this and move on with the business at \nhand.\n  I, again, say I cannot justify what went on during the Clinton years. \nIt was bad. As the distinguished Senator mentioned, people's lives were \ndisrupted and changed. They quit jobs and then they had no job. They \nwaited in limbo for years. It affected people's lives. He and I have \ndiscussed how it affected individual human beings to their detriment.\n\n  I know for the people we are talking about, the Republicans--I am \nsorry, the people nominated--I don't know if they are Republicans; I \nassume they are--by President Bush, this has had an adverse effect on \nsome of their lives, not all of them but some of them. So we have to \nmove on. When we move on, we have to have the Senate we have always \nknown.\n  We need the partisanship to continue. There is nothing wrong with \npartisanship. We are the envy of the rest of the world because of our \ntwo-party system. We are not like the parliamentary system in Great \nBritain where they have three parties, and Blair, with his party, \nbarely got a majority. We are not like India or Great Britain.\n  Mr. President, what a wonderful country this is. President Bush was \nelected with fewer votes than the person he beat. His case was decided \nin the Supreme Court of the United States. I did not like the decision \nthey made, but I felt like the rest of Americans--it was all over with. \nThere was not a car burned, no fire started. There were no \ndemonstrations. He became our President the minute that decision was \nmade.\n  But the fact that we are partisans in protecting this great two-party \nsystem we have does not mean we should not work together on issues for \nthis country. We need to do that. I hope we can do that. As the \ndistinguished majority leader said, we are coming down to where the \nrubber hits the road. I would think next week there will be a decision \nmade on this one way or the other. I hope it is something that is good \nfor the American people. I am going to do my level best to work with my \n44 Senators to see that is the case. I know he will work with his 54 \nSenators to see that is the case. And history will determine how the \nSenator from Nevada and the Senator from Tennessee fared on this issue, \nwhether we were able to come through on an issue of tremendous \nimportance, because the microscope is on the Senate of the United \nStates as we speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I know we are on the highway bill. Senator \nByrd is about to speak. So I think at least from my standpoint we will \ncontinue our discussions. As you can see, we both feel passionately \nabout this issue, understanding it is our responsibility as leaders to \nlead on an issue that affects this country in a very dramatic way. It \naffects the future of this institution in a dramatic way.\n  Just to clarify, I believe we both agreed that we are going to all \nkeep working together to address this, but we do need to bring some \nsort of closure to this. Therefore, after the highway bill, at the \nappropriate time, we will spend--it is going to probably take a week, \nor I don't know exactly what it is going to take, but next week--and I \nwould hope we would engage in regular order and that we have people on \nthe Executive Calendar and we can do what we have always done, bring \nthem up. And as to which one, and how we go about it, would be in \ndiscussion.\n  But you can tell from my remarks, I believe what the American people \nexpect is we will have full debate and expect an up-or-down vote on \nthose, go through the normal course of business. People will be able to \njudge. And I hope and pray people will be able to express themselves \nthrough a vote on the floor here in the Senate.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \npermitted\n\n[[Page S5033]]\n\nto address a question to the distinguished minority leader without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask my minority leader, what was his \nproposition that he recommended?\n  Mr. REID. This was only a minor issue. What we have done, I say to my \ndistinguished friend through the Chair, and my former leader, is that \nwe have three judges, one for the DC Court of Appeals and two for \nMichigan, probably three for Michigan, who we said we have no \nobjection--they are all circuit court judges--to move forward on. What \nSenator Frist has said in reply is that he wants to have all the judge \nissues resolved before we move to any of these circuit court judges. \nThat is what he said and that is what I said.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I address a question to the \ndistinguished Republican leader without losing my right to the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. Leader, what is wrong with that? What is wrong with the \nproposition that the minority leader has suggested?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, we will continue the discussion. I would \nprefer to, as leader, take the Executive Calendar and take the people \non the Executive Calendar, who have gone through the Judiciary \nCommittee, who have been debated--it is the way we have always done \nbusiness or should do business--go through committee and have them \nvoted on. If they are voted on, they come to the calendar. At that \npoint in time, you would look at that list, and you would bring them to \nthe floor, and you would have the debate, and you would vote. That is \nwhat I would much prefer.\n  The specifics, just like you asked, I have heard, and we will \nconsider that. But why not take Priscilla Owen for the Fifth Circuit, \nwho is on this calendar, who has waited 4 years, rather than other \njudges, if we are going to be addressing judges? Or Janice Rogers \nBrown, who is a sharecropper's daughter, who is at the Supreme Court of \nCalifornia, with 76 percent approval, who is on the Executive Calendar? \nAll she is waiting for--all she is waiting for--is a vote. Why can't we \naddress Janice Rogers Brown?\n  William Pryor--we had a recess appointment; he has done an \noutstanding job; I was just talking to our distinguished Senators from \nAlabama--was marked out of the Judiciary Committee today.\n  So what I would like to do--again, I am not going to rule out \nanything. And I understand the Michigan judges in this Congress may be \nviewed a little differently than last Congress, and I appreciate that. \nI think once we can discuss how we are going to deal with those on the \nExecutive Calendar--bring them to the floor--that we will be able to \nmove very quickly on all of these, I am hopeful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have listened to this discussion with \nconsiderable dismay. I hope that both leaders will not leave the floor.\n  I cannot understand why we can't proceed a little at a time. If we \nare seeking to--\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, may I respond to my distinguished friend?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. May I retain my right to the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader and I have had, as I \nhave indicated, many conversations. I think we should proceed one by \none. The distinguished majority leader wants to resolve this issue once \nand for all. So I accept him at what he wants to do. I am going to work \nwith him over the next several days--hopefully, it doesn't take that \nlong--to see if we can resolve this in some manner. If not, we both \nagreed that this matter is going to end sometime next week anyway. We \nwould hope that in the meantime we can resolve this. We are on the \nhighway bill. We have a lot of work to do on that. In the interim, I \nwould hope that we can work something out. If we can't, next week we \nwill have a showdown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like to avert a showdown, if we can \ndo it. Why do we have to have a showdown?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd, if I could be rude and interrupt, through the \nChair, without the Senator losing his right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd, I feel this very way, very strongly. I say, \nrespectfully, to a man who is the dean of the Senate today, has been in \nthe Senate almost 50 years, who I have the widest respect for, we are \nnot going to resolve this issue right now. We are trying to do that. We \nare going to have some private conversations. What I am saying to my \ndistinguished leader, give us a little bit of time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, I have no quarrel with giving the \nSenators time. But I hope we will attempt, in every way possible, to \navoid that showdown the distinguished minority leader has referred to.\n  This matter--\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, let me just interrupt. The majority leader \ndid not say anything about a showdown.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, Mr. President, I know of nothing in my 47 years in \nthis body, in my 53 years in this Congress, that has pained me more \nthan this issue. I am pained, pained by the political partisanship. \nWhat this country needs is not partisanship but statesmanship. I have \ngreat faith in the Senate. I have great faith in the two leaders. The \nminority leader has made a suggestion. Why don't we proceed with it?\n  I am sorrowful we have come to the point where we seemingly forget \nthe American people. We talk about the feelings of those nominees who \nhave not been given an up-or-down vote. I am sorry about their \nfeelings. But Senators have a right to speak, have a right to object.\n  And the distinguished Republican leader talks about the need for an \nup-or-down vote, an up-or-down vote, an up-or-down vote. I have heard \nthe President say something about that.\n  Mr. President, here is my guide, the Constitution of the United \nStates. What does it say? Does it say that each nominee shall have an \nup-or-down vote? Does it say that? I ask the Senator from Tennessee, I \nask any Senator to respond to that question. Does this Constitution \naccord to each nominee an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond to the question \nthat has been directed to me.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. FRIST. To the question, does the Constitution say that every \nnominee of the President deserves an up-or-down vote, the answer is, \nno, the language is not there. Up-or-down vote, that is the language we \nuse to signify that when the President of the United States sends a \nnominee to the highest court in the land, which is his or her \nresponsibility, which is in the Constitution, they send it to this body \nfor advice and consent. It is common sense to me, it is fairness to me \nthat when they come over to give advice and consent, we go through the \nJudiciary Committee. If they make it out of the Judiciary Committee, \nthe way we give advice and consent on this floor is a vote. That is \nwhat we are elected to do. Or vote no. I don't mean you have to vote \nyes on them, but advice and consent.\n  To the American people who are listening now, when they elect us \nhere, what is fair, what is our responsibility, what is our duty is to \nvote. That is how we give voice. You can't cut these nominees in half; \nyou can't reshape them; you can't amend them; you can't send them \nto conference--all of those things. That is why I am a tremendous \nadvocate for the filibuster for legislative matters. But when you have \na nominee that comes over, all you can do is shine the light. You \nexamine them. You debate it, unlimited debate--unlimited debate--and \nthen to give advice and consent, which is in that Constitution, the \nadvice and consent is right there. How do you do it? Vote yes, vote no. \nConfirm, reject. We\n\n[[Page S5034]]\n\naccept it. One hundred people have spoken, and then we move on to the \nnext nominee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this says that he, the President, shall have \nthe power to nominate and, by and with the consent of the United States \nSenate, shall appoint. To give consent, we may vote. But to deny \nconsent doesn't require a vote. It does not require a vote and the \nrecord shows that. The record shows that Republicans and Democrats \nhave, from time to time, the leadership has denied a vote to a nominee \nsimply by bottling up that nominee in the committee. That denies the \nnominee a vote. The Senate speaks, as it were, and refuses to give its \nconsent by just saying nothing; thus, keeping those nominees in the \ncommittee. That has been done from time immemorial and more recently in \nincreasing measure.\n  Many nominees under the Clinton administration were not given an up-\nor-down vote. They were sent up here by the President of the United \nStates. They were not given an up-or-down vote. They were kept in \ncommittee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me finish. I will be happy to yield. They were not \ngiven an up-or-down vote. So the Senate did not give its consent. That \nis all right. That is within the Constitution. The Senate did not give \nits consent. So what is the difference, if the Senate, through its \ncommittee system, decides not to give a presidential nominee an up-or-\ndown vote in the committee, then? The Senate may decide not to indicate \nits confirmation by an up-or-down vote, just simply be silent. It has \nnot confirmed, has it? It has not given its consent, has it? So what is \nthe difference?\n  If a nominee is not given confirmation by a committee, what is the \ndifference? You are not giving consent there. If you are not given an \nup-or-down vote on the committee, what is the difference? I am unable \nto understand the difference.\n  Let's do what the Constitution says. Let's do what the Constitution \nsays. When we talk about what these nominees deserve, what do the \nAmerican people deserve? That should matter. What do the American \npeople deserve? They deserve to move on. Look at the problems that \nconfront this country.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator wishes me to yield, I would \nbe glad to. I have the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may yield to the \ndistinguished majority leader for a statement without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, why does Priscilla Owen--through advice and \nconsent, who has gone through Judiciary Committee--not deserve the \nfairness--yes, the fairness--of an up-or-down vote, where every Senator \ncan speak for or against on the floor of the Senate? Why does Priscilla \nOwen not deserve--she has waited 4 years--an up-or-down vote? How can \nyou explain to the American people at this juncture, after what I would \ncall an unprecedented number of filibusters in the last Congress, that \nPriscilla Owen does not deserve a vote? It is our responsibility to \ngive advice and consent. How does she not deserve a vote in the Senate \nnext week or the following week?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what does the Constitution say? By and with \nthe consent, the President shall have the power, and by and with the \nconsent of the United States Senate, shall appoint. Now, we can wrangle \nuntil the crack of doom about why so and so and so and so were not \ngiven an up-or-down vote in the Senate. One could ask that question ad \ninfinitum about those many nominees that were sent to the Senate by \nPresident Clinton. They never got up-or-down votes. I didn't take the \nfloor and urge that they deserved this or that.\n  The Senate should be guided by this Constitution. If it elects not to \nconfirm by simply withholding its voice, it can do so. I commend both \nleaders for their efforts. But I am telling you, the American people \ndeserve something. That is what we should think about. The American \npeople deserve action by the Senate to get on with the business of the \npeople. Look at these high gas prices. We can talk about immigration \npolicy. We can talk about access to health facilities. The American \npeople deserve action on the part of the Senate, and here we are \nwrangling over a half-dozen nominations for judgeships. That is just a \nshirttail full of nominations, and they have been sent to the Senate \nalready. In the first administration, if the Senate saw fit not to give \nits confirmation to them, why should the President send the same \nnominations back up to the Senate? There are plenty of people in this \ncountry who are able--many lawyers and judges who are able. There are \nplenty of people the President could nominate that would not have a \nproblem getting confirmation in the Senate. Why do we have to send the \nsame ones back here? That is up to the President. If he wants to send \nthe same ones, he can.\n  I am saddened by this threat to use the so-called nuclear option. The \ndistinguished majority leader prefers to call it the ``constitutional \noption.''\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a point of order?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet. I have not said much on this question, but I want \nto say a few things today. The Republican leader refers to it as the \n``constitutional option.'' I refer to it as ``constitutional folly.'' \nWe talk about freedom of speech in the Senate. Roots run deep with \nrespect to freedom of speech. When the distinguished Republican leader \nfirst became leader, and even before he became leader, he visited my \noffice and we had a good conversation. I believe he asked my thoughts \non whether he might be a good leader of the Senate. I said give the \nSenate the opportunity to debate and to amend. That is what we are \ntalking about here--the right to amend, the right to debate. Yet they \nare talking about the nuclear option.\n  Don't kill freedom of speech in the Senate. That great compromise \nthat was entered into on July 16, 1787, is why we are here today. If it \nhadn't been for that compromise, the Senator who sits in the chair \nwould not be sitting there. The distinguished Democratic leader would \nnot be the leader in this body. There would be no Senate, and there \nprobably would not be a Republic. The great compromise said there shall \nbe two Houses, and the membership number of one shall be determined on \nthe basis of population; the other will be a forum of the States in \nwhich each State is equal to every other State and each Senator is \nequal to every other Senator.\n  We talk a lot about tradition. I say to my good friend--and he is my \nfriend--the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, I have heard a good \nmany Senators on the floor talking about tradition. Well, tradition in \nthe Senate means freedom of debate going back to the beginning of this \nRepublic; and the Articles of Confederation, the first Constitution of \nthe United States--going back to the Articles of Confederation, back to \nthe House of Commons, the people of England who were in this country, \nespecially those who decided on this Constitution, were British \nsubjects.\n  So the roots of freedom of speech are deep. They go back to 1689, to \nthe time when the English offered to William III, of Orange, and Mary \nthe opportunity to be joint sovereigns. The proposition was that there \nmust be freedom of speech in the Senate. Those two sovereigns--that was \none of the items that was to be agreed to, freedom of speech in the \nHouse of Commons. That was on, I believe, February 13, 1689. On \nDecember 16 of that year, a statute was passed incorporating those \nrights into a statute. That was the Bill of Rights of our English \nforebears. As I say, that common thread of freedom of speech runs deep, \ndeep in the House of Commons, and we ought to honor it here.\n\n  We are talking about cutting off the rights of Senators and about \nwhat the nominees deserve. What do the American people deserve? Well, \nlet's adhere to tradition. There wasn't any limitation on speech until \n1917 in the Senate. First, they had the previous question. Aaron Burr \nsaid in 1805, when he made his departing speech from the Senate--I am \njust hoping I might have the attention of Senators. I have not had much \nto say on this question, although it has kept me awake many nights. I\n\n[[Page S5035]]\n\nhave spent sleepless hours worrying about this thing of killing debate, \nfreedom of speech in the Senate. Who wishes, Mr. Leader, to have that \nkind of a legacy to confront him--to help to kill freedom of speech in \nthe Senate? You don't want that legacy. I don't want to see you have \nthat legacy--freedom of speech in the Senate killed.\n  Aaron Burr urged the Senate to do away with the previous question. \nThey still have the previous question in the House of Representatives \nand in the House of Commons in England. The previous question had been \non the books for a few years, but it hadn't been used, so Aaron Burr, \nin 1805, urged the Senate to do away with the previous question by \nwhich they could shut off debate. In 1806, in that first revision of \nthe Senate rules, it was left out. No more could a Senator move the \nprevious question in this body.\n  That was the end of it until 1917. Then, when President Wilson sought \nto arm merchant ships, there was a filibuster by a few Senators. Thank \nGod. I came over here from the House like a lot of Senators have. Some \nwant to make the Senate another House of Representatives.\n  The Founding Fathers did not want to do that. But when I came to the \nHouse, I did not come over here chewing at the bit to change the Senate \nrules and make this a second House of Representatives, only smaller. I \nsaid thank God for the U.S. Senate many times when I was in that other \nbody. Thank God for the U.S. Senate.\n  Why did I do that? Because over here, a man or woman may stand on his \nor her feet so long as their lungs, their brass lungs, will carry their \nvoice, and they can object.\n  And may I say to the distinguished majority leader, he made mention \nof the late Senator Smith from Maine. I was here when she was here. \nWhat a grand woman that one, a great Senator, Margaret Chase Smith. I \nwish she were here today, Margaret Chase Smith. I wish those Senators \nof that day were here. They would not stand still for a minute to \nthrottling freedom of speech in the U.S. Senate.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, please think \nabout this. Think about this. Don't leave this as your legacy. No, try \nto find a way around this freedom of speech in the United States \nSenate. Let's don't throttle it. We have come to a time, we say we are \ngoing to try to work this out. This ought not be all that difficult to \nwork out. As I said to the President of the United States in the \npresence of the distinguished Senator from Tennessee: Mr. President, \ntell your leadership up there not to push this, not to push this on the \nAmerican people. It is their freedom. The day may come when--and it has \nbeen in the past--the day may come when the Senator from Tennessee \nwishes to stand and use that filibuster.\n  The filibuster is not a very popular thing out there in the country \nmaybe.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not yet, if I may respectfully decline. I will shortly. The \nSenator from Tennessee may wish to stand on his feet and defend the \nbeliefs, the opinions, the rights of the people of Tennessee from a \nmajority. Over there is the majoritarian body, the House of \nRepresentatives. There is where majority rules. This is the forum of \nthe States. It is a forum for minorities, where we can have dissent on \nthe part of a minority. The majority is not always right. The majority \nhas been wrong before. And so I say, let's protect the rights of the \nminority to filibuster, if I may use that word.\n  Yes, we have engaged in filibusters on judicial matters before. I was \nhere when the President of the United States wanted to make Abe Fortas \nthe Chief Justice. I voted on that. That was a filibuster.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, will the Senator yield just for a quick \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, yes, I yield. I ask unanimous consent that I \ncan yield under the rules for a question, without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have a very brief question. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia mentioned what he said in my presence and the \npresence of other Senators yesterday. We were at the White House \ntalking about important issues--foreign affairs--but he, I think very \nappropriately, brought up this issue. The Senator from West Virginia \ndid make the point that he just made about the importance of not \nleaving a legacy, as you described it. My legacy would be very \ndifferent because of the principle of a fair, up-or-down vote, after \nfreedom of speech, extended debate for as long as is reasonable in \nterms of getting all the issues out there. That is what the American \npeople want. They want a nominee to come over, be fully debated, \neverything about them, counter, debate, back and forth, freedom of \nspeech.\n  The Constitution, the wonderful history you just gave us----\n  Mr. BYRD. Praise God. Here it is, freedom of speech.\n  Mr. FRIST. Freedom of speech. Let's see it next week. Take someone \nwho is on the Executive Calendar now. Take them to the floor, and let's \nhave freedom of speech--somebody who has waited 4 years for the \nappropriate freedom of speech coming to the floor--and then do--this is \nmy question. I do not want to go into a long speech because I know we \nall have other engagements we need to get to. Let me ask the question. \nDidn't you also say, as the other part of that statement to the \nPresident of the United States, being critical of the potential legacy \nI might leave in order to stand up for fairness and principle, didn't \nyou also say you would give all of these nominees an up-or-down vote on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate?\n  Mr. BYRD. I am willing to give nominees, if there is a handful of \nthem--\n  Mr. FRIST. An up-or-down vote on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Isn't \nthat what you said yesterday to the President of the United States?\n  Mr. BYRD. I said I am willing to give them an up-or-down vote, just a \nhandful.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't mean six of them, five of them, or four of them or \nthree of them. I have never attacked the Senator's desire to be looked \nupon as a leader who was fair. I have never attacked him.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, another quick question, reserving the \nSenator's right to the floor. Yesterday, in the Senator's statement to \nthe President of United States, it was to the seven nominees he \ndelivered to us about whom the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nsaid: I want them, or I am willing to have--I don't know if the Senator \nwants or is willing to have an up-or-down vote on the seven nominees--\ndidn't the distinguished Senator from West Virginia tell the President \nof the United States and other Senators that at the same time he \naddressed my legacy?\n  Mr. BYRD. Just as the Senator has had a little difficulty in \nrecalling whether I said this or that, I didn't have a written text \nbefore me when I spoke to the President. I don't remember if I said a \nfew or all or three or four. I don't remember. I am willing to have \nsome votes up or down.\n  Let's get around this Damocles sword that hangs over the Senate of \nthe United States and act as reasonable men and women and vote some of \nthem up or down. Whatever the leader decides is fine. Let's don't talk \nabout this nuclear option. Let's don't bring that down at this time. I \nam not referring to the legacy of the distinguished Senator in a \ndisparaging way. I am not doing that at all. The leader----\n  Mr. FRIST. One more brief question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, but let me finish my sentence.\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, through the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. The leader has it within his power to go forward on all \nseven or six or five or four, whatever it is, or he has the power to do \nit on less than that number. It seems to me that a reasonable \ncompromise could be reached among Senators. I am interested in helping \nto effectuate such a compromise. If it means an up-or-down vote on one \nor two or three or four, whatever, it seems to me to be reasonable if \nwe can give and take--that is what we are expected to do, give a little \nhere, give a little there--and let's get out of this morass, this \nterrible threat to the freedom of speech in the Senate of Senators. \nThat means freedom of speech on the part of my people back home who \nexpect me to speak for them.\n  I hope the leader will think about that. My goodness, they have a \nshirt\n\n[[Page S5036]]\n\ntail full of nominees, and we are going to wreck traditions? Talking \nabout traditions, the tradition of the Senate is freedom of speech, \nfreedom of debate, freedom to dissent.\n  Mr. President, this reminds me very much of a book in the Bible, a \nbook that is titled Esther, the Book of Esther. I think it would be \nespecially good for the distinguished majority leader to be reminded of \nthe Book of Esther in the Bible.\n  I won't go into it all here, but Esther was a Jew. She had a cousin \nwho sat at the king's gate every day. He was a Jew. His name was \nMordecai. The word went out that a man who had been favored by the \nking, a man named Haman--H-A-M-A-N, I believe it is. Here is my Bible. \nThis is the King James version of the Bible. I don't read any other \nversion of the Bible except the King James version. I speak as a born-\nagain Christian. We hear that thrown around a lot around here. I am a \nborn-again Christian and have been since 1946.\n  My wife and I will soon be married, the Lord willing, in about 16 or \n17 more days, 68 years. We were both put under the water in that old \nchurchyard pool under the apple orchard in West Virginia, the old \nMissionary Baptist Church there. Both Erma and I went under the water. \nSo I speak as a born-again Christian. You hear that term thrown around. \nI have never made a big whoop-de-do about being a born-again Christian, \nbut I speak as a born-again Christian. Hear me all you evangelicals out \nthere, hear me.\n  So here we were, we were baptized. But getting back to Esther, her \ncousin, Mordecai, sat at the king's gate day after day, and he refused \nto do homage to the king. The king was Ahasuerus, and his wife's name \nwas Vashti. The king asked Vashti to come in before all the big shots \nin the kingdom, and she refused to come. So his advisers advised him to \nput her away and get a new queen. So they brought in all the beautiful \nvirgins--perhaps not all of them, but they brought enough to dazzle the \nking's eyes--and they chose Hadassah, that is Esther, after whom the \nbook is titled.\n  She was the king's new queen and she got word from Mordecai that word \nwas going out from the king's top man named Haman that all the Jews \nwere to be killed on a certain day. So Mordecai told her that, and she \ntold the king and the king said: Who did this? Who said that?\n  So the finger was put upon Haman. Haman was the chief leader there of \nKing Ahasuerus. Well, time went on and old Haman was advised by his \npeople to build a gallows and hang on those gallows Mordecai, and on \nthat same day to kill all the Jews throughout the 127 provinces of \nPersia.\n  I will go to the point of the story quickly. It ended with Haman, the \nman who built the gallows on which to hang Mordecai, himself being \nhanged on those gallows. It did not stop there. The ten sons of Haman \nwere executed on those gallows, also.\n  I say this to the distinguished Senator, hear me, hear me. I am \nwilling to give some up-and-down votes on some judges. That is a little \nthing. But it is a big thing if it is carried too far. Judges do not \nhave to go before the people to be voted on like the Senator from \nTennessee, the Senator from Nevada, and I have to do. They are \nappointed for life, and this is the only place where they can be \nscrutinized.\n  Well, in the case of Haman, he was executed on his own gallows. I say \nto the leader of the Republican Party in this Senate, the worm turns \nand there will come a day when the majority leader of the Senate will \nbe on this side of the aisle. I have seen it happen back and forth time \nand again. It can happen again. That worm will turn.\n  I say to the leader, please do not ``Hamanize,'' if I may coin a \nword, the Senate. Remember Haman. The leader and his party may someday \nbe on the same gallows that we in the minority find ourselves on today, \n``Hamanized.'' Do not travel that path because the leader and his party \nmay someday be executed on the same gallows. Think about it. Do not \n``Hamanize'' the Senate of the United States.\n  I thank the distinguished leaders for listening. I hope my words will \nnot have been in vain. I plead with them, please do not ``Hamanize'' \nthe Senate of the United States. Take us out of that straitjacket. I \nknow both leaders have been working but work some more. If I can help, \nlet me in, count me in. I want to help.\n\n  Talking about the American people, they are the ones who are \nsuffering from this delay. We could be doing something about matters \nthat confront most people every day. I appeal to both leaders to let \nreason reign for a while. Let us reach a judgment to get on with the \nbusiness of the Senate, but for Heavens' sake do not kill freedom of \nspeech in the Senate.\n  Do I still have the floor, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I say, finally, my apologies to the Republican leader and \nto the minority leader, and thank them for listening. But how much land \ndoes a man need? How much land does a man need? Tolstoy wrote a great \nstory. How much land does a man need?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senators should be advised that the Senator's \nhour of postcloture time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator another hour.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished leader. I have the floor. Thank \nGod for the Senate, I said, when I was in that body over there.\n  Finally, I say to my good leader, I will pose a rhetorical question. \nHow much land does a man need? Leo Tolstoy wrote a story about a man \nnamed Pahom, I believe it was, but regardless of the man's name, this \nman had orchards and fields of grain and lands, but he had land hunger. \nHe wanted more land. He kept getting more land, but he always wanted \nmore land. The upshot of it was there appeared before him one day a \nstranger who offered him all the land that he could cover in a day, \nlike that Tennessee land.\n  Mr. FRIST. Good land.\n  Mr. BYRD. He offered him all the land he could cover in a day for a \nthousand rubles.\n  He thought, this is my chance. So he took off on an early morning and \nhe had never seen land so rich as this was. So he decided he would walk \n3 miles. He left his servant there with the stranger. The 64-dollar \ncatchword was, he had to be back at the starting point before the sun \nwent down or he would lose his thousand rubles.\n  So he started out and he decided he would walk 3 miles. After he \nwalked the 3 miles, it looked so good he thought he would walk 3 more \nmiles, and he walked 3 more miles until he had covered 27 miles before \nhe turned up on the second side. He covered the second side, and he sat \ndown and he ate from the humble bag of provisions that his good wife \nhad prepared for him, a little cheese and bread, and then he launched \nout on the third side of the square and he covered the third side. But \nas the long afternoon wore on, the land became less hilly, more rocky. \nSo he struggled to reach the end, to reach the starting point before \nthe sun went down because otherwise he would lose all. He would lose \nhis thousand rubles, and he would lose the land that he covered.\n  Mr. President, I see the leader has left. He left me all alone here. \nWhat about this? Hey, where is my adversary? Where is my worthy \nadversary? Come on now. Where is the leader? Am I to be left here alone \nto be gored by the horns of those--where is my adversary? He is not to \nbe found.\n  Anyhow, let me bring this long story to an end. In the end, the man \nwas crawling on his hands and knees. The sun was going down. He looked \nahead of him and he saw the starting point. He saw the dim face of the \nstranger waiting on him at the starting point, the stranger who had \noffered him all the land that he could cover in a day for a thousand \nrubles. He saw a grim smile on the face of that stranger. So, \npainfully, he inched himself forward little by little. His arms were \nbleeding from the rocks and the briers and the sticks that had gone \nthrough his skin. He reached the starting point just as the Sun went \ndown, but he fell dead on the spot.\n\n  The stranger said: I promised him all the land he could cover. You \nsee how much it is: 6 feet long and 2 feet wide. The stranger, called \nDeath, said: I have kept my pledge.\n  So, Tolstoy asked, How much more do you want? How many nominees have \nwe confirmed in this Senate? How many? May I ask the question without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n\n[[Page S5037]]\n\n  Mr. REID. It is 208.\n  Mr. BYRD. And how many have not been confirmed?\n  Mr. REID. Ten.\n  Mr. BYRD. And 7 of those are back before the Senate, out of 218? My, \nhow much land does a man need? How many nominees do they want? Mr. \nPresident, just send up some new nominees; it is that simple.\n  Mr. President, I thank all Senators. I am ready to proceed on the \namendment, if the Senator would like.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I inquire of the Chair, are we still on the Byrd amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me just make one answer on the question you had, How \nmuch more land? I refer to Jabez, you are familiar, in the First \nChronicles. They say: ``Expand my territory.'' So we want more.\n  I make a point of order the pending Byrd amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I may speak for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I made my case. I think it is a good case. I \ndo recognize that some amendments that are offered are not germane. It \nwas my hope that, by presenting the amendment, the Chair will rule it \nis germane. I will accept the ruling of the Chair. I will not attempt \nto override the Chair's ruling if he rules against my point, but I have \nmade my case. I thank the distinguished Senator, and also I thank \nSenator Baucus, the manager on this side, for the consideration they \nhave given. I will abide by the decision of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is \nnot germane. The point of order is well taken, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I don't know if we have people on the \nfloor with amendments. I am hoping that we do. While all these subjects \nwe are addressing are important, we are operating under some real time \nconstraints. We have been on this bill now almost 2 weeks. We have \nworked on the bill for 3 years. This is probably the most significant \npiece of legislation we will be handling, and I encourage my colleagues \nto confine their interests to this bill and encourage as many of them \nas have amendments that they seriously want to be considered that they \nbring those amendments to the floor. We have the list now down to about \n140 amendments. I know from past experience just a fraction of those \nwill want to have serious consideration.\n  I make that request and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend from \nOklahoma, several days ago Senator Hatch and I were told that we could \nspeak on the floor at 2:15. So I ask unanimous consent that I can speak \nas in morning business, that I will be followed by Senator Hatch, and \nin deference to our friend from Oklahoma, who makes a very good point, \nthat this time be charged postcloture.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I inquire of my friend \nfrom Oregon how much time he is requesting as in morning business.\n  Mr. WYDEN. As I said or touched on in my earlier comment, Senator \nHatch and I had talked several days ago with the cloakrooms on both \nsides. We do want to be sensitive to our colleague. His point is valid. \nI think both of us could finish our remarks in about 10 minutes each, \nor thereabouts.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is 10 minutes for each of you?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will not object. Let me propound a \nunanimous consent request; that is, the combined remarks of the Senator \nfrom Oregon and the Senator from Utah not extend beyond 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                  Citizens' Health Care Working Group\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I are taking this time to \nprepare our colleagues in the Senate and the public for a health care \nrevolution that is long overdue. Right now, just over the river in \nArlington, a group of dedicated citizens from every corner of the \ncountry is preparing to do something that has never been done before, \nand that is to tell the American people the hard truths about where \nnearly $2 trillion in health care goes each year and then to walk the \npublic through the tough choices that must be made to create a health \ncare system that works for all Americans.\n  The Citizens' Health Care Working Group was created by a law that I \nwrote with Senator Hatch. That law is just now beginning to be \nimplemented. Beginning this week, the American people will have a place \nto go to find out more about the working group. I encourage them to \ntake the opportunity to go to this Web site and learn about a very \nfresh approach to delivering health care for all of our citizens.\n  For 60 years, our country has tried the same thing. Literally from \nHarry Truman in 1945, in the 81st Congress, through 1993 and 1994 in \nthe Clinton administration, the effort was to write legislation in \nWashington, DC. Then the American people would find it hard to \nunderstand, various interest groups would attack the legislation and \neach other, and everything would die.\n  Under the law I have written with Senator Hatch, this approach is \nturned on its head. Instead of starting in Washington, DC, the Health \nCare That Works for All Americans law begins outside the beltway. I \nwould say to the Senate, I think health care reform has been like \ngetting dressed in the dark for both the public and for policymakers. \nThe American people have never been told where the money is going, so \nhow can they, in a thoughtful way, offer suggestions on what needs to \nbe done to improve the system? Without this essential information from \nthe American public, how then can policymakers write legislation that \nthoughtfully addresses the public's concerns and garners the public's \nsupport?\n  This time, beginning in the fall, that is going to change. In senior \ncenters and libraries, at business organizations, online and offline, a \nHealth Care Report to the American People will lay out the facts for \nthe first time. The public is going to be told in understandable \nlanguage the facts as to where the $1.8 trillion spent each year on \nhealth care goes. Then the American people will have the opportunity--\nagain offline and online--to give their ideas about how to create a \nhealth care system that works for everyone. For the first time, public \ninvolvement will be followed by political accountability.\n\n  Under the law, once Americans learn where the health care dollar is \ngoing and they have the chance to talk about how they would rather \nspend those dollars, Congress must follow up. All the committees of \njurisdiction have to hold hearings within 60 days of the \nrecommendations coming from the citizens of our country.\n  Once there is a clear citizens' roadmap to health care that works for \nall Americans, it will be hard for Congress to reject the citizens' \nhealth care needs. Congress can continue to ignore what the citizens \nare calling for, but with genuine public momentum behind this effort, \nCongress will ignore the citizens at its peril.\n  For the first time, with this approach, there is the potential to \ncreate a true juggernaut to get a bill a President of either political \nparty can sign. It is about time.\n  If Americans do not have their health, we all understand nothing else \nmatters. Before I had the honor of coming to the Congress, I served as \ndirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. I saw then how important it was \nthat a fresh, innovative approach be taken in this area.\n  Two weeks ago, the chairman of Starbucks sat in my office. This is a \ncompany that gets it when it comes to health care. They are doing \nsomething that is hard for any company to do, providing health \ninsurance not only to their full-time employees but to their part-time \nworkers. They have done this because their founder, Howard Schultz, \nremembers what it was like to grow up in a family at risk because they \ndid not have health care. He believes a secure, covered workforce \ncontributes to his company's great business success. But Howard Schultz \nwill tell us, just as other concerned business leaders will tell us, \nthey may not be able to keep that commitment if costs continue to grow \nexponentially.\n  What I appreciate about what Starbucks is saying is they are not\n\n[[Page S5038]]\n\nwaiting for the bottom to fall out. Mr. Schultz has come to Washington \nto ask that the Congress and the executive branch partner with \nbusinesses that want to do the right thing and to cover their \nemployees. He does not have all the answers, but he told me and Senator \nHatch as part of this bipartisan law that makes a break with 60 years \nof failure in this area, he wants to try fresh approaches. Since \nmillions of Americans come in contact with Starbucks each week, that is \na pretty darned big contribution and an indication of what the business \ncommunity is willing to do as we take a fresh look at coming up with \nhealth care that works for all Americans.\n  Frankly, what we have heard from Starbucks and others is exactly the \nkind of teamwork we wanted when we wrote the law. We are talking about \na unique approach where the public has the facts, where the public gets \na chance to weigh in, where Congress then has to act. This kind of \napproach, where you rewrite the book with respect to health care \nreform, is long overdue. There are going to be tough choices. Senator \nHatch and I have acknowledged that at the very beginning. Certainly \nend-of-life issues present us with some very difficult, gut-wrenching \nconcerns but establishing this kind of process is, in the view of \nmyself and Senator Hatch, absolutely critical if our country is to move \nand to move quickly to deal with the health care challenge in the days \nahead.\n  This health care wrecking ball is not going to hit in 2040 or 2050, \ncolleagues. We are going to get clobbered on New Year's Day 2007 when \n70 million baby boomers start retiring.\n  I see my friend Senator Hatch is here and Senator Inhofe has been so \nkind to give this time so I will wrap up. I encourage each Senator to \nurge their citizens at home to get involved with the Citizens' Health \nCare Working Group. They are going to be getting out into the \ncommunities across the country, making their information available \nonline. This is their Web site. I encourage Senators to have folks at \nhome ready to pitch in.\n  I thank my partner in this effort, Senator Hatch. If we look at the \nimportant health care legislation in the last few years, Senator \nHatch's name is virtually always on it, whether it is programs for kids \nor how to address issues relating to pharmaceuticals. I could not have \na better partner in the Senate as we try to break new ground in health \ncare.\n  I yield now so Senator Hatch can have the time. I do it with my \nthanks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just over 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will not take all that. I apologize to the managers of \nthe bill for taking this time.\n  For over 60 years, Washington has tried to come up with a way to \nprovide access to health insurance for all Americans. The premise of \nthis bill is that instead of relying on Washington for answers, we rely \non the people.\n  I compliment my colleague from Oregon for coming up with this idea. I \nam very happy to sign on and help him with it, the Health Care That \nWorks For All Americans: Citizens' Health Care Working Group \nlegislation. It was created in order to hear what people like and do \nnot like about the current health care system.\n  It is our hope this working group of citizens will have at least one \ntownhall meeting in every State in the Union, pick the brains of all \nAmericans, and see if we can come up with answers to our health care \nproblems. We provide a mechanism once they do for the Congress to at \nleast consider it and see what we can do to go from there.\n  This is one of the biggest issues we all have to face.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, everywhere I go in Utah, people tell me how \nconcerned they are about health care. They are worried about the lack \nof health insurance, skyrocketing premiums, and unaffordable \nprescription drugs. They are worried that if they are diagnosed with a \nserious disease like cancer, they will be wiped out financially, even \nif they have health insurance. They are worried about losing their \nfamily doctor because he or she can no longer afford medical liability \npremiums.\n  There is no question there are problems with America's health care \ndelivery system. And we have even more problems when the Government \ntries to impose a one-size-fits-all program on country. That's why \nSenator Wyden and I reached across the aisle to start a meaningful \nnational discussion with every day people.\n  A few years ago, Senator Wyden came to my office and told me he had a \n``terrific idea'' and that he wanted me to be a part of it. I am glad \nhe did. I came to learn that we both have a strong desire to get past \nthe partisan bickering and forge a consensus that would address the \nproblems plaguing our health care system. We both decided to take this \nproblem right to the American people. We want those who deal with these \nissues day in and day out to have their say. And, hopefully, when the \nprocess is finished, we will have a national consensus on how best to \nimprove our health care system.\n  The Health Care That Works For All Americans: Citizens Health Care \nWorking Group legislation was created in order to hear what people like \nand don't like about the current health care system. It is our hope \nthat there will be at least one town hall meeting in each State. The \nworking group members will hear from the full range of people within \nour health care system--including health care consumers, health care \nproviders, and others who are impacted by health care.\n  For nearly 60 years, Washington has tried to come up with a way to \nprovide access to health insurance for all Americans. The premise of \nthe Wyden-Hatch bill is that instead of relying on Washington for \nanswers, the working group should hear from people outside of \nWashington regarding our health care system. The voices of all \nAmericans, insured and uninsured, must be heard and that this issue \nneeds to be addressed.\n  Today, 45 million Americans are uninsured and 8 million of the \nuninsured are children. We cannot allow these individuals to go without \nhealth care coverage. That is why I sponsored the CHIP legislation in \n1997 to address this serious matter for children.\n  To me, the most appealing aspect of this Citizens Working Group is \nthat it is unique from other previous commissions that were run by \nWashington insiders. This working group is composed of individuals from \nall over the country who have had experience with the current health \ncare system. These are people who have had dealings with different \nfacets of our health care system, and they want to make it better. They \nwill talk to people from all over the country about what is working and \nwhat isn't working. And then they will put together recommendations, \nbased on what they heard from their fellow citizens, for Congress and \nthe administration to consider. Again, let me emphasize that the \nrecommendations will come from the bottom-up, rather than being imposed \nfrom Washington. This is crucial because one of the first tasks of the \nworking group is not only to get the views from the public but also to \nhelp them better understand our health care system. And once these \nrecommendations are issued, Congress will hold hearings to address \nthem.\n  This week, the Citizens' Health Care Working Group members are being \nbriefed on various issues related to our health care system including \nan overview of the health care system, public health insurance programs \nsuch as Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, the private health insurance market, the uninsured, and \ndrivers of health care costs. In addition, the working group will be \ndiscussing the future field hearings, the required report to the \nAmerican people, and begin consideration of approaches for conducting \nthe community meeting.\n  Again, I am very hopeful about the innovative health care proposals \nthat will be produced by the citizens' working group and want to \nencourage my colleagues to familiarize themselves with this important \neffort.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon and the \nSenator from Utah. They have a great deal of passion on their subject \nand they have worked long hours. I appreciate the fact they recognize \nwe are considering what many people consider to be the most significant \nbill this year.\n  Again, we will renew our request for Members to come down with their \namendments. We have hotlined it\n\n[[Page S5039]]\n\ntwice. I want to make sure I say that enough times for Members. Senator \nJeffords joins me in this. They have hotlined it on their side. If \nMembers want their amendments considered, if Members want floor time, \nif Members want a vote, come down, bring it down. I am waiting for that \nto happen. We are open for business. We encourage Members to come.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I agree with the Senator's statement and call upon \nSenators to be here so we can get this work done.\n  Mr. INHOFE. It is urgent. Let me state why it is urgent. We have a \ndeadline. We are on not our fourth, fifth, but our sixth extension \nright now. When you operate on extensions, as we have said over and \nover again, you cannot get anything done, you cannot have any of the \nreforms, you cannot take care of donor States, you cannot have \ninnovative methods of financing. That is all in the bill. Core safety \nprovisions are in the bill. None of that will be a reality if we do not \nget this bill.\n  Why is it such a rush? This extension expires on the 31st of May. \nThat is 19 days from now. We have to get this done. If we get this bill \nfinished tonight, we will have time to have it over into conference and \nstart working on it in conference in time to get the conference report \nback to the House and back to the Senate and to the President's desk \nprior to the expiration of this extension on May 31.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I emphasize we are running out of time. \nWe cannot keep going this way without getting anything done. We have a \nresponsibility to do so. I urge Members who have issues they want to \nraise, please come now.\n  Close to 50 years ago, Congress passed and President Dwight D. \nEisenhower signed into law the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956.\n  As Chairman Inhofe has pointed out a number of times during the \ndebate on this bill, that legislation is one of the greatest public \nworks projects in history and is credited with the creation of one of \nthe biggest transportation systems in the world.\n  President Eisenhower was a thoughtful man, but his first realization \nof the value of good highways was noted in 1919, when he participated \nin the U.S. Army's first transcontinental motor convoy from Washington, \nDC, to San Francisco.\n  When Eisenhower and a friend heard about the convoy, they volunteered \nto go along as observers ``partly for a lark and partly to learn,'' \nEisenhower later recalled. On the way West, the convoy experienced all \nthe woes known to motorists, and then some: an endless series of \nmechanical difficulties; vehicles stuck in the mud or sand; trucks and \nother equipment crashing through wooden bridges; roads as slippery as \nice or dusty or the consistency of ``gumbo''; extremes of weather, from \ndesert heat to Rocky Mountain freezing; and, for the soldiers, worst of \nall, speeches and speeches and more speeches in every town along the \nway. On September 15, 1919, after 62 days on the road, the convoy \nreached San Francisco, where it was greeted with medals, a parade, and \nmore speeches.\n  During World War II, General Eisenhower saw the advantages Germany \nenjoyed because of the autobahn network. He also noted the enhanced \nmobility of the Allies when they fought their way into Germany.\n  These experiences shaped Eisenhower's views on highways. ``The old \nconvoy,'' he said, ``had started me thinking about good, two-lane \nhighways, but Germany had made me see the wisdom of broader ribbons \nacross the land.''\n  Thankfully, these experiences helped guide President Eisenhower as he \ndeveloped and pushed for the creation of the Federal-Aid Highway Act. \nIn 1955, President Eisenhower said:\n\n       Together, the united forces of our communication and \n     transportation systems are dynamic elements in the very name \n     we bear--United States.\n       Without them, we would be a mere alliance of many separate \n     parts.\n\n  We stand here now on this Senate floor, 50 years later, trying to \nimprove and maintain the roads and highways created by the legislation \ninspired by President Eisenhower.\n  The bill before us makes great strides in State efforts to reduce \ntraffic congestion and make our roads and bridges safer. It will help \nmaintain and expand our mass transit systems, and it creates jobs and \nhelps our economy. This bill will improve transportation in every State \nand have an impact on every American in one way or another.\n  Once again, I thank Chairman Inhofe and Senators Bond and Baucus for \ntheir efforts in moving this bill forward. We have made good progress \nthis week, and I know the momentum will continue today, and hopefully \nit will start soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for an \nexcellent statement. That historic perspective is important for a \nnumber of reasons. The whole highway system under Eisenhower came as a \nresult of a quest for national security. That was almost 50 years ago, \nand we have been funding highways the same way we did 50 years ago. We \nhave not changed at all.\n  We have this excise tax. In the bill we are to pass--and hopefully it \nwill get passed today and sent on to conference--we have new and \ninnovative ways of financing. We allow the States to use their ways. We \ngive them more latitude toward their methods of financing highways. We \nalso appoint a national commission to study how we could do this in the \nfuture so we will not be standing up here 6 years from now talking \nabout the same problems we have today.\n  If we operate on an extension, that is not going to happen. I made a \nlist of all these things that are not going to happen if we have just \nanother extension. We are on the sixth extension right now.\n  Let me, first of all, encourage anyone who is going to offer an \namendment to come down and do so.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  But while we are waiting, Mr. President, let me respond to one of the \nstatements that was made about an hour ago--or was it 2 hours ago--when \nthey were talking about a floor vote.\n  Regardless of how you interpret the Constitution on advice and \nconsent, sometimes I say I am a very fortunate person in this body \nbecause I am one of the few Members of the Senate who is not a lawyer. \nSo when I read the Constitution, I know what it says. It says we are \nsupposed to advise and consent. It means a majority of us are going to \nhave to determine whether a nominee who is presented by the President \nof the United States is one who is, in fact, acceptable.\n\n  What we have been asking for, as our leader articulated many times--\nand apparently the senior Senator from West Virginia agreed with the \nPresident yesterday--is just an up-or-down vote. That is all we want, \nan up-or-down vote.\n  Now, is this so outrageous? I will go back and quote some of my good \nfriends on the Democrat side who are opposed to an up-or-down vote.\n  Senator Biden, on March 19, 1997, said:\n\n       But I also respectfully suggest that everyone who is \n     nominated ought to have a shot, to have a hearing and to have \n     a shot to be heard on the floor and have a vote on the floor. \n     . . .\n\n  Senator Boxer said, on May 14, 1997:\n\n       It is not the role of the Senate to obstruct the process \n     and prevent numbers of highly qualified nominees from even \n     being given the opportunity for a vote on the Senate floor.\n\n  Senator Durbin, who has been very outspoken, said, on September 28, \n1998:\n\n       Vote the person up or down. They are qualified or they are \n     not.\n\n  Mrs. Feinstein, one of our fine colleagues, the senior Senator from \nCalifornia, on September 16, 1999, said:\n\n       A nominee is entitled to a vote. Vote them up; vote them \n     down. . . .\n\n  Now, apparently, their interpretation of the Constitution is what \nmine is.\n  Senator Kennedy, on January 28, 1998, said:\n\n       But we should resolve these disagreements by voting on \n     these nominees--yes or no.\n\n  I agree with Senator Kennedy.\n  Senator Kohl, on August 21, 1999, said:\n\n       These nominees, who have to put their lives on hold waiting \n     for us to act, deserve an ``up or down'' vote.\n\n  Senator Leahy, on October 22, 1997, said:\n\n       I hope we might reach a point where we as a Senate will \n     accept our responsibility--\n\n\n[[Page S5040]]\n\n\n  That is us.\n\n     and vote people up or vote them down.\n\n  Senator Schumer, on March 7, 2000, said:\n\n       I also plead with my colleagues to move judges with \n     alacrity--vote them up or down.\n\n  So I am saying that I agree with all of my good Democrat colleagues \nthat we should give them an up-or-down vote, and I have no question but \nthat the American people feel the same way. You see different polling \ndata, but when they are asked the question, Should these people be \nentitled to a vote up or down? they overwhelmingly believe they should.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I actually came over to have a little \ndiscussion with the distinguished chairman of the full committee who \nhas brought this legislation forth, Senator Inhofe. I thank him for the \nwork he has been doing. We had an issue we have been discussing, and I \nthink we have something identified to be helpful.\n  I came to talk about the highway bill, and I will do it to this \nextent: We need a bill. It is an overdue bill. It is important to our \ncountry. It is important to have infrastructure. It is important for \njob creation. It is important for economic development. And it is \nimportant for safety.\n  We ought to do this bill. I just cannot understand why the Senate \nstill heaves away from getting this extremely popular, overdue, and \nhighly necessary piece of legislation passed.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they have good amendments, let's do them. If \nwe can't get it completed this afternoon, let's do it as soon as \npossible. It is critical for our country.\n  We are speaking on time on the highway bill, but actually other \nsubjects have been introduced. I would like to comment on that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have been pleading with our colleagues \nto bring amendments down. Will the Senator, in the event an amendment \ncomes to the floor, then yield for consideration of that amendment?\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I want this legislation so bad, I would even stop talking \nmyself. That would be a major sacrifice, but yes, I would be glad to \nyield. But since the opportunity presents itself and I missed the \nopportunity to engage in the discussion an hour or so ago--not that it \nwas needed--I have had very little to say on the floor of the Senate \nabout the discussion about judges. There are a lot of different \nviewpoints. I am not going to refer to what others have said and I am \nnot going to suggest I am a great constitutional scholar or that I am \nso steeped in all of the rules and traditions of the Senate. But I have \nstudied this issue.\n  I have been in the Congress for now going on 33 years. I have read \nthe Constitution over and over again, particularly on this subject, \narticle II, section 2. I am somewhat familiar with the traditions and \nrules of the Senate. I am chairman of the Rules Committee. I have been \nin leadership roles. I must say that while we have had our \ndisagreements and while I have seen us make mistakes and while I have \nseen injustices heaped on each other, on the people who are affected by \nissues we deal with, I don't believe I have ever seen anything as \nunfair and wrong as what I have seen happening to these circuit court \nnominees over the past 4 years. This has been going on for 4 years.\n  I was stunned when it started happening with Judge Charles Pickering \nof Mississippi and Justice Priscilla Owen of Texas. I thought maybe \nthat was something aimed at me or maybe it was aimed at the Fifth \nCircuit Court of Appeals, or maybe it was a fit of anger about some of \nthe nominees from President Clinton who didn't get out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, but it would be a passing break from tradition. But no, this \nhas continued right on through the 108th. We need to find a resolution \nthat is fair to all concerned.\n  I wanted to correct a couple misimpressions, perpetuated primarily by \nthe media. The proposal to put the tradition back in place that we \ndon't filibuster Federal judicial nominees is not an end of the \nfilibuster. Some of the media--accidentally, I am sure--suggested this \nis a debate over whether to have the filibuster. No, it is limited to \nthe Federal judiciary. It won't affect our ability to continue to \nfilibuster legislation or other executive branch nominations, although \nI have to confess, I think there should be some reasonable limits on \nthat also. I am not a guy who gets so caught up in the institutional \nrights that I forget considering the rights of people and right and \nwrong. Does that have a place here in the Senate?\n  These good men and women and minorities have been maligned, \nmistreated, have had their lives disrupted, some of them for 4 years. \nSome of the best possible nominees such as Miguel Estrada said: Well, I \nhave to go on with my life. And he withdrew.\n  There has been a misimpression given about how this would limit the \nfilibuster. It would only apply to these judicial nominees.\n  The other thing is, Senator Frist and the Republicans are considering \nchanging the rules. Actually what we are considering doing is putting \ntradition back in place. The tradition has not been to filibuster \nFederal nominees. The tradition has not been to filibuster appellate \ncourt nominees. Not one time during the 6 years or so I served as \nleader did we have a filibuster. We are trying to go back to where we \nwere. You can argue over this example or that example or we should \nretain that right. No, that has not been the right. That has not been \nthe tradition. What has happened is wrong.\n\n  I saw somebody last night on one of the talk shows saying everything \nthat happens in Washington is about something else. This lady suggested \nthis whole debate is about the next Supreme Court nomination. Maybe \nthat is true. Maybe there are a couple other things it is about, but in \nthe meantime, innocent and qualified, good people are having their \nlives disrupted and smeared by this process.\n  I acknowledge this sort of thing has been going on ever since I have \nbeen in the Senate. Every time we have a filibuster or kill somebody or \nembarrass somebody in our process, whether it is Senator John Tower to \nbe Secretary of Defense or Clarence Thomas to be on the Supreme Court, \nJudge Bork as a nominee, every time we seem to drop down another level. \nSure, a lot of the Clinton nominees were held up in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Maybe this is retaliation for that. What is going to be the \nnext retaliation? How low can we go before we stop this tit for tat?\n  Now is the time to end it and go back toward greater comity between \nthe parties and the people involved in these discussions. I haven't \nbeen sitting on the sideline saying: Let's impose this rule. Let's \ncomply with the Constitution, which I think we should do. I want to \nmake that perfectly clear. I have one goal and only one goal, \nultimately, in this area, and that is to stop filibusters of these \nFederal judges. I don't particularly care how we get there, but that is \nthe right thing to do. I am determined to get there.\n  As chairman of the Rules Committee, we had hearings on and moved \nlegislation 2 years ago, sponsored by Senator Frist and Senator Zell \nMiller, to try to come to a fair conclusion about how these judges \nwould be handled. It was a process that said the first vote on cloture \nwould require 60 votes, then 57, then 55, but ultimately get to an up-\nor-down vote, a majority, but an elongated process to make sure \neverything that needed to be said could be said. It could be fully \nscrubbed, and at some point you get to conclusion. A filibuster, the \nway it is being used, is guaranteeing we never get to conclusion. It \ngoes on and on from one Congress to the next.\n  We reported out a bill. That apparently wasn't acceptable to the \nminority, the Democrats. So I started looking for other solutions. I \ndid talk to Senator Ben Nelson and others: Is there some way we can \naddress some of these concerns; is there some way we can guarantee that \nthese nominees are not unfairly held permanently in the Judiciary \nCommittee?\n  We came up with a process that said after 90 days, if the appropriate \nblue slips have been returned by the Senators from the State of the \nnominee affected, then they would come to the floor. They could not be \nheld in committee indefinitely, but if there was a problem that came up \nand they needed\n\n[[Page S5041]]\n\nan additional 90 days, agreed to by the chairman and ranking member, \nthen it could be extended. Ultimately, they would have to come out of \ncommittee and be considered by the full Senate. That would address one \nof the concerns that has been pointed out by Senator Reid and Senator \nLeahy and other Democrats. There is some merit to what they are saying. \nLet's fix that.\n  The second problem was freedom of speech, the great tradition in the \nSenate of endless debate. Give me a break. At any rate, to say the \nmajority leader could not even file cloture for at least 24 hours after \na nomination was called up--it could be longer--and then he could file \ncloture, and after 2 days we would eventually get to an up-or-down \nvote, but have a week for debate. By the way, Senator Frist \nsubsequently suggested that be moved even further. Every Senator would \nget an hour if he wanted it, full debate. I hate the thought of that, \ntoo, having to listen to 99 other speakers on a judge. Think about the \nsacrifice the majority leader has to make. When the majority leader has \nto give 100 hours to anything, how many judges could do you that on? It \nwould be another impediment. But we would have full debate and then a \nvote. That was the key. Fairness on the committee, full debate on the \nfloor, but ultimately a vote. That was rejected.\n  A lot of different ideas have been explored. A lot of Senators would \nlike to find a way to stop the way we have been doing business but \ndoing it where everybody could have some degree of comfort. I think \ntime is running out. I think we have to make a decision on this and \nmove on. Some people would say: Oh, my goodness, the Senate will be \nstopped, slowed down, with different agendas offered. How will we get \nanything done? The last time I checked, we have done four bills this \nyear. We are not exactly burning up the woods. How do you slow down \nfrom almost a dead stop? So there is a little bit of a temerity--I will \nnot use names to describe what the Senate is doing.\n\n  I think we need to work together. We have done it many times across \nthe aisle. We have worked with Senator Baucus of Montana on issue after \nissue. Senator Grassley won't have it any other way, to his credit. We \nought to find more ways to do it. We ought to find a way to do it on \nSocial Security. We have done it before. It took courage. We have done \nit on trade and we are going to do it again. It will take courage, \nsacrifice, and we are going to have to work to find a solution. We can \ndo that here.\n  But I guess the thing that really gets me the most is when we put our \ndescription of tradition and the great institution ahead of human \nbeings. When we have this debate, I see faces, people; I see Janice \nRogers Brown, from California, who has an incredible story to tell. She \nis being maligned. Is she a conservative African-American woman? Yes. \nIs that disqualifying? It should not be. You may not agree with her \nopinion of Franklin Roosevelt, but isn't she entitled to an opinion? \nAll the while, perhaps, she is ruling very fairly or even ruling \nagainst her personal beliefs, if that is what the court precedent calls \nfor.\n  Mr. President, I don't necessarily mean this as critical of the \ninstitution or any one individual, but I think there is an awful lot of \npontificating that has gone on too long here. Priscilla Owen, a supreme \ncourt justice in Texas, deserves a vote. She deserves to be confirmed. \nSomebody said she is too pro-business, she has a conservative \nviewpoint. Is that now disqualifying? I don't think so.\n  I have voted for judges I didn't agree with, perhaps on labor law. I \npoint out over and over again that I voted to confirm Justice Ruth \nBader Ginsburg. Certainly, she would not have been my pick, but she was \nqualified, experienced, and had proper decorum, and she was ethical. \nPresident Clinton won the election and so, based on that, I voted for \nher.\n  Surely, we can find a way to work this out. I think it has gone on \nlong enough. I have tried not once, twice, but three times to find a \nway that we can get the right result, which is an up-or-down vote on \nthese judges, and I have not been able to be successful yet. A lot of \npeople have tried, and I think they deserve recognition. Those of us \nwho have worked to try to find compromise have not been working against \nthe interests of our leadership. We told them what we were trying to \ndo. That is in one of the finer traditions of the Senate. But I cannot \nfind a solution that I think is fair, other than to make it clear that \nthese nominees deserve an up-or-down vote.\n  The Senate should vote. Some of them won't be confirmed, I predict. \nOne or two of the seven--the magnificent seven--that have been \nrenominated may not be confirmed. I would not be surprised to see that. \nI have voted for judges and against judges, but all of a sudden we \ndon't want to do that.\n  Let the Senate do what it is supposed to do. Let's ante up and kick \nin. Let's vote and solve this issue, get it done, and let's move on and \nlegislate for the best interests of our children and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his remarks. This \nbill is urgent. We have been, as I said, hotlining it. We have done it \ntwice on our side. I am waiting for responses to see what kind of \nprogress they are having on the other side of the aisle.\n  I want to get on record here so that Members can all be aware it \nappears we are down to about 10 amendments right now on this side of \nthe aisle. I think it would be very wise to continue to talk about this \nbecause we will be getting to a point where we are going to have to \ndraw this to a conclusion, and now it seems like it may be some \nworkable number.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             The Filibuster\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on January 31, 1963, I gave my maiden \nspeech in the Senate. That is over 40 years ago--42 years ago. At that \nmoment, the Senate was embroiled in a very heated debate on civil \nrights. The question before the Senate was the filibuster because many \nof my colleagues, especially those who were designated as liberals, \nlooked upon the filibuster as the major obstacle to the granting of \ncivil rights to the oppressed minority of this Nation. On that day, I \nwas given the right to the floor and I gave a short speech. I think it \nis quite relevant at this moment. If I may, these are the words of 31 \nJanuary 1963:\n\n       Mr. President, I fully understand the respected custom of \n     this body which advises a new member to sit in his chair, to \n     listen quietly and learn before he rises to speak to the \n     Senate himself.\n       There is wisdom in that custom, as there is in most customs \n     which last through years of trial and experience. I would not \n     willingly break that honored silence, but because this debate \n     calls to question the place of the minority in a democratic \n     political system, I feel I must say these few words in deep \n     but passionate humility, for I am a member of a minority in a \n     sense few other Senators have ever been.\n       I understand the hopelessness that a man of unusual color \n     or feature experiences in the face of constant human \n     injustice.\n       I understand the despair of a human heart crying for \n     comfort to a world it cannot become a part of and to a family \n     of man that has disinherited him.\n       For this reason, I have done and will continue to do all \n     that one man can do to secure for these people the \n     opportunity and the justice that they do not now have. But if \n     any lesson of history is clear, it is that minorities \n     change, new minorities take their place, and old \n     minorities grow into the majority.\n       One can discern this course in our own history by observing \n     the decisions of the Supreme Court, where the growth of the \n     Nation's law so often takes the form of adopting as the \n     opinion of the Court the dissenting view of the earlier \n     decision.\n       From this fact, we discern the simple example of a vital \n     democratic principle. I have heard so often in the past few \n     weeks eloquent and good men plead for the chance to let the \n     majority rule. That is, they say, the essence of democracy. I \n     disagree, for to me it is equally clear that democracy does \n     not necessarily result from majority rule but rather from the \n     forged compromise of the majority with the minority.\n       The philosophy of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights \n     is not simply to grant the majority the power to rule, but is \n     also to set out limitation after limitation upon that power.\n       Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of \n     religion: What are these but the\n\n[[Page S5042]]\n\n     recognition that at times when the majority of men would \n     willingly destroy him, a dissenting man may have no friend \n     but the law.\n       This power given to the minority is the most sophisticated \n     and the most vital power bestowed by our Constitution.\n       In this day of the mass mind and the lonely crowd, the \n     right to exercise this power and the courage to express it \n     has become less and less apparent. One of the few places \n     where this power remains a living force is in the United \n     States Senate.\n       Let us face the decision before us directly. It is not free \n     speech, for that has never been recognized as a legally \n     unlimited right. It is not the Senate's inability to act at \n     all, for I cannot believe that a majority truly determined in \n     their course could fail eventually to approach their ends. It \n     is instead the power of the minority to reflect a \n     proportional share of their view upon the legislative result \n     that is at stake in this debate.\n       To those who wish to alter radically the balance of power \n     between a majority in the Senate and a minority, I say, you \n     sow the wind, for minorities change and the time will surely \n     come when you will feel the hot breath of a righteous \n     majority at the back of your own neck. Only then perhaps you \n     will realize what you have destroyed.\n       As Alexis de Tocqueville said about America in 1835: ``A \n     democracy can obtain truth only as the result of experience; \n     and many nations may perish while they are awaiting the \n     consequences of their errors.''\n       The fight to destroy the power of the minority is made \n     here, strangely enough, in the name of another minority. I \n     share the desire of those Senators who wish to help the \n     repressed people of our Nation, and in time, God willing, we \n     shall effectively accomplish this task. But I say to these \n     Senators, we cannot achieve these ends by destroying the very \n     principle of minority protection that remains here in the \n     Senate.\n       For as de Tocqueville also commented: ``If ever the free \n     institutions of America are destroyed, that event may be \n     attributed to the omnipotence of the majority.''\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. That speech was given 41 or 42 years ago?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Forty-two years ago.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my distinguished friend, we have heard a lot of \nspeeches in the last several months on this subject, but I have to say \ncandidly that this is the best speech we have heard. This is \noutstanding, especially coming on the footsteps of the great Senator \nRobert Byrd who made a statement about the right to free speech.\n  As I look back at a very young Senator from a very small State taking \non people who had been here a long time, going against a majority of \nhis party, in a sense, certainly a lot, as a young Senator, shows why \n20 years prior to giving this speech he was a hero on the battlefield \nfor America and why he has been a hero on the battlefields of the \nSenate for all these many years.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Yes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I echo the comments of my good friend. The Senator from \nHawaii has given us an opportunity to listen to the goodness he has \ngiven us in many speeches. I thank the Senator for what he has done \ntoday.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator from Vermont is very kind. I should point \nout, I was very proud of my speech, but the consequences are rather sad \nbecause my so-called liberal friends avoided me for a few weeks after \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nlet me also echo my good friend. One of the real thrills I have had \nsince I came from the other body was when Bob Dole was here with the \nSenator from Hawaii, and the two of them made such a spectacular image \nof everything that is good about this country and how good we feel. \nEvery time I look at the Senator from Hawaii, I see a true American \nhero.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma very \nmuch.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1011 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nbills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I renew our plea for Members to bring \ntheir amendments down. We are making progress in terms of shortening \nthe list. I would like to announce on our side we have hotlined it \ntwice and we are down to 11 amendments by 9 different authors, \ndifferent Senators. I encourage those nine to come to the floor while \nwe have ample time. It is my understanding that after a couple of \nhotlines on the other side of the aisle, they only have about six \namendments. That being the case, we could actually move the bill, if we \ncan get these people down and get them to offer their amendments.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is correct. We have only six we know of.\n  Mr. INHOFE. We have made progress, anyway, looking at who is serious \nabout their amendments. I hope any staff or Members watching now would \nbe encouraged to bring their amendments down.\n  I yield the floor to the senior Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, America has come a long way since the first \nState safety belt laws were passed two decades ago. I am speaking today \nnot just as a proponent of reauthorizing the highway bill, but also to \nexpress my strong support for provisions in this bill designed to \npromote primary safety belt laws in the States. These laws help prevent \nfatalities and crippling, disabling injuries when auto accidents occur.\n  As many of you know, primary safety belt laws allow police officers \nto stop and issue citations to motorists they observe who are not \nbuckled up. Secondary safety belt laws, on the other hand, require a \nmotorist be pulled over for another offense before he or she can be \nissued a ticket for failing to wear a safety belt.\n  Today, 21 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have \nprimary belt laws and we know these laws are working. I am proud that \nin my home State of North Carolina--our home State, Mr. President--\nwhich enacted a seatbelt law in 1985, belt use rose to 86 percent in \n2004.\n  Let me review a little history. It was in July 1984, during my first \nfull year as Secretary of Transportation under President Reagan, that \nwe issued rule 208, resulting in the installation of airbags in \npassenger vehicles and the enactment of safety belt laws across the \ncountry. Rule 208 was designed to save as many lives as possible as \nquickly as possible. It successfully resolved a 17-year dispute that \nspanned four administrations.\n  The rule recognized the role of the States in automotive safety. Not \na single State at the time had passed a safety belt law. Usage was at \nonly 13 percent, and airbags were virtually nonexistent. In fact, I \nremember having to search high and low to find an airbag-equipped car \nso I could put it on the White House lawn for President Reagan and the \nCabinet to go out and examine.\n\n  There was very little consumer acceptance at the time. Many folks \nfeared when they crossed the railroad tracks that the airbag would go \noff. Today, motorists regard automotive safety quite differently. Most \nof us get in a car and we barely notice that the vehicle has an airbag. \nAnd most of us innately fasten our safety belts.\n  Statistics prove we have made great progress increasing safety belt \nusage and saving lives on our Nation's roads since those first State \nsafety belt laws were enacted.\n  Now, over 20 years later, we need to urge more States to take their \nlaws to the next level by enacting primary safety belt laws. The \nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates if all States \nenacted primary safety belt laws, more than 1,200 deaths and 17,000 \ninjuries would be prevented annually.\n  I take this opportunity to thank the folks at NHTSA, and especially \nAdministrator Dr. Jeffrey Runge, for their continued hard work and \nleadership to increase safety belt usage throughout our country. \nAccording to NHTSA estimates, in this year alone, 15,000 lives will be \nsaved--15,000--by wearing safety belts. The economic costs associated \nwith belt usage are significant as well. NHTSA estimates safety belt \nusage\n\n[[Page S5043]]\n\nsaves America $50 billion in medical care, lost productivity, and other \ninjury-related costs. By contrast, fatalities and injuries resulting \nfrom not wearing a safety belt generate $26 billion in economic costs \nannually. These costs include higher taxes and higher health care and \ninsurance costs.\n  The fact is safety belts reduce the risk of death in a severe crash \nby 50 percent. We must urge folks to use their safety belts. Increased \nusage rates and primary belt laws have a proven track record of doing \njust that.\n  With this legislation, States that chose to adopt primary safety belt \nlaws would receive a one-time grant equal to 500 percent of the highway \nsafety money they received in 2003. States that already have primary \nsafety belt laws would receive 250 percent of the 2003 level in highway \nsafety money. At the end of the bill's reauthorization in 2009, any \nleftover safety funds will be distributed to States that have enacted \nprimary belt laws.\n  With this increased funding, States can spend more on highway safety \nimprovements and make our roads even safer. NHTSA Administrator Runge \nbest described the importance of safety belt usage in April of this \nyear, when he told the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation \nCommittee:\n\n       Unlike a number of complex issues facing the Nation today, \n     we have at least one highly effective and simple remedy to \n     combat highway deaths and fatalities. Wearing safety belts is \n     the single most effective step individuals can take to save \n     their lives. Buckling up is not a complex vaccine, doesn't \n     have unwanted side effects, and doesn't cost any money. It is \n     simple, it works, and it is lifesaving.\n\n  I could not agree more. After two successful decades of State-\nimplemented belt laws, it is now time for this Nation to further \nimprove safety on our Nation's roads. We have accomplished many things \nto advance automobile and road safety over the last 20 years, and now \nwe must act on this opportunity to do even more.\n  I ask unanimous consent that NHTSA Administrator Runge's letter to me \non this matter be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway \n           Traffic Safety Administration,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Elizabeth Dole,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: I am writing to bring to your attention \n     my strong support for the safety belt State incentive grants \n     contained in S. 732, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and \n     Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2005 (SAFETEA).\n       The Bush Administration, along with the National SAFE KIDS \n     Campaign, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Automotive \n     Coalition for Traffic Safety, the National Safety Council, \n     the American Insurance Association, Advocates for Highway and \n     Auto Safety, the Automotive Occupant Restraints Council, the \n     American College of Emergency Physicians, the Alliance of \n     Automobile Manufacturers, and the National Automobile Dealers \n     Association all support this provision. They support it \n     because it will save more lives, and do it faster and cheaper \n     than any other proposal the Senate will consider this \n     Congress, and perhaps this decade. If all States adopted a \n     primary enforcement safety belt law, 1,275 deaths and 17,000 \n     serious injuries would be prevented every year. No other \n     proposal in SAFETEA will do more to improve safety than this \n     bipartisan proposal.\n       While deaths per vehicle mile traveled are at an all-time \n     low, the carnage on our highways is still too high. In 2003, \n     42,463 people died and 2.9 million were injured due to motor \n     vehicle crashes. The cost to our economy was over $230 \n     billion.\n       With the number of vehicle miles traveled increasing each \n     year, if we as a Nation are going to reduce the fatalities on \n     our streets and highways, safety belt use must also increase. \n     No vehicle mandate, no complex rulemaking, no public \n     education campaign will save as many lives as a meaningful \n     incentive to pass primary safety belt laws. Congress has the \n     power to grant the incentives and that power will save lives.\n       I urge you to support the safety belt incentive grants in \n     S. 732 and reject any amendments. Thank you for your \n     consideration.\n       Sincerely yours,\n                                            Jeffrey W. Runge, M.D.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the SAFETEA bill in the Senate today is a \ngood bill. I strongly support its passage.\n  I thank Senator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bond, and Senator \nBaucus for their good leadership and their good work, particularly on \nthe Environment and Public Works title of this bill. The roadway safety \nand funding provisions they have crafted are vitally important.\n  Let me also thank Senators Stevens, Lott, Inouye, and McCain for \ntheir hard work on the Commerce Committee vehicle and behavioral safety \ntitle.\n  Finally, let me thank Senator Rockefeller for his support as the lead \ncosponsor of the safety provisions I have authored that are part of \nthis bill.\n  Staff on both the Commerce Committee and the EPW Committee also \ndeserve praise and thanks for their hard work on this bill. In \nparticular, I thank Ruth Van Mark, Chris Bertram, David Strickland, and \nJames O'Keeffe and JC Sandberg for their willingness to work with my \noffice on portions of the bill I wanted included. These are portions of \nthe bill I will describe in a minute that have to do with highway \nsafety, provisions that I believe truly will save lives. I thank them \nfor their very good and diligent work.\n  I also thank Kevin King of my staff for his hard work on these safety \nprovisions in the bill.\n  While certainly we would like to include more funding for highway and \ntransit projects, I commend my colleagues for doing an excellent job in \nstretching the funding that is available as far as it can go.\n  The language Senators Grassley and Baucus have drafted adding \nadditional funding helps. I am a strong supporter of their efforts. We \nneed the funding that the managers' package provides to improve the \nrate of return for donor States, such as my home State of Ohio, to get \nthose levels up as high as possible.\n  Additionally, the managers' package contains the Commerce Committee \ntitle of the bill relating to safety programs. This title is \ncomprehensive and deserves the full support of the Senate.\n  I will take a few minutes now to talk about the safety provisions I \nhave asked to be included in the bill. First, I will say something \nabout Senator Lott's provisions on the Primary Safety Belt Incentive \nGrant Program.\n  I thank Senator Lott. I congratulate him for including this \nprovision, a provision that will clearly save lives. Senator Lott came \nto the Senate floor earlier and spoke about the importance of this \nprovision. I must say what Senator Lott said is absolutely correct. \nThis provision must be kept in the Senate bill. It must be kept through \nconference. Efforts to modify or remove primary safety belt incentive \ngrants will undermine the national goal of reaching 90 percent safety \nbelt usage. Encouraging States to aim low when it comes to saving lives \nmakes no sense. Such efforts to change this language in the bill must \nbe opposed.\n  Some States already have primary enforcement laws. Those laws are the \nsingle cheapest and most effective means for saving lives on our \nNation's roads. Those States that have already enacted primary seatbelt \nlaws have seen lives saved. Other States, such as my home State of \nOhio, do not have primary seatbelt laws. These States would benefit \ntremendously in terms of lives saved and financial bonuses under \nSenator Lott's program. The incentive program may be the only way to \nget some States to adopt primary laws.\n  In Ohio alone, it is estimated we could save nearly 100 lives per \nyear if we added primary belt laws. If we maintain this provision, \ncountless lives will, in fact, be saved. The highway experts, the \npeople who study this issue, who understand it, tell us this is the \nsimplest, cheapest, easiest way to save lives. It is the one thing we \ncould do to save lives in this country the easiest way.\n  So I thank Senator Lott and commend his efforts and urge my \ncolleagues, if there is an amendment offered to take this provision \nout, that they oppose that amendment.\n  Let me say a few things about the provisions in the bill that I have \nbeen working on and I have asked to have included and that have, in \nfact, been included. First, Senator Rockefeller\n\n[[Page S5044]]\n\nis the lead cosponsor on our provision that we call Stars on Cars. \nWhile the name is kind of cute, its focus is quite serious.\n  Today, when you go to buy a new car, we all know there is a large \nlabel on that car, a large label on the window telling the price, the \nfeatures, and other information about the vehicle. Most of the content \non the sticker is actually mandated by the Federal Government. The \nsticker has to tell you whether the vehicle has a stereo, the car's \nmileage, how many miles per gallon, and so on. But one piece of vital \ninformation, amazingly, is not there, and that is the safety ratings. \nHow safe is that car? That piece of information is not on the sticker.\n  Citizens have a right to know this information, and our provision \nwould provide, for the first time, that information would be available \nright on that car, right in the showroom when you walk in to buy the \ncar. Taxpayers have already paid to have the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, NHTSA, test cars for this information. We have \nalready paid for the information. In fact, NHTSA has put this \ninformation up on the Internet. It is available on the Internet now. \nBut, nonetheless, this information is not available to the American \nconsumer in the one place where it would be most helpful, the one place \nwhere it would truly make a difference: where you buy the car, on the \nface of the car when you buy it at the dealership.\n  Our provision would add a new section to the label that would clearly \nlay out information from each of the crash tests. You would have the \ninformation about frontal crash impact, side impact, and rollover \nresistance. It would show the test results as star ratings on the \nlabel, just like many automakers already do in their commercials. This \nis a commonsense provision, and it is one that will allow consumers the \nopportunity to make more informed decisions for themselves and their \nfamilies.\n  We have found over the last few years that consumers are much more \nconscious about the safety of the cars they buy, wanting to put their \nfamilies in safe cars. This is a proconsumer, prosafety provision that \nmakes good common sense. I congratulate the committee for including it \nin this bill.\n  Another provision in this package that Senator Rockefeller has \ncosponsored with me is what we call the Safe Kids and Cars Act. Now, \naccording to NHTSA, automobile crashes are the leading cause of death \nfor those ages 4 to 34. More than cancer, more than fire, more than \nanything else, auto accidents are the source of child fatalities. We \nall know that.\n  The focus of the child safety initiative we have incorporated in this \nbill is on an emerging danger for small children that is often \noverlooked. It is referred to as ``nontraffic, noncrash'' accidents. \nWhat are those? Well, these are incidents in which there is an \ninteraction between an automobile and a child which leads to injury or \ndeath when the vehicle is not on the road or there is no actual crash \nwhich has occurred. Instead, these are accidents that happen inside \nparked cars, in driveways, or other common, potentially deadly \nsituations.\n  We provide two different things in this title. The title includes two \nvery different sections relating to the Safe Kids and Cars initiative. \nThe first one directs NHTSA, for the very first time, to perform \nregular collection of data on nontraffic, noncrash injuries and deaths. \nWe need that information. We need that as a matter of public policy. If \nwe are going to prevent them, we have to understand them. We are not \ncollecting the data today. We do not fully understand it.\n  Further, we have another section that deals with the so-called back-\nover deaths and requires NHTSA to investigate this issue and the \ntechnologies that might help prevent such accidents in the future. \nThese back-over deaths occur in driveways, people's homes. Quite often, \nevery year, a child is backed over and killed. They are becoming more \nfrequent, as people have vans where you cannot see out of the back of \nthe van very well.\n  We need to better understand the cause of these accidents. We need to \nhave better information. NHTSA needs to investigate this issue and \nneeds to look at the technologies that might help prevent such \naccidents.\n  Another provision we have included in this bill we call dangerous \nroads and intersections. Senator Rockefeller and I have worked on this \nprovision. Every State in the Union, of course, has dangerous roads, \ndangerous intersections. Most States, fortunately, rank these. Most \nStates come up with a list of what are the dangerous roads, the most \ndangerous places in the State. They keep a list of them. But, \namazingly, there are many States that keep this information secret and \nnever tell the public.\n  Citizens have a right to know this information. What would you do \nwith the information? Well, if you are a parent, you might tell your \nchild to avoid a certain road: Don't go that way to the movie. Don't go \nthat way to the restaurant. Don't go that way on a date. Go a different \nway. You have a right to know that information. Or if the public knew \nabout a road that was statistically very dangerous or the State knew \nthat it was dangerous, maybe the public would demand that road be \nfixed. That is the type of vital information the public has every right \nto know.\n  Our provision requires that safety information be disclosed to the \npublic as an eligibility requirement for a new Federal safety funding \nprogram, the Highway Safety Improvement Program. States seeking \nadditional Federal dollars for safety construction projects will have \nto identify their danger spots, rank them according to severity, and \nthen disclose them to the public. It is pretty simple. Most States are \nalready doing it; they just have to disclose it. This is another \ncommonsense provision that truly is going to save lives. I am pleased \nit has been incorporated into this highway bill.\n  The fourth issue covered by language in the bill that I included, \nalong with Senator Rockefeller, has to do with driver education and \nlicensing. Teen driving is an area where the fatality rates are very \nhigh. Unfortunately, current programs are many times not getting the \njob done. Higher crash and fatality rates for teenage drivers can be \nreduced if we work at it. The Federal Government can't run driver \neducation. It is a State responsibility to set standards. But the \nFederal Government can play a small yet significant role and a \nproductive role. Revitalized driver education needs to be data driven. \nWe can help teenage drivers avoid high-risk situations, particularly in \nthe first 6 months behind the wheel. Integration of driver education \nwith graduated licensing must also be addressed.\n  The language we have included in the bill creates a driver education \nand licensing research program within NHTSA. This program will go out \nand test what works and what doesn't and come up with a ``best \npractices'' model that States can implement. The time has come to take \nserious action on driver education and licensing. This program is a \nsolid first step. We need to have scientific data, and the Federal \nGovernment is in a good position to come up with this data to assist \nStates as they develop good criteria.\n  Finally, I have worked with Senator Lautenberg to include a provision \nin the highway bill to reduce the number of drinking and driving deaths \nand injuries each year. Statistics are staggering. In 2003, 17,013 \nAmericans died in what we believe were alcohol-related incidents. NHTSA \nprojects this number dropped to 16,654 in 2004, a 2.1-percent \nreduction. While this is good news, it certainly is still too high. We \ndo want to see the trend continue. To help accomplish that, the \nlanguage we have supported requires NHTSA to work with the States to \nconduct combined media-law enforcement campaigns aimed at reducing \ndrunk driving fatalities.\n  Specifically, the law enforcement portion of this bill consists of \nsobriety checkpoints in the 39 States that allow them. In the States \nthat don't allow them, it provides for saturation patrols. The Centers \nfor Disease Control estimates the sobriety checkpoints may reduce \nalcohol-related crashes by as much as 20 percent. That is a significant \namount. We should do all we can to help States reduce drinking and \ndriving. This provision will do that.\n  In conclusion, the fact is that auto fatalities represent the No. 1 \nkiller in this country of those between the ages of 4 and 34. In 2004, \nNHTSA projects that almost 43,000 people were killed on our Nation's \nroads. In 2003, the number\n\n[[Page S5045]]\n\nwas 42,643. In fact, in the next 12 minutes, at least one person will \nbe killed in an automobile accident, while nearly 6 people will be \ninjured in the next 60 seconds. This is a tragedy we as a society are \nmuch too willing to tolerate. It is so common we kind of shrug it off \nand put up with it. These auto fatalities occur every day, every hour. \nAnd yet somehow we all have become immune to it. This year's highway \nbill takes some positive steps toward reducing those deaths.\n  I thank the sponsors for working with me on these safety measures \nthat truly will save lives. I commend them for their efforts and for \nincluding these provisions in the bill. I urge my colleagues, once this \nbill goes to conference, to continue to include these provisions in \nconference.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was able to listen to the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. DeWine. He has always led this body in the concern for \nsafety. He points out the critical need to finish this bill. Hopefully, \ntoday we will finish this bill because we have the longest, most \ncomprehensive safety core section, title, in this bill that has ever \nbeen offered in any reauthorization since Eisenhower. That is why we \nsay, as I think Senator DeWine was pointing out, lives can be saved or \nlives can be lost, depending on whether we pass this bill.\n  We will not have the safety core programs if we merely have an \nextension. Right now we are on our sixth extension. An extension is \nnothing but a defeat, an admission that we are not able to get a bill \nthrough so let's have what we had before. That's actually an extension \nof what we passed 7 years ago. It doesn't have any of these things in \nit. If we have an extension, none of the safety core programs Senator \nDeWine was talking about would be included.\n  I can tell you--and I think everyone knows--statistically, it is an \nabsolute that people will die; not just adults driving, but one of the \nthings in this bill is the Safe Routes to School provision which would \nsave young lives--kids going to school. So it is a life-or-death matter \nthat we pass this bill and pass it very soon.\n  When I say ``very soon,'' we ought to pass it today because the \nextension, this sixth extension I refer to, is going to expire on May \n31. If that happens, that means we will be forced to do another \nextension. What happens when you do extensions? Back in the States, \nthey do not have any certainty in planning. It is not as if you can \nsay: We know now that we have an extension for 6 months, we can spend X \ndollars for 6 months. You can't do it that way, and everyone knows \nthat. You have to plan way in advance because you have to get the labor \npool together, get the contractors together, you have to get the bids \nout. In this bill, we do have a provision that would have some projects \nthat are ready to go, so the second this is signed into law we are \ngoing to start construction.\n  People will use this and say this is, in fact, a jobs bill--and it \nis. It is probably the biggest jobs bill we have had at one time since \nthe WPA. For every $1 billion of road construction, that translates \ninto 47,500 jobs, new jobs, good-paying jobs. Without this bill, of \ncourse, that is not going to happen.\n  We have a lot of people who are concerned, as I am, about donor State \nstatus. I can remember when we only had written into the law that each \nState would get back 75 percent of what they actually collected in \ntheir State. Slowly, over the years, I have watched it get increased. \nIt has gotten up to the point where it is today, and this was passed 7 \nyears ago. This was 90.5 percent; that is to say, every donor State \nwill get back at least 90.5 percent of what they pay in.\n  The bill we had last year was enhanced up to $318 billion. That would \nprovide every State got back a minimum of 95 percent. As it is now, \nwith the smaller number, even with the enhanced number from yesterday's \namendment, that brought it up by $11 billion to $295 billion. That \nstill only brings the donor status to 92 percent. But that is better \nthan 90.5 percent, where we are today.\n  If we have an extension, it will be 90.5 percent. There will not be \nany change.\n  The streamlining provisions of this bill will allow us to actually \npave, construct a fairly decent percentage more highways and bridges \nthan we would otherwise be able to do. Without this, and if we have an \nextension, we will not have this, and none of the environmental \nstreamlining provisions will be there.\n  There are two different sections of the bill that relate to the \nfinancing. We have not changed our method of financing roads in 50 \nyears. Since the Eisenhower administration it has been the same. We \nknow there are better ways of doing it where you can have partnership \ntypes of arrangements, something that would be very good for our \nsystem. Without a new bill, that is not going to happen.\n  A lot of the States are on the border. We have a border program, a \nrecognition that since NAFTA we have a lot of traffic through no fault \nof the States. You have to improve the NAFTA corridors we are talking \nabout in this bill. Without this bill, we will not have that.\n  The chokepoints are not currently corrected. That is why we call this \nan intermodal bill. It is not a highway bill, not just a transportation \nbill, it is an intermodal bill because it is all types of \ntransportation and the chokepoints in between. A lot of our problems \nare because of the chokepoints.\n  Last, we have firewall protection in this bill. The firewall \nprotection provides if you pay money into the trust fund when you are \ngetting 1 gallon of gas, that money is ensured to go toward building \nnew roads. There are many in this body who do not think that is \nnecessary. Many think we can go ahead and fund any kind of programs not \nrelating to transportation out of the trust fund, and they have been \ndoing it.\n  In fact, one of the Senators the other day was saying how offended he \nwas that we are taking some of the fix that is there that is not in \nuse; in other words, there is about a 5-cent credit that goes in and \ncomes out of the highway trust fund. That has nothing to do with \ntransportation. If you are going to establish a policy, pay for the \npolicy but do not pay for it out of the highway trust fund.\n  I have often said this is a moral issue. There may be loopholes that \nallow politics to steal money out of the trust fund, but it is still a \nmoral issue.\n  This bill has the firewall protection to make sure, for the first \ntime, people cannot raid the highway trust fund. All these things are \nin the bill. If we do not pass the bill, we will have an extension, and \nnone of these things are in the bill.\n  This is necessary to get this done, to pass this legislation, and not \njust go for another extension.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 569, as modified, and 602, as Modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Chambliss amendment \nnumbered 569 and the Cornyn amendment numbered 662 be modified with \nchanges at the desk and agreed to, that the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments as modified en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                     amendment no. 569, as modified\n\n       On page 217 after the matter preceding line 1, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  . 14TH AMENDMENT HIGHWAY AND 3RD INFANTRY DIVISION \n                   HIGHWAY.\n\n       Not later than December 31, 2005, any funds made available \n     to commission studies and reports regarding construction of a \n     route linking Augusta, Georgia, Macon, Georgia, Columbus, \n     Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama, and Natchez, Mississippi and a \n     route linking Savannah, Georgia, Augusta, Georgia, and \n     Knoxville, Tennessee, shall be provided to the Secretary to--\n       (1) carry out a study and submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a report that describes the steps and \n     estimated funding necessary to construct a route for the 14th \n     Amendment Highway, from Augusta, Georgia, to Natchez, \n     Mississippi (formerly designated the Fall Line Freeway in the \n     State of Georgia); and\n       (2) carry out a study and submit to the appropriate \n     committees of Congress a report that describes the steps and \n     estimated funding necessary to designate and construct a\n\n[[Page S5046]]\n\n     route for the 3rd Infantry Division Highway, extending from \n     Savannah, Georgia, to Knoxville, Tennessee (Formerly the \n     Savannah River Parkway in the State of Georgia), following a \n     route generally defined through Sylvania, Waynesville, \n     Augusta, Lincolnton, Elberton, Hartwell, Toccoa, and Young \n     Harris, Georgia, and Maryville, Tennessee.\n\n\n                     amendment no. 662, as modified\n\n       Strike section 1802(c).\n  Mr. INHOFE. I have left instructions if Senators arrive, interrupt \nus. We want to consider amendments. I am hoping I did not chase away \nanyone who is offering an amendment. We have about 10 amendments on the \nRepublican side and about 10 amendments on the Democrat side. That is \nmuch better than yesterday with 173 amendments out there. We have made \nprogress.\n  We agreed to two of these. If we can get the Members who are serious \nabout their amendments to bring them down, this is the time to do it. I \nanticipate, as is normally the case, at the last minute Members will \ncome down and say: I have to have time to present my amendment, and it \nwill be too late. Now it is not too late. There is time to consider any \namendment that is a germane amendment that is on the list.\n  What we have done is very difficult. We have worked on this bill for \n3 years. We had this bill passed out of this Chamber and to conference \na year ago this month. In conference, they dropped the ball, and we \nwere unable to get it through.\n  This time, the conferees have learned we will be able to get it back \nto the House and back to the Senate, get it passed in both Houses, and \nhave it signed by the President in time for the current extension that \nexpires May 31. That is ambitious, but it can be done. We try to figure \nthis out day by day and what can be done each day. I believe that will \nhappen.\n  The reason this bill is better than most bills is historically we \nhave not gone with formulas; we have gone with political projects. Some \npeople call them pork. I don't call building a road pork.\n  What we could have done--we need to have 60 Senators to agree to \nthis--we could have gone to 60 Senators and said, all right, we have a \npot of money, and we will take care of your problem in Louisiana, your \nproblem in Oklahoma, your problem in Arkansas, and get up to 60 \nMembers, 30 States, and we will pass the bill and forget about the \nother Members. That is not fair. Historically, that has been done.\n  We tried to take every conceivable thing into consideration. The \nPresiding Officer represents a small northern State. We have provisions \nfor the colder States, provisions for States out West, many of which, \nlike my State of Oklahoma, are donor States. These are factors in the \nbill, in the formulas.\n  The formula for allocation also has such things in it as per capita \nfatality. My State of Oklahoma has a high fatality rate. What does that \ntell you? It tells you we have a problem with bridges and roads. That \nis a factor in how much money is distributed to the States.\n  The number of interstate lane miles is a consideration. The weighted \nnonattainment and maintenance area population is considered. The \nnonhighway recreation is a consideration. Regarding low-income States, \nmine is below the average in the State of Oklahoma. Low-population \nStates--Senator Baucus has been very helpful in this bill. He is from \nMontana. Montana has less than a million people, but they have to have \nroads to connect all the interstate roads. Consequently, they will be \nin a position where it has to be a consideration that a low-population \nor low-density population State is going to be able to be treated \nfairly.\n  There are about 20 different considerations, but the bottom line is, \nyou are never going to come up with a formula where everyone says this \nis perfect, this is just what we want, my State is being treated \nfairly. There are many things in the formula I do not like as chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, this Senator from \nOklahoma. Nonetheless, I know everyone cannot be satisfied.\n  We have a good bill before the Senate. Members should realize how \nsignificant it is that we pass this bill and not just go to another \nextension.\n  Let me renew my request, as we will be doing every 15 minutes, for \nMembers to bring their amendments. I know Members are out there and \nhiding. We will find you. We are open for business. We want you to come \ndown and offer your amendment. We will have plenty of time to do it.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I cannot commend the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee enough. He has worked extremely \nhard on this legislation. He is exactly right, if we are going to \nfinish this bill, it is incumbent upon Senators to bring their \namendments to the floor. It is the only way we are going to finish this \nbill.\n  As Mr. Inhofe, the Senator from Oklahoma, is imploring Senators to \ncome down, I very much hope they heed his words. I thank him for those \nwords because it is so important to get this legislation done now. It \nis Thursday afternoon, and it seems to me there is a lot of time to get \nmost of this bill done today.\n\n\n               Rules Of The Road On Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, this Nation's fast transportation system works. Why \ndoes it work? Because every day millions of individuals choose to abide \nby the rules of the road. On our Nation's highways, millions of people \nsafely move great distances, at great speeds, in no small part because \ndrivers respect other drivers and abide by the rules that oblige them \nto stay within the white and yellow lines painted on concrete and \nasphalt.\n  When you stop to think about it, it is incredible. Here are thousands \nof pounds in one car and another car hurtling toward each other, at \nhigh speeds, yet they do not hit each other. They miss because the \ndrivers know they must stay, in America, on the right side of the road, \nin their lane, which prevents a catastrophe. It is amazing when you \nstop to think about it.\n  When drivers come to an intersection with a red and white stop sign, \nwhat happens? Drivers stop. Those of us on a cross street depend on \ndrivers stopping. The other cars at a stop sign on other streets of the \nintersection also depend on that.\n  When folks come to a red light, they stop. They wait for a green \nlight. They let the cars come through from the other direction. Few \nthings create more danger in traffic than running a red light.\n  Mr. President, the Senate works much the same way. The Senate gets \nthings done because day in and day out Senators choose to abide by the \nSenate's rules. The Senate has rules. We abide by them, and that \nenables us to get things done.\n  Every year, the Senate confirms hundreds of nominations, addresses \nhundreds of amendments, and enacts hundreds of laws because Senators \nrespect other Senators and abide by the rules of the road.\n  In the 108th Congress alone, the Senate confirmed nearly 1,800 \nnominations, agreed or disagreed to nearly 1,800 amendments, and \nenacted nearly 500 laws. Yet in the 108th Congress, the Senate \nconducted just 675 rollcall votes.\n  So what does that mean? That means in the 108th Congress alone, the \nSenate made more than 4,000 decisions with fewer than 700 rollcall \nvotes. In the 108th Congress, the Senate made more than 3,300 decisions \nby voice vote or by unanimous consent.\n  These numbers demonstrate what most Senators know in their bones: \nFive times out of six the Senate gets things done not by confrontation \nbut by Senators abiding by the rules of the road and cooperating with \nother Senators.\n  That is why it is so troubling that some in this Senate now threaten \nto try to change the Senate rules by breaking the rules. They plan to \ndisregard the rules and disregard the precedents. They want to run the \nred light.\n  The Constitution gives the Senate the power to set its own rules. \nArticle I, section 5, of the Constitution says:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. . . \n     .\n\n  The Senate has determined its rules through adopting the standing \nrules of\n\n[[Page S5047]]\n\nthe Senate. The Senate has readopted or made general revisions of its \nrules only seven times since 1789. The most recent general revision was \nin 1979.\n  The standing rules of the Senate continue from Congress to Congress. \nAs Senate rule V says:\n\n       The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to \n     the next Congress unless they are changed as provided in \n     these rules.\n\n  Rule V: ``The rules of the Senate shall continue from one Congress to \nthe next Congress unless they are changed as provided in these rules.''\n  Now, Senators have the right to debate changes to the rules. Standing \nrule VIII spells out that, even under circumstances where Senators may \nnot normally debate:\n\n     motions to proceed to the consideration of any motion, \n     resolution, or proposal to change any of the Standing Rules \n     of the Senate shall be debatable.\n\n  Standing rule XXII provides the procedure for bringing debate to a \nclose on:\n\n     any measure, motion, [or] other matter pending before the \n     Senate.\n\n  Senate rule XXII provides that ``any . . . matter'' includes \nnominations. That is how it is that Senators can debate at length any \nnomination that comes before the Senate, unless 60 Senators vote to \nbring that debate to a close.\n  And ``any measure . . . [or] matter'' within the meaning of rule XXII \non debate also includes a proposal to change the standing rules of the \nSenate because rule XXII of the Senate's standing rules spells out the \nprocedure for changing the standing rules. When it addresses bringing \ndebate to a close through cloture, rule XXII says:\n\n       [O]n a measure or motion to amend the Senate rules . . . \n     the necessary affirmative vote shall be two-thirds of the \n     Senators present and voting.\n\n  That is rule XXII. That is in the Senate rules, which continue over \nfrom Senate to Senate.\n  The Senate's rules, thus, provide a procedure for changing the rules. \nThat procedure involves the regular legislative process. That procedure \ninvolves fair and potentially extended debate. And that procedure \nrequires, if it comes to extended debate, ``the . . . affirmative vote \n. . . [of] two-thirds of the Senators present and voting.''\n  That is the way Senators can change the rules, if they choose to \nrespect other Senators, if they choose to abide by the rules of the \nroad, if they choose not to run that red light.\n  But what some are talking about is very different. What some are \ntalking about is using brute force to change the rules. What some are \ntalking about is running the red light.\n  Here is what they would do. They would use the raw power of the Vice \nPresident to sit in the chair of the Presiding Officer. They would have \nthe Vice President make a ruling that bypassed the Senate's rules for \namending the Senate's rules. They would have the Vice President make a \nruling that bypassed the Senate rules for how long Senators could \ndebate. They would have the Vice President make a ruling that broke the \nSenate's rules.\n  Now, article I, section 3, of the Constitution provides:\n\n       The Vice President of the United States shall be President \n     of the Senate. . . .\n\n  But that does not mean that the Vice President can make up the \nSenate's rules anew every day. The Vice President, just like any \nSenator, must abide by article I, section 5, of the Constitution, when \nit says:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings. . . \n     .\n\n  And when the Vice President acts as President of the Senate, the Vice \nPresident, just like any Senator, must abide by the standing rules of \nthe Senate. To do otherwise, would be an abuse of power.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to resist those who would break \nthe rules to change the rules.\n  Sir Thomas More, the British statesman and Lord Chancellor, resisted \nKing Henry VIII when More felt that Henry had broken the law. In Robert \nBolt's great play about More called ``A Man for All Seasons,'' More \nspeaks about the importance of abiding by the law.\n  The character William Roper asks More:\n  So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law?\n  More counters:\n  Yes. What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after \nthe Devil?\n  Roper replies:\n  I'd cut down every law in England to do that!\n  More responds:\n  Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you \nwhere would you hide . . . , the laws all being flat? This country's \nplanted thick with laws from coast to coast . . . and if you cut them \ndown--and you're just the man to do it--d'you really think you could \nstand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the \nDevil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake.\n  The Senate's rules protect us all. They protect the ability of the \nSenate to get things done through working together, not through \nmajorities that cut down all the opposition.\n  For two centuries, the Senate's rules have protected the rights of \nthe minority party, for Democrats and Republicans alike. After two \ncenturies, it would be a mistake to cut down those rules.\n  At the center of that forest of Senate rules are two mighty oaks. But \ndon't take my word for it. Let me quote the Senate majority leader.\n  In a forward that the senior Senator from Tennessee, the majority \nleader, wrote to a book published last year entitled ``Senate Procedure \nand Practice,'' the majority leader wrote:\n\n       [A]bove all, together the Senate's rules and practices form \n     a whole. It is a whole that faithfully reflects the Framer's \n     design and ambition for the body. It is a whole that remains \n     true to the Senate's two paramount values: unlimited debate \n     and minority rights.\n\n  ``[U]nlimited debate and minority rights.''\n  ``[U]nlimited debate'' allows Senators to protect ``minority \nrights.'' The Senate's rules thus help to protect personal rights and \nliberties. The Senate's rules help to ensure that no one party has \nabsolute power. The Senate's rules help to give effect to the Framers' \nconception of checks and balances.\n  Even law school dean and former judge and special prosecutor Kenneth \nStarr told CBS News that changing unlimited debate might damage the \nSenate. He said:\n\n       It may prove to have the kind of long-term boomerang \n     effect, damage on the institution of the Senate that \n     thoughtful Senators may come to regret.\n\n  The Senate's right of unlimited debate is particularly important in \nthe context of nominations for the lifetime jobs of Federal judges. The \nSenate's involvement in the confirmation of judges has helped to ensure \nthat nominees have had the support of a broad political consensus. The \nSenate's involvement has helped to ensure that the President could not \nappoint extreme nominees. The Senate's involvement has helped to ensure \nthat judges have been freer of partisanship and more independent.\n  The Framers wanted the courts to be an independent branch of \ngovernment, helping to create the Constitution's intricate forest of \nchecks and balances. The Senate's involvement in the confirmation of \njudges has helped to ensure that the judiciary can be that more \nindependent branch. And that independence of the judiciary, in turn, \nhas helped to ensure the protection of personal rights and liberties \nfrom the winds of temporary majorities.\n  It is easy to push down the accelerator and cross that white line of \npaint, running across the concrete or asphalt. It is easy to push down \nthe accelerator to run through that stop sign. It is easy to push down \nthe accelerator and run through that red light.\n  But once one has been hit by a car running a red light, can one ever \nlook at an intersection the same way?\n  The Senate works because, day in and day out, Senators choose to \nrespect other Senators and abide by the Senate's rules of the road. If \nand when the Vice President and Senators start breaking those rules to \nchange the rules, the Senate will never be the same. Once they run that \nred light, the rule of the road can never be the same.\n  I urge my colleagues to slow down, take their foot off the \naccelerator, and stop, before it's too late.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          ISRAELI INDEPENDENCE\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, one of the most gratifying aspects of \nserving in the U.S. Senate is the opportunity to come to this Chamber \nand talk about and celebrate the great events in American and world \nhistory. One such event occurred 57 years ago today, and that is the \ncreation of the nation of Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East \nand the eternal homeland for all Jews around the world. Israel, our \nenduring friend and everlasting ally, was reborn from its biblical \nbirthright on this day in 1948.\n  Two years ago on the 58th anniversary of the end of World War II in \nEurope and again this week on its 60th anniversary, I spoke about how \nAmerican soldiers successfully fought both the fascism in Europe that \nspread like a cancer across that continent and Adolf Hitler's efforts \nto eradicate the Jewish race.\n  Last week, we honored the souls of those murdered in the holocaust on \nYom Ha-shoa--the Day of Remembrance. And today we celebrate the result \nof all of this history which is Israel's independence.\n  My father, Richard DeWine, when he was serving in World War II in K \nCompany, which was part of the Army's 103rd Infantry Division, went \ninto one of the Nazi concentration camps--Dachau--after it had been \nliberated. Although K company did not participate in the liberation of \nDachau, the 411th Regiment of their 103rd Division did liberate the \ncamp at Landsburg, Germany.\n  When my father was at Dachau, a camp where over 28,000 Jews had \nperished, the prisoners had already left the camp. He has a vivid \nrecollection, though, of seeing the ovens that the Nazis used to burn \nthe bodies of so many of the prisoners.\n  He can still picture in his mind the devices they used to slide the \nbodies into the ovens and the many urns that contained the prisoners' \nashes. He remembers going into a room next to the ovens and seeing \nfixtures on the walls that looked like showerheads. Those at the camp \ntold him the prisoners were taken into these rooms and the prisoners \nwere told they were going to take showers, but instead of water coming \nout of the nozzles, poisonous gas was emitted, killing them.\n  My dad remembers walking down the road near the camp and encountering \na very weak, emaciated man who had, a short time before that, been a \nprisoner. My dad and his buddies talked to the man and gave him food \nand cigarettes. They asked the man, who a short time before had been a \nprisoner, if they could take his picture. He said, yes, as long as it \nis with an American soldier. So they did. My dad still has that picture \ntoday.\n  Carl Greene, who was also a member of K Company, remembers their \nvisit to Dachau. He says some of the former prisoners in the camp still \nwearing those unforgettable striped uniforms actually served as their \nguides to show them around the camp, showing them the gas chambers and \nthe crematorium and the area in the camp where the Nazis would shoot \nprisoners in the back of their heads.\n  K Company member Al Eucare, Sr., who was 18 years old at the time, \nremembers what he describes as one-man pillboxes that stood outside the \ngates of Dachau. These were cylindrical pipes that stood upright, just \nbig enough for a man to fit inside. They were something of a sentry \npost. Each of these concrete tubes contained an open slat at the top \nand the bottom, where guns were placed to shoot at prisoners if there \nwas a disorder as the prisoners went in and out of the gates.\n  Like my dad, Al also remembers the ovens at Dachau. He said when he \nwas there, even though it was after the camp was liberated and the war \nhad ended, there were still ashes and skeletal remains inside those \nhorrible ovens.\n  Al also remembers seeing hooks--something akin to meat hooks--that \nthe Nazis would hook dead bodies on like cattle, to move them more \neasily. He said they would put the bodies on by hooking them right \nunderneath the jaw. He had heard stories that sometimes live Jews were \nplaced on the hooks and left until they died.\n  General Dwight Eisenhower visited some of the death camps and \nreported back what he saw. In one of his reports, this is what the \ngeneral described:\n\n       On April 12, 1945, I saw my first horror camp. It was near \n     the town of Gotha. I have never felt able to describe my \n     emotional reactions when I first came face to face with \n     indisputable evidence of Nazi brutality and ruthless \n     disregard of every shred of decency. Up to that time, I had \n     known about it only generally or through secondary sources. I \n     am certain, however, that I have never at any other time \n     experienced an equal sense of shock.\n\n       I visited every nook and cranny of the camp because I felt \n     it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify at \n     firsthand about these things in case there ever grew up at \n     home the belief or assumption that ``the stories of Nazi \n     brutality were just propaganda.'' Some members of the \n     visiting party were unable to go through the ordeal.\n       I not only did so, but as soon as I returned to Patton's \n     headquarters that evening, I sent communications to both \n     Washington and London, urging the two governments to send \n     instantly to Germany a random group of newspaper editors and \n     representative groups from the national legislatures. I felt \n     that the evidence should be immediately placed before the \n     American and British publics in a fashion that would leave no \n     room for cynical doubt.\n\n  That was Dwight David Eisenhower.\n  To think about it now, it defies credulity to consider that these \natrocities were occurring and there were those who questioned their \nreality or those who today even question their reality. My father said \nthat was one of the things that struck him when he visited Dachau 60 \nyears ago--the idea that there were townspeople right there who would \nnever admit the death camp was out there. He talked to people and they \nwould not admit it. They said they didn't know anything about it. They \ndidn't know what was going on so close. They acted as though it didn't \nexist.\n  Fortunately, the world came to reveal what was happening. The world \nknew, and although the rebirth of Israel came upon the heels of the \nmodern tragedy of the Nazi death camps, it is important to remember \nthat the Jewish people have struggled to regain their homeland ever \nsince biblical times. The year 1948 marked the culmination of those \nefforts. After 6 million Jews were murdered in World War II, surviving \nJews from across Europe and Asia made the trek to the holy land. They \nsought their homeland and peace. They obtained the former but not the \nlatter.\n  One such man seeking a homeland and peace was Mark Steinbuch, the \nlate father of one of my Judiciary staffers, Robert Steinbuch. Born in \nPoland, Mark and his family lived under Nazi occupation, relocated to \nSiberia shortly after the start of World War II, and then traveled for \n2 weeks by cattle car to live in Soviet Kazakhstan.\n\n  Mark's extended family faced some horrific challenges. Many were \nkilled by the Nazis. His cousins, the Hershenfis family, were forced \ninto labor in the Pionki ghetto in Poland. In 1941, the family was \nshipped off to Auschwitz. Hanna and her brother Harry were separated \nfrom each other and from their parents Fay and Harvey. Fay and Harvey \nnever made it out of the death camp. Hanna, tattooed with the number \nA14699, was shipped to an intermediate camp and then Bergen-Belsen. \nHarry--B416 to the Nazis--worked hard labor in Auschwitz for 4 years, \nand then, in 1944, was sent to another camp called Mauthausen.\n  On May 3, 1945, the Nazis fled the camp. That night, the skies opened \nand sent down a rainfall as if the world were being cleansed from the \nhorrors it had seen. The next morning, the Americans arrived and the \n11th Armored Division liberated the camp. Three days later, Harry \nturned 26.\n  After 5 weeks in an American hospital, Harry spent the next 3 years \nin a displaced persons camp in Austria. In 1949, Harry's wishes were \nanswered, and he set off for America. Four years later, when Hanna also \ncame to the United States, the siblings were reunited for the first \ntime since they were shipped off to Auschwitz 13 years prior. Harry is \n86 now and Hanna is a few years younger. Both are alive and well. \nHarry's sense of humor is strong, and he plays down the difficulties he \nfaced. But we all know better.\n  Upon the defeat of the Nazis, Mark Steinbuch's immediate family went \nto Germany because, as Mark described it, ``that is where the Americans \nwere\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\nand, if you wanted to live, you went to the Americans.'' From there, \nMark joined the Zionist youth movement and set off for Israel.\n\n  That, however, was no easy task. Traveling across Europe, often on \nfoot to a southern port, he, his brother, and many others like them \nboarded an overloaded freighter renamed the ``Theodore Hertzl,'' after \nthe founder of the Zionist movement. Upon the ship's arrival in Israel, \nthe British quickly arrested its passengers and sent them to a holding \ncamp in Cypress. Months later, Mark and the others were allowed to \nenter Israel.\n  Upon the joyous declaration of independence, seven Arab nations \ninvaded Israel, and Mark quickly joined the army. Underage and \nflatfooted, he fought for the independence of this new democracy.\n  Mark's story is by no means unique. It not only represented the goals \nand desires of the Jews of postwar Europe but the dreams of a nation of \npeople dispersed from their homeland for millennia.\n  Mark's dreams were realized a year later when armistice was struck. \nIsrael survived its first challenge. It, like the Jewish people after \nthe Holocaust, was still alive.\n  Since then, Israel's existence has been continuously challenged. \nIsrael defended itself from foreign aggression during the Suez Canal \ncrisis, the Six Day War, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War, the \nwar in Lebanon, and periods of extreme terrorism. Israel survived it \nall. OPEC blackmailed the world by withholding oil from the West \nbecause of their support for Israel. Israel's Olympic athletes were \nmurdered by terrorists. And the United Nations equated Zionism with \nfascism. Israel survived it all and much more.\n  Israel is a survivor, but it is also so much more. The people of \nIsrael have forested the desert, revived their language, built cities, \nand established a vigorous and ever-growing community.\n  We support Israel because it is a democracy, because it shares our \nvalues and ideals, because it has been willing to suffer attacks at our \nrequest, and because simply it is our friend. We welcome other nations \nto choose to be the same, and for the many that have, we share the same \nrelationship.\n  America is a nation of justice, fairness, and principles. So is \nIsrael. And on this day, we wish our friend a happy and joyous \nanniversary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                          Retirement Security\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak to the \nSenate and those following this debate about a dramatic change that is \ntaking place in America, even as we meet and discuss so many other \nimportant issues. One of the pillars of family security in America is \ncrumbling. Retirement security in this country is in a crisis. The \ndefined benefit plan, the kind of pension plan that guarantees a \nretirement amount to a worker who gives a lifetime of loyalty to his \ncompany or his employer, is becoming an endangered species.\n  The number of employees covered by employer-paid defined benefit \nplans has fallen from 30 million to 22 million in the last 20 years. By \ncontrast, the number of people in defined contribution plans, into \nwhich both worker and employer pay with no guaranteed payout, has grown \nto about 55 million from 19 million.\n  This trend, along with the steep losses that people with defined \ncontribution plans, such as 401(k)s, have experienced in the last few \nyears, and President Bush's plan to shift part of the Social Security \nguarantee into private accounts, frankly, means that we are going to \nput at risk retirement security in America, more than we have seen in \nmodern times.\n  Tuesday night, a bankruptcy court decided to allow United Airlines to \nshift responsibility for its defined benefit pension plan to the \nFederal pension insurance system. United Airlines moved all four of its \npension plans into the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with the \npromise that United Airlines would pay that corporation $1.5 billion. \nThe willingness of PBGC to accept this arrangement, unfortunately, \nrings the death knell for defined benefit pension plans in America.\n  United is the latest and the largest example of the fact that \ncorporations are no longer keeping their promises to employees, and the \nGovernment insurance system that was designed to protect employees in \nthe case of such catastrophe has become overused and underfunded to a \ncritical State. And this, coupled with the lack of personal savings, \nwith the dramatic increase in consumer debt of families across America, \nwith the growing vulnerability of families to medical bills, and with \nthe assault on guaranteeing benefits of Social Security by this \nadministration, is leading this Nation to a point that could not even \nhave been imagined just a few years ago.\n\n  There used to be a three-legged stool that you could count on for \nyour future. Everybody knew it. You went to work; every payroll you \npaid into Social Security, which would be there when it came time to \nretire; you took some of your paycheck and you paid into your pension \nsystem, if the company provided one, and then, if you could, put some \nmoney into savings. The idea is that all three would come together to \ngive you a sense of security and comfort in your old age.\n  The Chicago bankruptcy court that decided Tuesday night that United \nAirlines could walk away from its pension commitments unfortunately \nforeshadows many changes to come, and none of them positive, for \nworking people and working families across America.\n  United Airlines, the second largest airline in America, is in \nbankruptcy. It took the pension liability which it had into the \nbankruptcy court and said: We have to walk away from it. The bankruptcy \ncourt agreed. And when United Airlines turned over all of its pension \nplans to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, it basically said it \nwould save $645 million a year that it would not have to put into the \npromised payments to pension plans for its employees.\n  Judge Eugene Wedoff presided over that decision. To an overflow \ncourtroom on Tuesday, he said this was unavoidable. To quote him \nexactly:\n\n       The least bad of the available choices here has got to be \n     the one that keeps an airline functioning, that keeps \n     employees being paid.\n\n  And that was the choice. From his point of view, to ask United to pay \nwhat it promised to pay to its employees and to its retirees would mean \nthat the airline may cease to exist. But to walk away from those \nresponsibilities for the employees and to say instead that the airline \nwould survive certainly raises many troublesome questions.\n  The way that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is structured, \nit only guarantees that a part of pension plans it took over from \nUnited and other companies based on a pretty complicated formula would \nactually be paid to the employees. So many employees, whether United \nAirlines employees or others whose plans are taken over by this \ncorporation, lose part of their pensions. In this case, it is estimated \nthat United employees will lose an average of 25 percent of their \npensions under this arrangement.\n  Keep in mind what these employees have been through. They have been \nbattered by record layoffs. They have made voluntary pay and benefit \nreductions for years. They have increased their hours. They have made a \nlot of personal sacrifices to reach this point. And now, as it appears \ntheir airline was nearing the end of bankruptcy, comes this decision to \nwalk away from the pension obligation.\n  United is the second largest airline. It operates more than 3,400 \nflights a day to more than 200 destinations. It is based in my home \nState of Illinois. It has 60,000 employees and thousands of retirees, \nall of whom will be affected by this decision.\n  Let us take a look at each of the groups of employees at United and \nhow they will be impacted. The United flight attendants pension plan \ncovers 28,600 participants. Under this Government takeover of the \npension plan, the most senior flight attendants will receive about $500 \nless a month than the $2,500 they were promised in pension payments, \nabout a 20-percent cut. This is significant because most of them have \nnever earned more than $40,000 a year. Flight attendants who are less \nsenior and have less flying hours with the company could lose up to \nhalf of what they would receive with their promised pension plan. They \nhave said\n\n[[Page S5050]]\n\nthey may strike on this. I hope it does not come to that, not just \nbecause of the fact that it is a corporation in my State but because I \nam a loyal customer of United.\n  Sixteen Senators recently joined me in a letter to the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation asking for that agency to explain why it \nagreed with United to turn over all four pension plans since as \nrecently as 2 weeks ago officials of the same agency told negotiators \nthey thought each plan should be considered separately. The flight \nattendants were told at the time their pension plan might have been \nsaved, but now, sadly, it has been lumped in with all the pension plans \nat United and faces dramatic cuts.\n  Take a look at the ground employees, the mechanics, the people who \nfix the airplanes and maintain them and handle the bags. There are \n36,100 of them at United, both active and retired. They were promised \nbenefits of $4 billion. Their plan has only $1.3 billion in assets. So \nbased on this agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, \non average, they will lose about 25 to 27 percent of their pension \nbenefits. Retired members were promised an average benefit of $1,400 a \nmonth, and they could lose on average 19 percent of that promise.\n  While United was back in court on Wednesday asking for further \nconcessions from the unions on their contracts, the International \nAssociation of Machinists and Aerospace Workers announced that 94 \npercent of its United members had authorized a strike if their contract \nto work was cancelled. The machinists may feel they have no choice. \nThis, of course, would throw United's financial future into more \nuncertainty and jeopardy.\n  The United pilots have a pension plan that covers 14,100 people. The \npilots reached a deal with United last year to save much of their \nbenefit, but it is unclear how that will be affected by this new \nagreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Pilots have \ngenerous pensions. They fly some of the most demanding routes. They \nhave to be well trained and well skilled, and they, of course, are \nexamined constantly to make certain they have the skills to be pilots. \nThey would normally expect to see anywhere from $80,000 to $100,000 of \npension benefits after a lifetime of service to the airline, but if \nthis Government agency takes over, the maximum guarantee the Government \noffers is no more than $45,613 per person for those who retire at age \n65 in the year 2005. Keep in mind, pilots are forced to retire at age \n60 under rules governing pilots in America, so they would receive less \nthan $45,613. A Government takeover would cut most of their anticipated \npension benefits by as much as half.\n  Under the management plan, there are 42,700 participants encompassing \nadministrative and public contact employees. This is more difficult to \nquantify in terms of their pension loss. However, the machinists union, \nwhich represents some of these workers, says the ramp employees could \nlose up to 59 percent of their promised pensions, and public contact \nrepresentatives could lose up to 55 percent. These estimates take into \naccount the likelihood that United will offer a 401(k)-type plan once \nit emerges from bankruptcy. As we know, there are no guarantees with a \n401(k) any more than there is a guarantee that if one buys a mutual \nfund or a stock today that it will be worth more tomorrow. It is a \ngamble. It is a risk. It can play an important part in savings toward \nretirement, but it certainly does not provide any guaranteed benefits \nsuch as those that existed for employees who worked at United for \ndecades. It is a gamble that the President is contemplating to bring to \nSocial Security by privatizing Social Security: Let us move from \nguaranteed benefits in Social Security to the possibility that one will \ndo well in the stock market.\n  Well, if a person's pension is in trouble now, and it may not survive \nthe bankruptcy court, and the future of Social Security under the \nPresident's plan puts one at that same risk when it comes to \ninvestment, how can a person be certain they will ever be able to \nretire? How did we reach this point?\n  Pension promises that in hindsight may have been unrealistic were \nmade. The terrorism of 9/11 changed the market for airlines across \nAmerica. High fuel costs, increased competition from startup carriers \nall contributed to the losses that brought United into bankruptcy.\n  Last year, I supported a measure known as the Pension Funding Equity \nAct. We passed it hoping that we could temporarily use an alternative \ncalculation to lower pension liability payments and to make our way \nthrough this stormy situation. It did not work. Now United Airlines is \nnot alone in this predicament. Delta Airlines' pension plans are \nunderfunded by $5 billion, and it has threatened to file Chapter 11. \nNorthwest Airlines may be in trouble, too, according to equity \nresearchers at Bear Stearns. And we should believe that a lot of other \nairlines are looking with great interest at United Airlines and its \ncurrent situation.\n  Some people at American Airlines have said they want to keep their \npension plans, but they are concerned about the competitive advantage \nUnited will now have because it does not have to fund its own pensions.\n\n  After the airlines, retirement experts say the auto industry may be \nthe next to default on its defined benefit plans, leaving virtually no \ncompanies left that offer guaranteed retirement benefits. Let me give \nsome illustration of this.\n  Today's Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       By far, the industry accounting for the biggest portion of \n     underfunding is auto makers and automotive-parts companies. \n     The plans of those companies are $45 billion to $50 billion \n     shy of promises made to workers.\n       Delphi Corp., the No. 1 U.S. auto supplier, is struggling \n     with declining sales at its top customer and former parent, \n     General Motors Corp., plus big pension obligations and higher \n     raw-materials cost. Delphi has an unfunded pension liabili-ty \n     of $4.3 billion and $9.6 billion in retiree health-care \n     liabili-\n     ties. . . .\n\n  We are in the midst of debating the asbestos bill. It is interesting \non this asbestos bill the lineup of groups supporting it. That is \nanother outstanding liability for companies like General Motors. Many \nof us believe the trust fund in the asbestos bill is underfunded. We \nbelieve many major corporations with asbestos liability are anxious to \nsign up for the trust fund because they will be the benefactors more \nthan smaller and medium-sized corporations. So both General Motors and \nthe United Auto Workers have endorsed the asbestos bill.\n  Certainly, they have to look forward and say asbestos liability will \nthreaten the payment of health care benefits and retirement benefits to \nthe workers. So here there is a situation where victims of asbestos \nexposure may receive limited compensation under the trust fund plan \nthat has been endorsed by companies that expose them to asbestos \nbecause those companies want to limit their liability in the future \nbecause of such things as pension liabilities.\n  As we can see, this is a free-for-all and the losers ultimately are \ngoing to be either victims of asbestos exposure, in this instance that \nI used, or the workers themselves and we'll see retiree benefits \ndisappearing.\n  The United Airlines deal is the largest pension default in the \nhistory of the United States. Before it, Bethlehem Steel's $3.6 billion \npension default in 2002 set the record. There is a pattern, and the \npattern is that the workers get hurt the most.\n  I am offering legislation with Senator Kennedy and Congressman George \nMiller of California that would attempt to make it more difficult for \ncorporations to offer superior pension deals to their high-ranking \ndirectors and officers while the company is shifting its unfunded \npension liabilities to the Government or treating older workers \nunfairly during a conversion from a traditional defined benefit plan to \na cash balance plan.\n  Why in the name of fairness and justice should the officers of a \nbankrupt corporation be receiving superior pension deals and bonuses \nwhile the people who faithfully worked for that company for decades are \nbeing cut loose, their jobs eliminated, or the promised retirement \nbenefits are not paid? If there is any justice in this done, we should \ndemand of these corporate officers that they at least sacrifice to the \nsame level as the employees who are the victims of their mismanagement. \nRank-and-file workers should not be sent to the back of the line in \nbankruptcy court while executives get a free pass. Time and again, \nworkers have faced the back of the line in this country.\n\n[[Page S5051]]\n\n  Mr. President, you may remember an amendment I offered to the \nbankruptcy bill a few weeks ago. It was rejected overwhelmingly by the \nSenate. Let me tell you how radical this amendment was. It would have \nallowed bankruptcy courts to reach back and take the sweetheart deals \nthat were given to these officers and CEOs and put the money back into \nthe corporation to benefit the employees and the retirees.\n  I gave the example of several CEOs, including Ken Lay of Enron, who \nabuse their companies. You remember reading about Dennis Koslowski of \nTyco. This man had a unique lifestyle at the expense of his \ncorporation. He had the corporation buy his family a shower curtain. \nWell, what is wrong with that? Mr. Koslowski did some pretty shrewd \nshopping. He found a $30,000 shower curtain. That takes some doing. He \ntook the money out of the corporation, while it was facing financial \ntrouble, and then turned and said to the employees: Sorry, we are going \nto cut you loose. Retirees, we can't pay what we promised you, and \nshareholders, you lose, too. So for his shower curtain deal and a lot \nof other things, I think Mr. Koslowski should have been held \naccountable. He was in criminal court, but he certainly should be held \naccountable.\n  Bernie Ebbers, CEO of WorldCom, didn't piddle around with a shower \ncurtain; he took $408 million out of a company right before it went \ninto bankruptcy court. How can we sit around and say: That is OK, that \nis management; those guys are in the boardroom; don't worry about them; \nbut say to the worker out in the plant or to the retiree who is \ncounting on a retirement benefit plan or the shareholder: You are going \nto have to lose because Mr. Ebbers needed $408 million out of the \ncompany before he dumped it in bankruptcy? We should have recaptured \nthe assets he took out of the corporation before it went into \nbankruptcy. Maybe it would not have made the corporation solvent, but \nat least it would have been a fair allocation of the resources of that \ncorporation to the people who deserve the benefits from them in \nbankruptcy.\n  My amendment lost on a vote of 40 to 54. It was entirely too radical \nfor the Senate, to think that these CEOs would be held accountable for \ntheir conduct, that they would accept personal responsibility for what \nthey did. No way. Yet their workers and their retirees had to pay the \nprice. They were held responsible for this terrible mismanagement.\n  We also tried to raise the minimum wage during that bankruptcy \ndebate. I guess we are just wasting our time in this place. It has been \nover 8 years since we raised the minimum wage in this country. We were \ntold the head of a family who works 40 hours a week at a minimum wage \nand has two or three kids should not be able to lift his family above \npoverty. At a time when we have record productivity in our corporations \nand record corporate profits, why in the world can't we bring ourselves \nto make certain that workers in America get fair compensation? I don't \nunderstand it. If we value work and value families and value children, \nwhy aren't we paying a decent wage to many people who get up and go to \nwork every single day, sometimes two jobs a day? But, no, we can't pass \nthat here. That is too radical.\n  Now the President wants to privatize Social Security. He wants to \nmake sure that two of the sources of retirement security--Social \nSecurity and pensions--will no longer have guaranteed benefits. The \nthird source, of course--private savings--has never been guaranteed. \nPresident Bush says that is part of the ownership society. But, \nunfortunately, we are headed for a society for the owners, by the \nowners, and of the owners, where the workers are more vulnerable than \nthey have ever been in generations in America.\n  We ought to step back for a second. We ought to try to decide what is \nimportant in this society in which we live. Is it important for us to \nprotect the CEOs from their mismanagement of these companies? Is it \nimportant for us to say to Mr. Bernie Ebbers, You won't be held \naccountable for taking $408 million out of the corporation you dumped \nin bankruptcy? Is it important for us to make sure that people who make \nmore than $1 million a year get handsome tax cuts while we are deep in \ndebt as a nation, trying to come up with the money to fight a war, or \nis it more important for us to give fair compensation to people who go \nto work? Is it more important for us to step up and talk about \nguaranteeing and securing the pensions of hard-working people, who \nstayed with a job year after weary year because a husband says to his \nwife: Honey, I am going to hang in there for 2 years because I get my \nretirement. And look what happens. Months before you retire, or even \nmonths after you retire, they pull the rug out from under you.\n  This is a looming retirement security crisis. Baby boomers are set to \nretire in large numbers in just a few years. This country is not saving \nfor retirement. Our 401(k)s have taken a huge hit in the last 5 years. \nDefined benefit pension plans are almost extinct. Medicare is running a \nhuge deficit. And Social Security has been targeted for benefit cuts. \nThe three-legged stool of retirement security is looking a bit wobbly \ntoday.\n  Listen to what people around the country are saying about retirement \ninsecurity. An editorial in the Denver Post said this:\n\n       The retirement benefits offered by Social Security were \n     originally designed as one leg of the three-legged stool that \n     also included a worker's pension and a family's private \n     savings. But American families don't save like they used to, \n     and the national saving rate has been declining for the last \n     35 years. At the same time, American companies as a whole \n     have been cutting back--or in some cases defaulting--on \n     the pension coverage they once offered employees.\n\n  Listen to this letter to the Contra Costa Times in Walnut Creek, CA:\n\n       I am a retired 74-year-old woman and get Social Security \n     benefits, a private pension, payments from 401(k)s. Prior to \n     the dot-com disaster a few years ago, my 401(k) was worth \n     almost $300,000. It quickly dropped to half, [that value] and \n     is slowly recovering. If it were not for my pension and \n     Social Security, I would be very, very nervous about how I \n     would survive what remains of my life.\n\n  Another letter to the editor dated March 16 from a Shreveport, LA, \npaper:\n\n       In this time of corporate scandals, lost pensions, and \n     stagnant wages, working people need something that is \n     guaranteed and risk-free; that was always the genius of \n     Social Security. . . . Social Security does need improvement, \n     but that should mean ensuring benefits, not putting them on a \n     Wall Street roller coaster. There are plenty of opportunities \n     to invest in the stock market. Congress and the president \n     should strengthen Social Security to make sure working people \n     get the benefits we've paid for. We deserve it.\n\n  We owe it to our workers and their families to take an honest look at \nthese issues and come up with some real solutions. We need to take a \nlook at the Pension Fairness and Full Disclosure Act. We need to \nstrengthen Social Security, not weaken it by privatizing it. We should \nencourage people to save for retirement, create incentives, tax \nincentives and other payroll incentives, for people to save. And we \nshould encourage companies to pay what they promised workers and not \nallow them to get away with underfunding their pension plans.\n  As part of the reform of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, \npremiums are necessarily going up, and the companies that underfund \ntheir pension plan will have to pay more into it so the guarantee of \nthis Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is worth something. We need \nto make sure that this agency meets its obligation to all American \nworkers.\n  Today, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is $23 billion in \ndebt. Who is going to bail it out? At a time when we are going to give \n$32 billion in tax cuts next year to people making over $1 million a \nyear--$32 billion to people making over $1 million a year--at a time \nwhen we are facing record deficits, at a time when we are concerned \nabout the survival of Medicare and Medicaid, it is clearly time for \nsome thoughtful leadership in this country.\n  What happened with United Airlines, sadly, is a symptom of a real \nproblem that is undermining the retirement security of every American \nfamily. We have been diverted from looking at the broader retirement \nsecurity issues by the administration's Social Security privatization \nproposal. It is time to look at how to address the entire retirement \nincome equation and provide more security, not less.\n  There was a time in America when we valued work, we valued workers, \nwe valued the worker's family, and we said: We are going to provide you \nwith basic dignity. You get up and go to work every single day, you set \na good\n\n[[Page S5052]]\n\nexample for your family, you contribute to your company and your \ncommunity, and America will be a better place and we will stand behind \nyou. We will make certain that when the day comes for retirement, no \nmatter what happens, Social Security will be there to provide some \nbasic safety net for you and your family. We will watch the workplace \nfor you, too. We will do our best to make sure it is safe so you are \nnot injured while you are working on the job. If you are injured, we \nwill see you are compensated fairly.\n\n  When it comes to the wage you earn, we hope you will do better than \nthe minimum wage, but we will guarantee there will be a minimum wage in \nAmerica so there will be some basic dignity in work and the hardest \nworking people in America, trying to raise a family, can get by.\n  It was part of a social contract. It was America as a family, coming \ntogether. We were protecting our own. We were committed to our own. But \nthere is a new attitude in Washington. You can feel it. That attitude \nof the so-called ``ownership'' society says, remember this, we are all \nin this alone. We do not come together to help one another, to protect \none another, to care about one another. That is abandoning a \nfundamental principle in America.\n  We believe in the goodness of the people who live in this country. We \nbelieve in the fairness of our economic system. We believe the \nGovernment should stand for justice in a system where unjust things are \noccurring. But if you look at what happens in the Senate and the House \nday in and day out, time and time again, one wonders if we walked away \nfrom that commitment. We wonder if we are not dealing with some \nsituation of noble savages being turned loose in a wilderness with the \nhope they survive. I hope it does not come to that.\n  Sadly, for tens of thousands of United Airline employees who just a \nfew years ago were glorying in the fact that they work for one of the \nbest airlines in the world, the bottom is falling out. The pension they \nworked for, for a life, is disappearing. They have taken wage cuts. The \nfuture is totally uncertain.\n  There are no guarantees in a free market system. There are winners \nand losers. But when you have made a promise to an employee, shouldn't \nyou be held to that promise? Shouldn't you have a social contract, a \nbinding contract, that the promise won't be broken?\n  I am afraid it has been broken here. This pillar of family security \nin America is crumbling. What will your Congress do to deal with it?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to make a few comments about the \nSAFETEA legislation. I thank the managers of the bill for working with \nus in trying to address some of the concerns I had about the prior \nlegislation from last session.\n  As I stood here over a year ago when we debated this bill, I spoke \nvery critically of that legislation and the damage that legislation did \nto Pennsylvania. Thanks to the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator \nfrom Missouri, in particular, we have been able to address some of what \nI consider to be inequities in this legislation.\n  The point I made a year ago was that one of the major reasons for a \nFederal tax on gasoline in a Federal highway bill was the idea of \npromoting interstate commerce. Originally, the interstate system was \ncertainly put in place for military purposes--at least ostensibly for \nmilitary purposes--to move things around the country in a national \nemergency.\n  Obviously, the more pedestrian reason, if you will--probably that is \na bad word to use when we talk about highways, but nevertheless, the \nreason that is most often used is because it is for interstate \ncommerce, to move goods around the country, to move people around the \ncountry, for travel and tourism, a whole host of other reasons.\n  When you look at why the Federal Government does that, you have to \nstep back and say transportation is a State function. Every State in \nthe country has a transportation department. Why do we need a Federal \ntransportation department? We need it because we have to make sure the \ngoods that are produced in New Jersey can get to Ohio to Texas, or the \ngoods produced in California can get to Georgia.\n  The fact is it is important for us to be connected. If there are \nsituations where States are in financial difficulty and they let their \nroads degrade, particularly the major interstates--for example, my \nState is occupied increasingly with traffic that does not stop in \nPennsylvania--there would be much more of an impetus if you were a \nlocal legislator to invest money on roads which Pennsylvanians used and \ninvest a lot less money on roads that are used by folks out of State.\n\n  So we put together a Federal tax system, a gas tax, as well as \nFederal transportation legislation, to promote on the highway side--the \ntransit is another piece, but we will talk about highways for a \nmoment--to promote interstate commerce.\n  So we have a situation where we have States that shoulder a large \nburden when it comes to that interstate commerce and we have other \nStates that are the great beneficiaries as to the burden those States \nshoulder in getting a lot of what is referred to as passthrough \ntraffic. That is traffic that does not stop in your State, does not \nbenefit your State economically, to speak of, but, in the case \ncertainly of trucks, beats the heck out of your roads. So you are in a \nsense carrying the load for States that are the economic beneficiaries, \nwhether they are the originator of the freight or the destination of \nthe freight, whether you are a State that is a passthrough State for \ntravel and tourism. Those are the States you want to pay particular \nattention to. Again, the nature of the program is to make sure we have \na seamless highway system, that we have good interstate commerce.\n  The reason I came to the floor last year was to point out that \nPennsylvania is a State that certainly shoulders the lion's share or \ncertainly major share of this passthrough traffic. We have in \nPennsylvania about as many interstates as any State in the country. I \nthink there are three States that have more interstate miles. Texas, \nCalifornia and Illinois are the only three that have more interstate \nmiles than Pennsylvania. We have 22 interstates in Pennsylvania. \nActually, another one is under construction.\n  There are only four States that have a higher number of ton-miles \nthan Pennsylvania. Again, they are much bigger States than little old \nPennsylvania, Texas, California, Ohio and Illinois.\n  I will show a chart that shows the importance of interstate commerce \nand what Pennsylvania has to deal with. First, the statistic I throw at \nyou, 47 percent of the trucks that go through Pennsylvania do not stop \nin Pennsylvania. They do not originate there and are not destined for \nthere. We get a lot of traffic from the New England States--New Jersey, \nNew England--that goes through Pennsylvania to get out West or comes \ndown through Pennsylvania to get down to the South. These lines are the \ntraffic that goes through Pennsylvania that does not stop, coming from \nway out here in Seattle, and they go way up to Maine and lots of points \nin between.\n  We see the resulting effect on the load of traffic in Pennsylvania. \nThis is the Pennsylvania Turnpike, the big thick black line. That is \nmore than 80 million tons of traffic passing through Pennsylvania on \nthis one road. We see several others that have between 60 and 80 \nmillion tons of truck traffic, heavy truck traffic. We have heard in \nthe Senate the vehicles that do the most damage to the highways are \nyour heavy trucks.\n  Yes, we are in an industrial area. We have a lot of heavy steel, \ncoal, and lots of other products that travel through our State. They do \nan enormous amount of damage. You throw on top of that the mountainous \nterrain we have in Pennsylvania, the numerous bridges. We have several \nthousand bridges that are in disrepair. We have lots of bridges, we \nhave lots of mountains, we have a lot of freezing and thawing in \nPennsylvania which wreaks havoc on the roads. So we have a lot of \nproblems we have to deal with compounded by this heavy through traffic.\n  When I came to the Senate last year and said I was going to oppose \nthe bill in the Senate--because here is a State, I argue, that is one \nof the poster children for a Federal Highway System\n\n[[Page S5053]]\n\nthat focuses money on States such as Pennsylvania because it carries \nsuch a heavy burden for the rest of the country without any direct \neconomic benefit. This was a State, logically, given the topography, \nthe climate, and the congestion and traffic we bear, it would be a \nState that should do well under a Federal formula. Certainly as Members \nhave said to me in the past, we have.\n  However, under the bill last year, we actually became a donor State. \nWe became a State that was going to subsidize the rest of the country. \nHere we are in Pennsylvania with this heavy burden of truck traffic. We \nrank fifth in the country in ton miles in Pennsylvania. Here is little \nPennsylvania.\n  (Mr. ISAKSON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, you have States such as Texas and States \nout West and many other States that are bigger geographically, such as \nGeorgia. Yet Pennsylvania is fifth in the country in the ton miles our \nroads have to sustain. So what we are asking for is a little bit of \nequity.\n  I see the chairman is in the Chamber. We have gotten equity, at least \nsome degree of equity. Everybody always thinks they should always get \nmore equity, but we have gotten some degree of equity in this bill. We \nare not, under this bill, a donor State. Being one I think was \nunderserved. But we still, thanks to the chairman's amendment, get only \na 15-percent increase in the amount of funding from the last bill to \nthis bill. That is lower than any other State in the country. Actually, \nwe tie with two other States as getting the lowest rate of increase. So \nwe are a donee State, but we are declining as far as the amount of \nmoney.\n  I would argue that is inappropriate given what I have laid out here \nand the purpose of a Federal highway bill. But we have done better. And \nwe have done well enough that I, as you saw from the votes I have cast \non this bill, have supported this legislation and will certainly \nsupport passage of this legislation.\n  We have a serious problem in Pennsylvania. We have a lot of bad \nroads. Twenty-seven percent of our roads in Pennsylvania are rated by \nthe Bureau of Transportation Statistics as mediocre to poor. I see the \nPresiding Officer from Georgia. We have 27.1 percent of our roads rated \nmediocre to poor. Georgia has .2 percent rated mediocre to poor. \nGeorgia, under this bill, receives a 30-percent increase. We receive a \n15-percent increase. The Senator from Georgia just happens to be in the \nChair, and I just wanted to point that out because it is a pretty big \ncontrast.\n  The Senator from Georgia has fought hard for his State, and he is a \ndonor State, so I know he believes he deserves more. He has fought very \nhard and, obviously, very effectively to make sure his State has been \ntreated, in his mind, and I am sure in the minds of the people of \nGeorgia, more equitably.\n  But I would make the argument that States around the perimeter of \nAmerica really do benefit from States such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nIndiana, and the States through the middle part of the country that \nhave to carry all this traffic to and from the border regions. That is \nwhy, if you look at the formula, most of the States that do not do well \nunder these formulas are border States. Again, the reason is they do \nnot have to carry the passthrough traffic, particularly the heavy \ntraffic that we in Pennsylvania have to carry. In addition, they do not \nhave the weather problems and the topography problems and a whole host \nof other problems that we have to deal with. Forty-two percent of our \nbridges in Pennsylvania are structurally deficient or obsolete. We have \nserious problems.\n  So when I came here last year and opposed the bill last year, I did \nso because of the concern I had about the way my State was being \ntreated. I am grateful, again, to the chairman for his effort to bring \nPennsylvania into some semblance of equity. I thank him for that. I \nthank the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Shelby, for the \nwork he has done with me on the Banking Committee on the transit piece. \nTransit is a very important piece of the transportation infrastructure \nof Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, for example, 70 percent of the cost \nof our transit system is provided for by the State. There are seven \nStates that do not contribute anything to their transit systems. \nTwenty-eight States contribute less than what the Federal Government \ncontributes to their transit systems.\n  So we made a major contribution in Pennsylvania to transit. I thank \nthe chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Shelby, for making sure \nPennsylvania is treated fairly under this legislation.\n  One final point I would like to make. I see my colleague from Ohio is \nhere. He probably can make a similar argument about the passthrough \ntraffic that goes through Ohio.\n  I thank the chairman for his effort on the Job Access and Reverse \nCommute Program. There is a 73-percent increase over TEA-21. This is a \npiece of legislation that we were able to get into TEA-21. It has been \na very important program for a lot of our innercities to be able to get \nto jobs out in the suburban ring where job development is certainly \nfaster than it is in the core innercities. This transportation program \nhas proven, at least in my State--in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia in \nparticular, and Harrisburg and other places--to be a very important \nproject, to be able to increase the number of employed in the core \nurban areas with better quality jobs, and the availability of a better \nlife. So I thank the chairman for his increase, and I certainly hope he \nwill hold that increase in conference.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me just respond to some of the things \nthe Senator is talking about. First of all, Senator Santorum has done a \ngreat job leaning on us and talking to us and is largely responsible \nfor the fact that we made a major change in this bill. This change \nincreased the amount that will be going to Pennsylvania by $208 \nmillion.\n  But I would like to say this: When you talk about the miles of \nsubstandard roads and highways, Oklahoma has a larger percentage that \nare substandard than Pennsylvania. I am not saying it because I am \nproud of it, because I have not been doing my job, I suppose, but in \nterms of the percentage of substandard bridges, Oklahoma is \nconsiderably higher than Pennsylvania.\n  Now, what it does point out, though, is the necessity for this bill \nbecause we are going to try to correct all these things. We will not be \nable to do it in 1 year, but by the end of this authorization period, \nwe are going to look a lot better than we are now--but not if we have \nto continue to operate on extensions.\n  So I appreciate the comments. And I do not disagree with anything \nthat the Senator says. I believe when you sit down with people and talk \nabout a formula--it is interesting, the previous Presiding Officer is \nfrom Texas. I am not sure he agreed with everything that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania said. But it is a very difficult thing to do.\n  So I appreciate the cooperation the Senator has given and the \ninfluence he has put on this legislation which has helped us make this \na better bill. I appreciate that very much.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Ohio, I know you \nare attempting to get the floor for something other than the bill, but \nwe do have someone coming down with an amendment. Would it be \npermissible, if you were to use the floor, that when someone comes with \nan amendment, you would yield to them, or is that something you would \nbe uncomfortable with?\n  Mr. DeWINE. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I will.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I have a tribute to a soldier who was killed, and it will \ntake no more than 10 minutes. So once I start, I would not want to \nstop. But I will not start until you want me to start.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I understand. But you would attempt to do it in 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Yes. I will certainly do it in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator could wait until you are finished.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I could wait to start until later if you want.\n  Mr. INHOFE. No, I suggest you go ahead. I say to the Senator, after \nthe Senator gave his eloquent talk about\n\n[[Page S5054]]\n\nthe safety problems that are out there throughout America right now, I \ncame to the floor and talked about the safety core provisions that are \nin this bill, that if we are on an extension, as opposed to passing a \nbill, people are going to die. This is a life-or-death issue. I think \nyou brought that out very forcefully, and I know it comes from the \nheart.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I appreciate what my colleague has done. \nThe Senator from Oklahoma is absolutely correct that if this bill is \npassed, these provisions will be in there, as well as a lot of new \nconstruction that will save lives as well.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Very good. I yield the floor.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding the junior Senator \nfrom Virginia has an amendment he wishes to offer. It affects the \ncommerce title of the bill. I ask if Senator Stevens would like to come \ndown, since this is the commerce title of the bill, while he offers an \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 611\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 611.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendments are \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself, and Mr. \n     Ensign, proposes an amendment numbered 611.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To modify the eligibility requirements for States to receive \n       a grant under section 405 of title 49, United States Code)\n\n       Strike section 7216(a) of the bill and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) In General.--Section 405 is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``Sec. 405. Safety belt performance grants\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Transportation shall \n     award grants to States in accordance with the provisions of \n     this section to encourage the use of safety belts in \n     passenger motor vehicles.\n       ``(b) Grants for Safety Belt Use.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall make a single grant \n     to each State that has a State safety belt use rate for the \n     immediately preceding calendar year of 85 percent or more, as \n     measured by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis.\n       ``(2) Amount.--The amount of a grant available to a State \n     in fiscal year 2006 or in a subsequent fiscal year under \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection is equal to 500 percent of \n     the amount apportioned to the State for fiscal year 2003 \n     under section 402(c).\n       ``(3) Shortfall.--If the total amount of grants provided \n     for by this subsection for a fiscal year exceeds the amount \n     of funds available for such grants for that fiscal year, then \n     the Secretary shall make grants under this subsection to \n     States in the order in which the State's safety belt use rate \n     was 85 percent or more for 2 consecutive calendar years, as \n     measured by the National Center for Statistics and Analysis.\n       ``(4) Catch-up grants.--The Secretary shall award a grant \n     to any State eligible for a grant under this subsection that \n     did not receive a grant for a fiscal year because its safety \n     belt use rate is 85 percent or more for the calendar year \n     preceding such next fiscal year.\n       ``(c) Allocation of Unused Grant Funds.--The Secretary \n     shall award additional grants under this section from any \n     amounts available for grants under this section that, as of \n     July 1, 2009, are neither obligated nor expended.

Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment I have \noffered, along with Senator Ensign of Nevada, is to make sure safety \nbelt incentive grants are awarded based on a State's seatbelt use rate, \nnot based on a prescriptive mandate from the Federal Government that a \nState must enact a primary seatbelt law to receive Federal funds.\n  I have long opposed Federal dictates, whether direct or indirect, on \nStates to enact a primary seatbelt law. This brand of nanny government \nprecludes American adults from making basic decisions for themselves \nand could hamper law enforcement's ability to effectively patrol the \nstreets and highways for more serious and egregious offenses. It is \ngenerally a waste of scarce time and resources for local police \nofficers to pull over an adult and write a ticket to fine someone who \nwas, theoretically, potentially harming himself or herself by not \nwearing a seatbelt. Our citizens would be better served if a law \nenforcement officer, rather than writing that ticket, because someone \nwas otherwise driving safely down the road, was actually finding \nsomeone who is weaving down that same stretch of road as a drunk \ndriver, clearly a danger to themselves but more importantly to others. \nLaw enforcement resources are not unlimited. I believe police officers \nhave more pressing needs than craning their necks to make sure every \nlicensed driver on the road has a buckled seatbelt.\n  This is not an issue of interstate commerce. This is not a civil \nrights issue. This is not in the U.S. Constitution. This is an issue of \nenforcement of seatbelt laws, and what laws a State might want to have \nis and has long been under the jurisdiction of the people of the \nStates. I don't believe that nanny mandates such as this initiative \nshould come from government. But if it is going to come from a \ngovernment, it ought to be coming from a State government, certainly \nnot the U.S. Congress. State legislators provide a much closer \nrepresentation of the views and beliefs of their respective \nconstituencies in this country. I am a firm believer that the laws of a \nparticular State in matters such as this reflect the principles and \nphilosophies under which the citizens in that State wish to be \ngoverned.\n  One can see from this chart a minority of States have enacted primary \nseatbelt laws. The ones in red are the 21 States that have primary \nenforcement of seatbelt laws. Simple math tells you that 29 States do \nnot have a primary enforcement of seatbelt laws. In fact, New Hampshire \ndoesn't even have secondary enforcement of seatbelt laws. I surmise \nthat this issue has been considered by all of the States' legislatures \nin the past.\n  In our general assembly in Virginia--the world's oldest legislative \nbody in the Western World, started in 1619--they have debated the \nbenefits of a primary seatbelt statute numerous times and have \nconsistently rejected such a law in our Commonwealth of Virginia. In \nfact, during the debate in the Virginia House of Delegates, it was \nstrongly argued that primary seatbelt laws can contribute to racial \nprofiling.\n\n[[Page S5055]]\n\n  In early 2003, Delegate Kenneth Melvin of Portsmouth, VA, voiced his \nopposition to a primary seatbelt law, stating:\n\n       I know what happens when you are stopped by police as a \n     black man in this country, and in Virginia in particular.\n\n  He then explained how his oldest son had been pulled over by police \nnumerous times for no apparent reason.\n  Incidents like this might not happen in every State and may be \nspecific to certain jurisdictions in Virginia, but it is the \nfundamental reason for us to leave such decisions to the people in the \nStates. The repercussions of such Federal mandates or pressure can have \ndifferent effects in each State.\n  Given that the majority of the States have declined primary safety \nbelt laws, it seems inappropriate for the Federal Government to devise \na grant program that essentially compels the States to enact them or \nlose Federal gas tax dollars that they paid into the Federal highway \ntrust fund.\n  The underlying bill's Occupant Protection Incentive Grant Program, I \nsuppose, is well-meaning officiousness, but instead of providing grants \nbased on obtaining a goal to increase use rates, the safety title \nrequires the States to enact a primary seatbelt law to receive these \nFederal funds which, of course, have come from the people in the States \nwho paid Federal gas taxes.\n\n  The proponents of this provision will no doubt argue that the program \nis not discriminatory, not an effort to coerce States without primary \nseatbelt laws to enact such laws. However, the 90-percent use rate \nrequired in this bill would make it extremely difficult for a vast \nmajority of the States to qualify for grant funding. According to the \nNational Center of Statistics and Analysis, only seven States had a \nsafety belt use rate of 90 percent or higher in 2004.\n  I understand there are studies that indicate that primary seatbelt \nlaws are most likely to yield increased use rates. However, if States \nwithout primary seatbelt laws are able to attain a comparable or higher \nuse rate to those with such laws, it is fundamentally unfair for the \nFederal Government to withhold grant funding that has been provided by \nall road-using taxpayers.\n  My amendment would revise the Occupant Protection Incentive Grant \nProgram to base grant awards on an 85-percent safety belt use rate. \nInstead of compelling States to enact primary seatbelt laws, grants \nwould be awarded based solely on seatbelt use attainment. There are a \nvariety of ways that States may encourage people to use seatbelts.\n  It is difficult for me to understand the logic of an incentive \nprogram that would provide Virginia, with its high safety belt use \nrate, far less funding than a State with a far lower seatbelt use rate \nand a primary seatbelt law. Yet that is entirely possible under this \nbill if a State with a lower use rate has enacted a primary seatbelt \nlaw. They could have a lower rate than the State that doesn't have such \na law and receive funding, while the State with higher usage does not.\n  If the goal is to attain higher safety belt use rates, incentive \ngrants should be awarded based on a specific goal. In our amendment, it \nis an 85-percent safety belt use rate. This proposal is similar to the \none already included in the House version of this legislation.\n  My proposal is a much more equitable way to provide incentives and \nreward States for increasing safety belt use rates. It makes the \nproposed program fair by making requirements the same for all States \nbut does not compel States to enact primary seatbelt laws. Again, the \ngoal of our amendment is simple and clear: attain higher seatbelt use \nrates based on achievement, not on an artificial mandate from the \nFederal Government.\n  States are looking for the greatest flexibility on how to use Federal \ntransportation dollars that we send back to them. Some may decide that \nincreasing capacity can best serve their citizens by helping alleviate \ntraffic congestion and improving the safety of a particular roadway. My \namendment would allow these funds to be used for everything from \nintersection improvements, pavement and shoulder widening, installation \nof rumble strips or warning devices, improving skid resistance, \nimprovements to pedestrian or bicyclist safety, railway, highway \ncrossing safety, traffic calming, the elimination of roadside \nobstacles, improving highway signage, and pavement marking. They can \nuse it for installing priority control systems for emergency vehicles \nthat signal intersections. They could use it for installing traffic \ncontrol or warning devices at locations with high accident potential, \nor increasing road or lane capacity.\n  It has been noted multiple times throughout this debate that our \nhighways are not being maintained and actually require greater funding \nthan the underlying bill provides or authorizes. This amendment would \nprovide the States some additional flexibility to address road and lane \ncapacity needs if they so choose.\n  We all agree that wearing a seatbelt increases safety for drivers, \nand the policy should be to try to promote increased safety belt use \nrates.\n  My amendment does not change that purpose. However, I do not believe \nit is the role of the Federal Government to force States to enact such \nlaws that are traditionally considered in the State legislatures. The \nStates may have many ways, such as advertising, to encourage greater \nseatbelt usage.\n  My amendment rewards States equally for reaching an 85-percent safety \nbelt use rate, but does not seek to force them into only one solution \nprescribed by the officious nannies in Washington, which would be a \nprimary enforcement seatbelt law.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the laws in their home State. \nTwenty-one States have such a law, 29 do not. Determine whether you \nbelieve this Federal Government incentive plan should reward States \nthat have high usage or whether it should be used to promote a certain \nmeddling nanny philosophy of this body that tells State legislatures \nand the people in the States what to do.\n  My amendment would ensure that the occupant protection incentive \ngrant funding is awarded fairly and is done so based on attainment of \ngoals. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, very briefly, the Democratic leader and I \nhave a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of amendments I \nsend to the desk be the only remaining first-degree amendments in \norder, other than a managers' amendment to be cleared by both managers \nand both leaders; provided further, that they be subject to second-\ndegree amendments that have been filed in accordance with rule XXII; I \nfurther ask consent that any amendment from the list must be offered by \n4 p.m. on Monday, May 16; provided further, that when the Senate \nresumes consideration of the bill on Tuesday, May 17, all time be \nexpired under rule XXII and the Senate proceed to votes in relation to \nthe pending amendments in the order offered, and that following \ndisposition of the above listed amendments, the Senate proceed to a \nvote on the Inhofe substitute amendment, as amended, that the cloture \nvote on the underlying bill be vitiated, and the Senate then proceed to \na vote on passage of the bill, with no intervening action or debate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. To the leader through the Chair, it is my understanding we \nwill have a vote Monday night, and it will be one of the amendments on \nthe list; is that right?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is correct. We will have one \namendment, possibly two, Monday night, and the remainder of these votes \nwill be stacked, on Tuesday, in the order that was just spelled out.\n  Mr. REID. Further, Mr. President, we have been on this bill 2 weeks, \nbut that is somewhat misleading because we have had so many other \nissues that have interrupted the discussion of this bill. The work on \nthis bill is good. I compliment the managers and the others. Not only \ndo we have these managers on the bill, but there are many committees \nthat have jurisdiction on this bill. It is a very complicated bill \njurisdictionwise. It is a big bill moneywise. The managers have to be \ncomplimented for doing this.\n  I believe this is what we can accomplish in the Senate. We have only \nspent\n\n[[Page S5056]]\n\na few days on this bill. I repeat, this is a remarkable piece of work \nwe have done. I hope we can continue doing the work for the people of \nAmerica as needs to be done. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I second what the Democratic leader said in \nterms of both sides working together on a bill that has taken a \ntremendous amount of work. We spent several days on the bill and had \nplenty of opportunity over the last 2 weeks for everybody to come \nforward.\n  To clarify for the benefit of our colleagues, with this agreement in \nplace, we can announce there will be no further votes this evening. \nTomorrow we will resume the bill, and Senators will be able to offer \namendments from the list. No rollcall votes will occur on those \namendments during Friday's session.\n  As we just stated, on Monday, Senators will have an opportunity until \n4 p.m. to offer amendments. As we discussed, there will be at least \none, but possibly two votes. We will be voting Monday evening on at \nleast one of the highway amendments. Therefore, Senators can expect the \nnext vote to be at 5:30 p.m. Monday. We will then complete our work on \nthe bill Tuesday morning. The managers will work over the course of \nFriday and Monday to further limit the number of amendments that will \nrequire votes.\n  I thank our colleagues, and I thank the chairman and ranking member \nfor their tremendous work, their patience in bringing this bill \nforward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The list of amendments is as follows:\n\n       Germane amendments intended to be offered:\n       Carper: #638, #723.\n       Dodd: #732 Teen Drivers.\n       Durbin: #734 Fuel savings reporting; #669 Bicycling.\n       Feingold: #695 Buy American; #676 Volunteer mileage.\n       Feinstein: #591 Alameda Corridor East; #633 Toll Roads.\n       Lautenberg: #619 Drunk driving; #639 Big Trucks.\n       Schumer: #674 Transit Benefits.\n       Wyden: #690 Hours of use exemption.\n       Landrieu: #620 Corridor.\n       Kerry: #680 Ferry boats.\n       Post Cloture Amendments\n       Sessions #646.\n       McCain #719.\n       McCain #720.\n       Craig #616.\n       Domenici #659.\n       Bond #631.\n       Bond #658.\n       Warner #686\n       Ensign #636\n       Chambliss #603.\n       Alexander #733.\n       Snowe #706.\n       Lott #583.\n       Lott #667.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 611\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this evening to oppose the \namendment my colleague from Virginia offered. With all due respect to \nmy good friend from Virginia, I do so because I believe the bill, as \ncurrently written, is a good one, as I said earlier today. I believe \nthe language in the bill on primary seatbelt usage that has been \nwritten by Senator Lott will, in fact, save lives.\n  In this country every year, we lose over 40,000 Americans in highway \ndeaths, 40,000 Americans who are killed in auto fatalities. This bill \nis aimed at, in many different respects, trying to reduce the number of \nAmericans who die by building better roads, by dealing with dangerous \nintersections, and some of the safety provisions we have already talked \nabout in this bill.\n  If you talk to anyone who is a highway safety expert or if you talk \nto the real experts who are the men and women who patrol our highways \nevery day--in Ohio it is the Ohio State Highway Patrol or it might be \nthe local sheriff's department, State troopers, whatever they are \ncalled in your local jurisdiction--I believe the experts who have \nlooked at and studied this issue will tell you that the use of primary \nseatbelt laws clearly saves lives.\n  Why is that? It is pretty simple and pretty basic. The reason is \nthis: Of all the things we can do to save lives, the easiest and \nsimplest is to increase the number of people in this country who buckle \nup, who put on a seatbelt. Every car that is manufactured in this \ncountry today has a seatbelt. It is not adding any new equipment. It is \ngetting people to put on their seatbelts. It is a question of getting \npeople to use equipment that is already in the car.\n  If people use seatbelts, they are safer and the auto fatalities go \ndown. The highway safety experts, the people who have studied this \nissue, will tell you when the usage of seatbelts goes up, the auto \nfatalities go down. It is that simple.\n  The other thing we know is States that have passed primary seatbelt \nlaws have seen the use of seatbelts dramatically go up. In Ohio, for \nexample, we do not have that law, unfortunately, and we are hovering at \nabout 75-percent use. We are probably never going to get beyond 75-\npercent. We are not going to get to 80 or 85 or 90 percent unless we \nhave a primary seatbelt law.\n  If a State gets a primary seatbelt law, that usage will go up. It \nwill go up 5, 10, 15 percent, and when you see that happen, the number \nof lives will be saved.\n  In Ohio--I am using my home State as an example, but you can \nextrapolate these figures from Ohio to any other State in the Union--in \nOhio, we estimate if we had a primary seatbelt law and our usage went \nfrom 75 percent up to, say, 90 percent, we would save 100 lives per \nyear. That is a lot of people. We would save lives every year. Whatever \nthe figure, we are going to save lives.\n  So this is a very simple provision Senator Lott and the managers have \nincluded in this bill. What the amendment of my good friend from \nVirginia would do is basically take that out.\n  Now, for my colleagues who worry about the Federal Government being \noppressive and using the stick, this is not a stick approach. This is a \ncarrot approach. This is extra incentive to the State to do it. It will \nsave lives. There are very few times when one can come to this floor \nand know that their vote will save lives.\n  When we get to the point where we vote on this, a vote to retain this \nlanguage in this bill will, in fact, save lives because States will \nenact it; the usage of seatbelts will go up, and when the usage of \nseatbelts goes up, lives will be saved. It is pretty simple.\n  So I urge my colleagues to defeat the Allen amendment and to keep \nthis language in the bill.\n  One last comment. My colleague has talked in his speech about the \nhighway patrol and the police have other things to do. Yes, they have \nother things to do. The point of a primary seatbelt law is akin to most \nother laws. It is a deterrent. That is why we have speed laws. That is \nwhy we have every other kind of laws. It is a deterrent, and the \ndeterrent changes behavior. Because that law is on the books, because \npeople know they have to have it, because they know they can be pulled \nover for not having it, they will put it on and usage will simply go \nup. It works. It has worked in State after State, and lives will be \nsaved.\n  So I urge my colleagues to keep this in and to defeat the amendment \nof my colleague from Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the \nsafety belt provisions in the Inhofe substitute, and to urge my \ncolleagues to reject the amendment offered by my colleague, Senator \nAllen.\n  The Commerce Committee's provisions to provide incentives to States \nwhich increase the use of seatbelts is essential to improving the \nsafety of the driving public.\n  Increasing seatbelt usage is the hallmark of the administration's \nproposals to the Congress, and it is the cornerstone of the Commerce \nCommittee's title to this bill.\n  The administration does not support the amendment before us and \nSecretary Mineta has written that, ``President Bush and I believe that \nincreasing safety belt usage rates is the single most effective means \nto decrease highway fatalities and injuries.''\n  The facts are undeniable as the Secretary of Transportation states: \n``Empirical evidence shows that the surest way for a State to increase \nsafety belt usage is through the passage of a primary safety belt \nlaw.''\n  The administration's bill sets as our national goal a seatbelt use \nrate of 90 percent. That should be our minimum standard, but under the \nAllen amendment it would be weakened.\n  In a letter I received yesterday from Dr. Jeff Runge, administrator \nof the\n\n[[Page S5057]]\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, he writes in reference \nto the seatbelt grants program that ``no other proposal in SAFETEA will \ndo more to improve safety than this bipartisan proposal.''\n  I commend Chairman Stevens, Senator Lott, and Ranking Member Inouye \nfor their strong leadership in continuing a critically needed safety \nbelt incentive grant program. It was my privilege to be directly \ninvolved in the drafting of TEA-21 in 1998. For the first time, TEA-21 \nincluded a significant, new incentive based program to increase the \nseatbelt use rate in this Nation.\n  At that time, the national average for seatbelt usage was \napproximately 67 percent. Some states, particularly those with primary \nseatbelt laws, were achieving belt use rates far above the national \naverage, and they saw the immediate benefits of fewer highway deaths \nand injuries.\n  Before the TEA-21 program, other States, without primary seatbelt \nlaws, had belt use rates much lower than the national average.\n  The Safety Belt Incentive Grant Program in TEA-21 provided \napproximately $600 million to States which improved their belt use \nrates. We have seen improvements in the number of people wearing \nseatbelts as a result of this program. I commend the Commerce Committee \nfor their leadership in advancing a program that will take us even \nfurther in helping States to get people to buckle up.\n  Today, the average seatbelt use rate has improved significantly. \nThere remains, however, great disparities between the States in their \nseatbelt usage. It is clear that States with primary seatbelt laws \nachieve far higher seatbelt use rates than States without primary \nseatbelt laws. For this reason, the Commerce Committee provides \nsignificant funding to States that enact primary seatbelt laws.\n  The Commerce Committee program, like the administration's proposal \nand the amendment I offered last year, sets as our national policy a \ngoal that States reach a 90-percent seatbelt use rate. This important \nprovision recognizes that the most effective tool to improve seatbelt \nusage is by enacting a primary seatbelt law.\n  Wearing seatbelts is a critical public health and safety issue. As \nmany have said, wearing a seatbelt is the most single most important \nact we can take to prevent deaths and injuries on our highways.\n  For the first time in a decade, highway deaths are on the rise. In \n2004, nearly 43,000 children and adults died as a result of automobile \ncrashes. Over half of these deaths involved people who were not wearing \ntheir seatbelt.\n  I find that astonishing. There is no other fact that is more \ncompelling that should convince us to take action.\n  If for no other reason to support this amendment, we must protect our \nNation's youth. Today, automobile crashes are the leading cause of \ndeath for Americans age 2 to 34.\n  These tragic statistics are reversible, and the provisions approved \nby the Commerce Committee are critical to reducing traffic deaths.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the provisions in the bill to provide \nfinancial incentives to States to increase seatbelt usage to 90 percent \nor to enact a primary seatbelt law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Allen amendment, \nand I will repeat what Senator Warner had to say:\n\n       I rise today to strongly support the safety belt provisions \n     in the Inhofe substitute and to urge my colleagues to reject \n     the amendment offered by my colleague Senator Allen.\n\n  I thought that would be a pretty interesting statement to put into \nthe Record at this point.\n  I remember, though, Senator Warner did a lot of work on this subject \na couple of years ago. He has been involved in Transportation bills, \nhighway bills, but I remember he had an amendment that would actually, \nin effect, provide sanctions if one did not have seatbelts. I voted \nagainst that because I do not think that is the way to get States such \nas mine to do something that could be very important in terms of \nsafety.\n  Before he leaves the floor, I want to also commend Senator DeWine for \nhis work on these safety issues. In the bill last year, he had a lot of \nprovisions that he worked with Senator McCain and others on to get them \nto include in the Commerce portion of the highway bill. This is an area \nwhere he has worked, he feels passionately about it and he came back \nthis year and said we want to work together.\n  I think if my colleagues will look at what we put in the safety \nprovisions from the Commerce Committee, from the Surface Transportation \nand Merchant Marine Subcommittee that I chair, now a part of the \nsubstitute, they will be pleased with the safety provisions.\n  This is a key part of the highways and transportation in our country. \nIf we just look at the pavement, if we just look at the jobs, if we \njust look at economic development, we will be missing a big part of the \nequation, and that is safety and lives that can be saved or lost \ndepending on what we do.\n  Senator Stevens, Senator Inouye, and I met with people on all sides \nof this equation: highway people, safety advocates, State \nrepresentatives, labor, the entire mix, and we developed these \nprovisions very carefully. So I want to thank Senator DeWine for his \neffort.\n  Because I have done that, and because I have worked on this issue, I \nfeel very strongly in opposition to the amendment offered by Senator \nAllen. Usually, Senator Allen and I would be together on something like \nthis, but my opposition this time is very simple and that is we need \npeople to use seatbelts; they save lives.\n  I come from a State that is one of the lowest users of seatbelts in \nthe Nation--63 percent. I am one of those who has been slow to come to \nthe usage of seatbelts, but I guarantee you my kids know how important \nthey are. They will not let me crank the car up until everybody is \nbuckled in, including especially my grandchildren.\n  Then, as I have gotten into it more and more, the statistics are \nclear that these seatbelts will make a difference. In 2003, about \n17,000 people killed in motor vehicle crashes were not buckled up, and \nnearly 500 of those deaths were children. Would it absolutely have \nsaved them if they had been buckled up? Maybe not. But even if it had \nbeen just a few hundred, and it probably was more like thousands, that \nmakes a huge difference. Many of those 17,000 deaths were preventable.\n  A passenger wearing a seatbelt is 45 percent less likely to be killed \nwhen involved in an accident. For light trucks such as SUVs, the figure \nis higher. The risk of fatal injury is reduced by 60 percent. Traffic \nsafety experts nationwide agree that the most effective short-term way \nof reducing traffic fatalities is to increase the seatbelt use.\n  Getting people to change their driving habits is a major challenge \nthat requires more than just airing public service announcements or \ndistributing safety materials. Over the years, States have tried many \ndifferent ways to increase seatbelt usage. Experience has shown the \nmost effective means to increase seatbelt use is to enact the primary \nseatbelt law.\n  In fact, each percentage point increase in seatbelt use saves about \n270 additional lives. If every State in the country enacted the primary \nseatbelt law, more than 1,200 lives would be saved every single year.\n  Today, in the 22 jurisdictions--21 States and the District of \nColumbia--that have primary enforcement laws, the average seatbelt use \nrate is 11 points higher than in States without this primary seatbelt \nlaw. I want to emphasize my State does not have it. I have talked to \nState officials. I want to encourage the State to do that, and this \nprovision will do that. I will explain that a little bit more in a \nmoment.\n  To give an example of how powerful an effect this will have, consider \nthe recent experience in the State of Illinois which passed a primary \nseatbelt law in just 2003. In just one year after Illinois passed a \nprimary seatbelt enforcement law, the seatbelt use rate jumped from 74 \npercent to 80 percent. Increases in seatbelt use produced real results. \nIn Washington State, traffic fatalities declined by 9 percent in the \nfirst year after passing a primary seatbelt law. Yet there are still 29 \nStates that have not passed it. This grant program will provide \nincentives for those States to take the steps needed to save lives.\n\n[[Page S5058]]\n\n  It also rewards States that are able to achieve a 90-percent seatbelt \nuse rate without a primary seatbelt enforcement law. States that have \nalready done it but show movement and get to 90 percent, there is a \nreward, an incentive, for them to do that. What we are really worried \nabout is those 29 States that have not done it that are down in the \n60--or even less--percent use of seatbelts. This program rewards the \nStates that are able to achieve that 90 percent.\n  Senator Allen's amendment says that unless a State gets 85 percent, \nthey do not get any of the incentives. In my State, it is 63 percent, \nand we are not going to get to 85 percent for many years to come. We \nwill not ever reach the percentage or get the incentives that would \nencourage us to do it.\n  The seatbelt performance grants offer States the flexibility to use \nmuch of the funds on highway safety infrastructure projects. That is \nthe most important safety provision we could possibly pass: Better \nroads, wider roads, more lanes, more bridges, safer bridges. That is \nthe ultimate safety provision. Seatbelts and other things that can be \ndone, the construction of vehicles, make a difference too.\n  The flexibility funding allows States to identify and address the \ngreatest highway safety hazard. They can improve dangerous \nintersections, enhance railroad signage or redesign dangerous stretches \nof road. Combining a primary seatbelt enforcement law with addressing \nhighway safety hazards is a win-win situation.\n  More States would reap the benefit under the Senate Commerce \nprovision than under the Allen amendment. Today, only 14 States have an \n85-percent seatbelt use rate required to qualify for the Allen \namendment.\n  The Allen amendment is also a budget buster. If all States were to \nenact primary seatbelt laws, the cost of the Commerce Committee bill \nwould be $597 million. If all States were to meet 85-percent belt use \nunder the Allen amendment, it would cost $778 million. The additional \n$181 million needed to fund the amendment would have to come out of the \nhighway trust fund.\n  We thought about this carefully. We listened to administration \nofficials. It is very clear it is the view of the administration, the \nposition of the administration, that we need to encourage greater use \nof seatbelts. We need States to pass this primary seatbelt law. It will \nsave lives, and I believe the Allen amendment will undermine a very \nstrong part of this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues, when we do take this back up, to look at this \nvery carefully. We will vote on it next week and you will have a chance \nto think it through. It is not about, Do I get a little more this way \nthan that way as a State; we are talking about lives here. We are \ntalking about lives, and a life in Georgia is as important as a life in \nMississippi or Virginia or any State in the Nation.\n  I feel strongly about this. By the way, one of the reasons why I feel \nstrongly, I believe, is I am among the converted. I didn't just get \nhere years ago; I moved gradually toward this. Finally, the statistics, \nthe evidence, and the deaths are too much weight for me to reject, or \nnot accept. This is a way to get a significant increase in my State, \nand States all across the country, in seatbelt usage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I, too, rise and join my colleague from \nMississippi in his very eloquent remarks, and my colleague from Ohio.\n  I know the Senator from Illinois is waiting to speak in a few \nmoments.\n  I rise in opposition to the Allen amendment. I understand the \nintentions, but I think the statistics and the numbers and the reality \nmake it clear that the American people are better off under the \nprovisions as they currently exist in the bill. More States benefit \nfrom the Senate Commerce primary belt law provision. There are 19 \nStates currently that have primary seatbelt laws on their books and \nthey will qualify for funding immediately. Only 14 States have an 85-\npercent seatbelt use rate, according to the 2004 numbers. That is what \nyou need to qualify under the terms of this amendment. So more people \nwould benefit and be rewarded for having the primary seatbelt law.\n  I think the provisions of the Commerce Committee's bill guarantee \nfunding if the State does one thing, and that is either have or pass a \nprimary belt law. Under the amendment we are talking about right now, a \nState has no certainty that any action it takes will increase belt use \nthat will result in 85-percent or higher rate use.\n  This amendment would, if enacted, abandon a very important goal, and \nthat is, for several years the Department of Transportation has set a \ngoal of 90-percent seatbelt usage. The amendment in question would set \na goal basically at 85 percent. I have a concern. Knowing human nature \nand the way things work sometimes, I think folks might give up at 85 \npercent and never try to reach that 90 percent. So I think the DOT \npolicy is a good one. I think it is designed to save lives. It is a \ncommonsense approach. As Senator Lott said a few moments ago, States \nthat have a primary seatbelt law on average show the increase in \nseatbelt usage by 11 percentage points. He tried to drive that home a \nfew moments ago. I think that is a very powerful statistic.\n\n  Primary seatbelt laws are also the fastest and the cheapest way to \nsave lives. The NHTSA administrator, Jeff Runge, M.D., said of the \nprovisions in the current bill that they would save more lives, do it \nfaster and cheaper than any other highway safety proposal Congress is \nlikely to consider this decade.\n  So the experts agree, the numbers agree, and last, let me say, the \nsafety groups agree. These are the people out there every single day \nfighting for better laws and more safe vehicles, safer roads, et \ncetera. They agree. The proposal in the current bill, not in the \namendment but in the bill, is supported by the National Safe Kids \nCampaign, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the Automotive Coalition for \nInsurance Association, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Mazda, \nthe Automotive Occupants Restraint Council, the Traffic Safety, the \nNational Safety Council, the American Insurance Association. It \nincentivizes States to pass these primary seatbelt laws. The experts \nagree the way to save lives on America's highways is to try to pass \nthese seatbelt laws.\n  I, like Senator Lott, do not have a primary seatbelt law in my State. \nTypically I think States should have the rights to make these \ndecisions, and certainly every State does. But what we do is give a \nbonus, an extra incentive for States to consider, State legislators, \nGovernors, et cetera, to consider passing these type of laws because it \nwill benefit their citizens and benefits the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment when it comes up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, like my distinguished colleagues from \nArkansas and from Mississippi, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my distinguished colleague from Virginia. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to preserve the seatbelt program as it is written in the \nTransportation reauthorization bill.\n  This provision in the underlying bill gives States that pass \nprimarily seatbelt laws a one-time incentive grant from that State's \nannual traffic safety grant apportionment. The purpose of this \nincentive is to encourage States to take specific action, passage of a \nprimary seatbelt law that will save more lives.\n  As it so happens, my State of Illinois passed a primary seatbelt law \nin response to this incentive. I know we did it in response to these \nincentives because I was the chief sponsor of passage of the primary \nseatbelt law.\n  The same thing happened in Delaware. The same thing happened in \nTennessee. You know what. It works, and it works faster and cheaper \nthan any other method, in terms of ensuring that people wear safety \nbelts and save lives.\n  It is amazing we have to keep saying this, but seatbelts save lives \nand primary seatbelt laws save more lives. The National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration predicts if every State enacted primary seatbelt \nlaws, more than 1,000 lives could be saved each year and 17,000 \ninjuries could be prevented. Seatbelt use is 11 percentage points \nhigher in States with primary enforcement laws than in those States \nwhere laws provide for secondary enforcement. And States changing from\n\n[[Page S5059]]\n\nsecondary to primary enforcement have seen 10 to 15 percentage point \nincreases in usage.\n  Beyond the facts and statistics, this is an issue that makes sense. \nWe should not have to just hope people wear seatbelts, just as we \nshould not have to hope they obey speed limits or hope they stop at red \nlights. We should do what we can to make sure people will wear \nseatbelts that will keep them alive. We teach our children to wear \nseatbelts when they get into a car and we all hope they listen to mom \nand dad and do it when we are not there, but wouldn't we feel better if \nwe knew our laws in our communities were helping to make that happen? \nDoesn't it makes sense for the Federal Government to maintain a \nconsistent message on seatbelt use, not through a mandate but through a \nsimple incentive?\n  The National Safe Kids Campaign thinks so. Mothers Against Drunk \nDrivers thinks so. They endorse and prefer the Federal incentive as \nwritten in the underlying bill.\n  Finally, a Federal incentive is also a Federal commitment. When the \nFederal Government makes a commitment and States respond accordingly, \nthen the Federal Government needs to keep its word. One of the points \nthat was raised by Senator Allen in sponsoring this amendment was that, \nin Virginia at least, there seems to be some concern that primary \nseatbelt enforcement would result potentially in an increase in racial \nprofiling in Virginia.\n  As somebody whose community on the south side of Chicago is fairly \nfamiliar with racial profiling, and who hears anecdotes each day from \nAfrican-American drivers who believe they may have been profiled, I am \ncertainly sensitive to Senator Allen's point. As it turns out, though, \npart of the way we were able to solve this in Illinois was to couple a \nprimary seatbelt enforcement law with a racial profiling law that would \nensure we were keeping track as to how traffic enforcement was taking \nplace and to make certain it was being done in a nondiscriminatory \nfashion.\n  This was the bargain that was struck at the local level: the notion \nthat we would have a primary seatbelt law enforced; we would also have \na data collection bill that would allow us to track and make sure our \ntraffic laws are being applied in a nondiscriminatory fashion.\n  That deal that was struck in Illinois was premised on the notion that \nwe would be getting these Federal incentives. It is not appropriate for \nthe Federal Government to now pull the rug out from under States such \nas Illinois that have done the right thing. It is appropriate, instead, \nfor us to keep our word, maintain our commitments, and make sure we \ncontinue to incentivize a law that everybody knows, in fact, saves the \nlives of our citizens.\n  I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 674 to Amendment No. 605\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 674, which I \nbelieve is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 674.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To increase the transit pass and van pooling benefit to $200)\n\n       On page 628, line 23, strike ``$155'' and insert ``$155 \n     ($170 for 2007, $185 for 2008 and $200 for 2009 and \n     thereafter)''.\n       On page 629, line 5, strike ``2008'' and insert ``2009''.\n       On page 629, line 7, strike ``2007'' and insert ``2008''.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will be brief. This amendment raises \nthe tax-free mass transit benefit from $155 to $200 per month by the \nend of the life of the Transportation bill. I, first, thank my \ncolleagues on the Finance Committee, Mr. Grassley and Mr. Baucus, for \nraising the amount to $155. That is already in the bill. What this \namendment does is raise the remainder over the course of the bill to \n$200. What it will do is equalize the benefit offered by employers for \ntransit expenses with the current benefit offered for parking expenses.\n  I understand that Senators Baucus and Grassley are working with the \nBudget Committee to get this amendment approved. So I hope we will not \nhave to vote on it or debate it much longer than this. I greatly \nappreciate their efforts.\n  Basically, we give people a $200 deduction when they drive to work. \nIt is obviously a business expense if they have to pay for parking, but \nmass transit has always been discriminated against. We do not give \npeople that deduction for mass transit. This makes it equal. It does \nnot favor one, does not favor the other. It does not take from highways \nto give to mass transit. It is a win-win-win.\n  Now, mass transit ridership is at an all-time high nationwide. It \ncontinues to rise in New York and across the country. For millions of \ntransit riders, this increase will save them hundreds of dollars every \nyear. Raising the transit benefit will simultaneously reduce traffic, \ncongestion, and smog while saving commuters in New York and across the \ncountry hundreds of dollars every year.\n  The existing disparity between the two benefit levels has also \ncreated a financial incentive for employees to drive to and from work \nalone rather than utilize transit or a vanpool. The amendment \neliminates this disparity. The transit benefit provides a low-cost way \nto get more cars off the road. In the New York metropolitan area alone, \ncommuters save over $150 million, thanks to the transit benefit. \nEmployers have saved significantly as well, over $35 million. And that \namount can be multiplied for benefits throughout the country.\n  By taking cars off the road, increasing the transit benefit is sound \nenvironmentally as well. It reduces emissions, which leads to cleaner \nair, and cuts gasoline use across the board.\n  I hope we can support this good tax cut unanimously.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have a very real difficulty with this \nbill. I think there is a strong desire by most Members of this body to \nincrease the amount of money that is set aside for our road \ninfrastructure. The bill, in fact, does increase that. We had a number \nat which the President said he wanted us to stay. We increased that \nnumber nearly $11 billion. We started at $284 billion. Now the number \nis $295 billion.\n  The best numbers that I can get from the Budget Committee have \nconvinced me that the sad truth is we have $11 billion in this bill \nover the budget spending cap that we agreed to. It is the first real \nbill that has come up since we passed the budget agreement. So we are \nalready in violation of it. They say there are offsets, but some of \nthose offsets are not realistic. I think most everybody knows it.\n  They are projecting things are going to happen in conference, and \nthat it is not going to be a pleasant conference because the President \nhas made clear he will veto a bill that is not within his budget. We \nare facing a real problem.\n  So I have thought what we ought to do in this Senate, in this \nCongress, is what real people do when they have to face serious \nfinancial decisions. They have to accept the fact they cannot do \neverything. I know Senator Inhofe has worked so incredibly hard on this \nbill. My admiration for him is unlimited. I know how strongly he wants \nto see the road portion of this bill be as strong as it possibly can. \nAnd I agree. People travel on highways every day. An improved \ninfrastructure can be a positive difference for our communities and \nNation. That is why I try to support everything I can and to be as \ngenerous as possible in the road construction account.\n  I will not go into the details tonight, but my amendment will look at \nless critical parts of this bill, including the mass transit title, and \nother portions of the bill, and it will ask how many increases we can \nsustain in those accounts. By reducing the increases a little bit, by \nan amount that would allow an increase to occur--not cutting those \naccounts but not having an increase as big as has been proposed--we can \nproduce a bill that increases our funding for our basic infrastructure, \nis faithful to the budget numbers this Congress adopted, and will be \nsigned into law--not vetoed by the President.\n  If we get to conference without something like this, what we are \ngoing to see is that the amount of money set aside for our basic \nhighway infrastructure is going to be cut in conference because the \noffsets are not going to all be accepted.\n  So let me say again, we are heading to conference with an increase \nover the budget that is supposed to be offset. Some of those offsets \nare not going to be approved. And I suspect our basic road \ninfrastructure amount that we now have in the bill will not be \nsustained and will be reduced.\n  My amendment will allow us to sustain those increases that have been \nproposed and that we desire. It will allow us to stay within the \nbudget. It will fund this by reducing the increases in other \nnoncritical programs, but still allowing them to increase--not cutting \nthem.\n  I think that is what responsible people ought to do. That is what the \namendment I have offered does. We will talk about it in more detail. I \nthank Senator Inhofe for his leadership on this issue and on so many \nothers. I know he has worked hard. They probably have agreements on how \nthis thing has to go, but I believe the amendment I have offered will \nbe helpful to achieving the goal most of us share.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves, let me just \nclarify something. It is a very rare occasion that the good Senator \nfrom Alabama and I disagree on anything. It just doesn't happen. In \nthis particular case, this is the exception. Let me kind of outline how \nI think the system works. I don't chair the Finance Committee. I don't \nchair the Budget Committee. I do not serve on either one of them. I do \nchair the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  When we put together the bill--and this particular bill has been 3 \nyears in the making--it is very similar to what we had last year except \nit is a lower funding level which should satisfy, to a greater degree, \nthe Senator from Alabama. But when we come up with a bill, the \nprocedure is to go to the Finance Committee. We did that, and we have \nseveral Finance provisions in there. Senators Grassley and Baucus spent \na long time. While people keep saying the offsets are not realistic, \nthey could be right, but the ones who can properly evaluate the offsets \nare the ones who proposed the offsets, and that is the job of the \nFinance Committee.\n  I want to say this because the Senator from Alabama and I are ranked \nas two of the most conservative Members of the Senate. I have said \noften there are two areas where conservatives spend money; one is \nnational defense and the other is infrastructure. That is what we are \nsupposed to be doing here. I wish to clarify that I will be opposing \nthe amendment because I believe the Finance Committee has done their \njob. I have heard both the ranking member and the chairman talk about \nthis, and they have convinced me that they have done their work. We \nwill have to wait and see.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. He is \na great leader in the Senate. I admire his work on this committee and \nhis leadership as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee on \nwhich I serve with him. I don't dispute that the Joint Tax Committee \nhas said the offsets the Finance Committee has proposed, if adopted, \nmight meet the needs of this increase.\n  I understand some of those proposed offsets probably will not have \nsupport in the House. I would like to see the Senator's goal of \nspending more money on our road infrastructure and transportation \nsystem that serves the commercial transportation needs of all the \nproducts that we eat, buy, and utilize daily--that are shipped from \ntrucks on highways all over America--I would like to see that \nguaranteed. I am afraid if we go the way we are now, we will not be \nable to hold the full increase that has been proposed when we get to \nconference. But if we would face up to the question and set some \npriorities and choose between some of the things that are in this bill \nthat are less fundamental and some of the things that are desirable--\nthings we would like to do but we really don't have to do as much as \nothers--and reduce some of the increases proposed for those programs \nand move that into the fundamental infrastructure for highways, I would \nfeel better about it.\n  I think the Senator is not really in disagreement too much with that. \nBut when you move a piece of legislation as he has, it requires a lot \nof cooperation and partnership.\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Yes, I agree. We hear all the time in this body and all \nrepresentative bodies about what is desirable. It reminds me of the guy \nwho went to the department store, and this beautiful, young, voluptuous \nsaleslady came up to him and she said: Sir, what is your desire? And he \nsaid: Well, my ``desire'' is to pick you up after work, go out to \ndinner and drink some champagne and make mad, passionate love to you, \nbut I ``need'' a pair of socks.\n  We have to distinguish between desire and need, and I think it is a \ndifficult thing to do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is all I am suggesting. Let's go on and make that \nupfront, and maybe we will be able to hold this full increase for our \nhighway funding.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendments Nos. 583, 631, and 733 en bloc. I ask unanimous consent that \namendments Nos. 631 and 733 be modified with the changes at the desk \nand agreed to en bloc. The amendments have been cleared by the managers \non both sides of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me withhold on the agreement until we get final \nclearance.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the record, I withdraw my unanimous \nconsent request. There was a misunderstanding that was involved. We are \nworking on that, and we hope we can get the package agreed to later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The request is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, before I yield to the Senator from Alaska, \nI first wish to say how helpful she has been. I know the needs they \nhave in Alaska are unique. She has been very helpful and a great member \nof our committee. I thank her publicly very much for that.\n  I think we are making progress now. We have gotten the amendments \nunder control so we can stay on the schedule that has been outlined by \nthe unanimous consent agreement that has been accepted on both sides.\n  I express my appreciation for everyone cooperating.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for the kind words \nhe said and for the substantial work he has done in the committee to \nmove us forward in a manner I think is fair, good, sound, and it is \ngoing to work. I am so pleased we are at this point where we will \nshortly be moving a transportation bill through this body.\n  I think I speak for all my constituents when I urge this body to move \nforward on the highway bill. Every State needs it, but truly I believe \nnone need it more than my State of Alaska, and the chairman has \nreferenced our somewhat unique needs.\n  For most of us traveling from one place to another, it means asking \nyourself whether you walk, drive, take a bus, take a train, or an \nairplane. That is life in the 21st century. But in much of Alaska, \nAmericans are still facing issues that are similar to what we faced in \nthe 19th century. In much of Alaska, whether you drive is not a \nquestion without meaning. Instead, the question is, What time of year \nis it? Is it the time of year I will be using a snowmobile or going by \nboat?\n  I suppose there are probably some of my colleagues who may be tired \nof hearing that Alaska is unique with unique problems that require \ndifferent solutions, but that does not make it any less true, nor does \nit make Americans living in Alaska any less deserving than Americans \nliving somewhere else.\n  Yes, Alaska, in fact, does have the highest rate of return from the \nhighway trust fund. We are the donee State that benefits the most, but \nit is because we are so far behind the other States in transportation \nneeds. I can tell my colleagues, it is a safe bet we would gladly see \nour position on the donee State listing change if it meant we had the \nroads to generate more gas tax revenues for the highway trust fund.\n  To any Alaskan, it is a remarkable and frustrating experience to hear \nthe donor States complain that a dime or so of their Federal gas tax \ndollar actually goes to serve a Federal purpose--a highway system that \nunites and strengthens our Nation--and that tax does not come right \nback home.\n  It is also remarkable and again somewhat frustrating to hear that \nroads in many States are in disrepair and more money is needed to \nrepair them. Yes, they are, and, yes, it is, but at least those States \nhave roads. With roads, they gain the ability to move goods and share \nservices. With that ability, they gain the ability to support private \nsector businesses. With private sector businesses, they provide jobs, \nand with jobs, they attract new residents, are able to build more \nschools, offer opportunities, create more wealth. You get the picture. \nThe wealth is shared with the entire country. We have seen that process \nwork.\n  The funding received by the Appalachian Commission for Road Building \nhas proven this works, and history has proven over and over that \nreliable, inexpensive transportation is not the result of prosperity, \nbut it is the cause for prosperity.\n  The highway bill and the highway trust fund which supports it exist \nfor one reason: because Congress recognized that reliable \ntransportation is critical to our national well-being and to the well-\nbeing of our individual citizens. This is no less true in the farthest, \nmost remote parts of Alaska than it is in the center of Manhattan. That \nis why this bill contains provisions to allow the Denali Commission to \nconstruct roads between remote communities in Alaska.\n  This provision is based on a bill I had proposed in 2003 which would \nstreamline the process of bringing Alaska's transportation system into \nthe modern age. The same provision, as amended by the Senate action \nlast year, will also help improve roads within Alaska's many Native \nvillages, some of which still have only the roughest of trails from one \npart of town to another.\n  Frankly, the authorization in the bill for this purpose is simply not \nenough because Alaska has so many years of neglect to catch up on. I am \nsensitive, however, to the fiscal realities, and I am deeply grateful \nfor the support of those who have helped us get this far. We must \nrecognize this is not just an investment in Alaska today, but it is an \ninvestment in Alaska's tomorrow.\n  For the record, I would also prefer to have a separate system and \nsignificantly more money dedicated to our Native village transportation \nneeds. They have been badly neglected. In fact, they have been \nshamefully neglected by the Bureau of Indian Affairs reservation roads \nsystem which is supposed to provide funding for Native American needs. \nAlaska Native villages have been ignored, their road miles have been \nuncounted, and money has been funneled into other areas that already \nhave sophisticated road systems.\n  The bill also contains money to continue the reconstruction of the \nAlaska highway. I want to comment on this in the hope of dispelling \nsome of the perennial confusion about it. Despite the name, the \nmultiyear project to pave and improve the Alaska highway, also known as \nthe Alaska-Canada, or the Alcan highway, is not an Alaska\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\nproject. It is not an earmark for Alaska. It is not even in Alaska. It \nis a national project, one that was triggered by national defense needs \nand mandated by treaty between the United States and Canada.\n  As a treaty obligation, it is not to be discarded lightly. It is \nunfortunate that some apparently have trouble reading beyond the name \nand that it has fallen to Alaskans to stand up for the word of honor of \nthe United States to fund this project, but that is just the way it has \nbeen. Here again, I am grateful for the support of Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Bond, and others who have recognized that this is not just a \nparochial project but one of significance to the entire Nation and one \nfor which the Nation has given its word.\n  As I mentioned, we have unique needs, unique challenges, and I renew \nan invitation to all of my colleagues: Come up and visit. Come up and \nsee the State, see for yourself the conditions we have.\n  I had an opportunity just yesterday to demonstrate that when we talk \nabout Alaska's road system, we use that term lightly. It is not a \nsystem; it is a road up and there is a road down and a little connecter \nin between the two, and that is what we have. When we talk about where \nour roads stretch from, if we were to superimpose Alaska over the rest \nof the lower 48 States, we would be going from Minnesota down to \nFlorida and across over into California. The area we cover is huge.\n  So, again, come up and see the conditions that we have. I would be \nhappy to arrange a trip for any Member of the body, no matter where \nthey stand on the issue, and I am not just talking about transportation \nissues. We will take the Members up and show them ANWR. We will show \nthem the whole State. I am proud of the State, and I am proud of what \nwe have done to preserve and protect our resources while we still build \na vital economy. I would be happy to show my colleagues how we are \ndealing with some of our unique situations and problems.\n  One such unique situation has been the fact that it is literally \nimpossible to build roads between some communities, even in long-\nsettled areas like in southeastern Alaska where I was born, where a \ncombination of rugged terrain and the separation of the islands have \nmade other solutions necessary. One solution for the area in the \nsoutheast was the establishment of the Alaska Marine Highway System, \nwhich builds on a core fleet of large oceangoing vessels in service as \nferries. It is the only highway possible between communities such as \nKetchikan, Petersburg, Wrangell, Sitka, Juneau, our State capital, and \nmany other smaller communities. It is part of the National Highway \nSystem.\n  If the definition of a highway is a facility used by trucks and cars \nmoving from one community to another, this is, indeed, a highway. In \nfact, it is one that is considerably less expensive than other options \nsuch as tunneling, like we have up in Boston, the ``Big Dig,'' or the \ncombination of bridges and tunnels we see around here.\n  The last highway bill, TEA-21, contained provisions to fund ferries \nand ferry terminals in addition to funding received through the \nNational Highway System. I am pleased to say that this bill does as \nwell. In fact, ferry system assistance in this bill is even broader and \nwill help even more States operating ferry systems to do a better job \nfor their citizens.\n  Now, I have been informed that the finance portion of the bill \nincludes provisions based on two bills which I have previously offered. \nOne of these provisions corrects an inequity imposed on air passengers \nwho live in rural areas where, again, they are unconnected by road and \nthey are forced when they are traveling to fly to a larger airport \nwhere they can catch a plane to get somewhere, to reach their final \ndestination. All passengers currently pay a segment fee for air travel, \nbut these rural residents I am talking about are basically forced to \npay twice, while passengers who live within driving distance of a \nlarger airport only pay once.\n  The second measure which I just referenced affects seaplane operators \nwho are not using FAA facilities but currently must pay excise taxes \nand fees intended solely to support such facilities. This is also an \ninequity, and my measure will ensure that only those receiving benefits \nare asked to pay for them.\n  In addition, it is my understanding that the committee has also \nincluded a measure intended to ensure that taxes and fees intended for \naircraft carrying passengers from point to point is not incorrectly \napplied to flight-seeing operations. Senator Inouye has taken the lead \non this matter, but it is worth noting that it has significant support \namong my constituents in Alaska, and I am pleased to see it included.\n  Finally, let me note that I understand that the Commerce Committee \ntitle includes my proposal to establish State grants for motorcycle \nrider education. As my colleagues may be aware, motorcycle ridership is \nincreasing all the time, and with it the number of motorcycle accidents \nhas also been rising, particularly among the new riders. It is not \nnecessarily the young riders but riders of any age. It is the latter \nthat my proposal addresses. I believe firmly that the best way to \nprevent injuries is to prevent accidents, and training is the only way \nto accomplish that goal.\n  I have worked closely with the Motorcycle Riders Foundation and State \nmotorcycle education administrators to develop this proposal. All too \noften, we will see new riders, both young and old, simply climb on and \nhope that they are going to learn by experience. Better training has \nbeen shown to drastically reduce the number of accidents suffered by \nnew riders during the critical period in which their learning curve is \nthe steepest and they are most at risk.\n  From the national perspective, this highway bill is a good bill. It \nis not perfect, but few things are. I would prefer to see more \nstreamlining and permitting processes for highway projects. I would \nlike to see more flexibility for States. I would like to see a bill \nwith the funding level that we approved last year. The leaders of each \none of our key committees have done yeoman's work--and again, I want to \ncommend the chairman--on phenomenally difficult issues. I believe at \nthe end of the day we have before us a good bill, the best bill \npossible. I pledge my support for it and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska named a list of \nthings she would have preferred to see in the bill. As I thought of \neach one of them, I agree with each one. Of course, the Presiding \nOfficer is also a member of the committee, and we know there are a lot \nof diverse needs in States. It is not a perfect bill. There are a lot \nof things I would rather have in it, but it is a consensus. It was \ngive-and-take, and that is the way the system is supposed to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5062-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

Mr. President, in 1988 Leslie Satcher picked up her \nbelongings and left her home in Paris, TX, bound for Nashville. With a \nmeager $100 in her pocket, she abandoned all that she had known in her \nyoung life, and headed to the Music City driven by her dream of being a \ncountry-music star.\n  Almost 2 decades later, that dream is a reality.\n  Today, Leslie Satcher is one of Nashville's most sought after song-\nwriters. She has emerged as a glowing success under one of the world's \nbrightest country-music spotlights.\n  At her core, Leslie Satcher is a woman of humble ambition. Her work \nis shaped by unyielding faith and limitless passion for music. Critics \ndescribe her writing as ``emotionally persuasive, yet understated and \nartful.'' Indeed, she has found her success not by abandoning her homey \nroots but by embracing them.\n  Her lyrics are laced with plain spoken yet insightful observations \nabout love and life. And despite her tremendous success, she has always \nremained true to her creative vision, never losing hold of the simple \njoys of writing and singing music.\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\n  Leslie has come a long way since her first venture into recording at \nthe ``hear-your-own-voice'' attraction on Music Row and in front of \naudiences at the Bluebird Cafe. The Dallas Morning News has described \nher as ``one of the most in-demand tunesmiths in Music City.'' And her \npersonal, painful and poignant compositions have been covered by a \nwide-range of artists including Reba McEntire, George Jones, Vince \nGill, and Randy Travis.\n  Most recently she has concentrated her efforts on not only penning \nsome of today's top hits, but singing some of them, too. In fact, she's \nin Washington, DC this week to give a special performance to honor our \nNation's injured troops at Walter Reed Army Hospital.\n  Mr. President, Leslie Satcher is a self-made music success story.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to pay tribute to a \nyoung Ohioan who lost his life while serving our Nation in Iraq. PFC \nMichael Barkey was killed on July 7, 2004, when enemy fire caused the \nvehicle he was riding in to overturn. He was 22 years of age.\n  I had the opportunity to meet Michael's family and to talk to them \nabout their extraordinary son. They shared their memories with me--\nmemories of Michael lighting up the room with his infectious smile and \ncausing others to laugh at his antics. An editorial in the Canton \nRepository from July 9, 2004 says it best:\n\n       Michael Barkey's family and friends have a long time of \n     mourning ahead of them. But it is a testament to his vibrant \n     personality and strong character that as the news of his \n     death began to sink in, their memories of him made the people \n     who loved him smile and laugh.\n\n  Michael's vibrant personality, touched the lives of all who had the \nprivilege of knowing him. As the fourth of six children of Hal and \nJulie Barkey, Michael learned at a young age that he loved to make \npeople laugh and that he was good at it. When his older sister Jennifer \nhad her first child, eight year-old Michael quipped that since he was \nan uncle at 8, he would be a grandma before age 30. His mother Julie \ncould only laugh at her young son when he flubbed his words. She liked \nto call him a ham.\n  Every member of Michael's family has fond memories of him. Growing \nup, Michael and his brother John loved to wrestle each other and--\nthough he wouldn't do it for anyone else--sister, Therese, remembers \nhow Michael would dance around for hours to entertain her and her \nfriends. Youngest brother Tony recalls a time when Michael popped out \nhis false tooth in church to shock a small child. Cousin Joe Mitchell \nremembers when they went to Myrtle Beach together and saw an attractive \nwoman. Michael and another man argued for so long about who would speak \nto her first that she walked away. All who met Michael were touched by \nhis witty humor.\n  At Canal Fulton Northwest High School, Michael excelled both \nacademically and athletically. He loved to play basketball and \nfootball. High school football coach, Vic Whiting, remembered that \nafter their last game, Michael--then a senior--couldn't bring himself \nto take off his uniform. High school friends said that ``Mikey,'' as \nthey called him, was always the center of attention and a natural \nleader.\n  After high school, Michael enlisted in the National Guard so that he \ncould pay his way through the University of Akron, where he earned an \nassociate's degree in fire technology. His dream was to become a \nfirefighter, but his unit was called to go to Iraq. Michael believed \nstrongly that he was needed to secure freedom for others, that he was \nneeded to help the Iraqi people.\n  Answering the call of duty was not new in the Barkey family. \nMichael's grandfather, Edmund, served in Europe during WWII; father, \nHal, is a Navy veteran of the Vietnam war; brother, Todd served in \nOperation Desert Storm; and brother, John, was an Air Force firefighter \nstationed in Qatar during Operation Enduring Freedom. Michael was proud \nto follow in what had become a family tradition.\n  Michael and the rest of the 1484th Transportation Company trained in \nIndiana before being sent to Kuwait and then on to Iraq. Michael had \nbeen in the National Guard for 4 years. Soon Michael developed the \nreputation of being able to lighten the mood despite the chaos around \nthem. Captain Curtis Brown, commander of the Company said that Michael \nwas ``a remarkable young man who had the gift of making you see the \ngood in a bad situation. He was a master of the gift of laughter.''\n  One young soldier, in particular, can attest to that. Specialist \nJesse Hensel was Michael's bunkmate and best friend. The two were \ninseparable--whether they were lounging in their room or lifting \nweights. Jesse and Michael were like brothers and they argued like \nbrothers. The only thing they agreed on was that Jesse was better \nlooking and Michael was the better dancer.\n  Michael knew that his family worried about him while he was away. He \nsent home recordings and pictures--all of which Hal and Julie treasure. \nOne picture in particular always brings a smile to the Barkey family's \nfaces. In it, Michael is lying on the desert, pulling up his shirt to \nreveal grains of sand arranged in the shape of a smiley-face on his \nstomach.\n  Jesse accompanied his best friend on his final trip home. He said \nthat Michael was everything he wanted to be--as a person and as a \nsoldier. Jesse noted at a service honoring his friend that during the \ntrip home, ``I sat by Mike the whole way home and I did a lot of \ntalking. It was the first time Mike didn't talk back. I love him with \nevery piece of my broken heart.''\n  In Michael's hometown of Canal Fulton, OH, thousands of residents \ncame to show their support for the Barkey family. Some waited nearly \ntwo hours to pay their respects to Michael. The funeral mass was a \ncelebration of the life of this extraordinary soldier--and Julie Barkey \nwould have it no other way for the son who brought so much light into \nthe world.\n  Jennifer Barkey, Michael's older sister wrote the following \nremembrance letter to provide comfort to the family:\n\n       Know that [Michael] was truly an uncommon man. Grieve for \n     the incredible man, husband, and father he would have become. \n     Know that following the example of our father, he stood up \n     for what he believed. His conviction was such that he was \n     willing to die for it.\n\n  We know that Michael is in heaven, continuing to spread the laughter \nhe did while on earth. And perhaps the Barkey family is right--Michael \nis still cracking jokes, exchanging war stories with his grandfather, \nand is now the patron saint of Cheetos or hamburgers, which were his \nfavorite foods.\n  Michael will never be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5063-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5063-S5064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN REMEMBRANCE OF JOHN GREENO\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I speak to honor the memory of the late \nJohn Greeno, Bald Mountain heliport manager with the Mi-Wok Ranger \nDistrict of Stanislaus National Forest. Mr. Greeno was a 21-year \nveteran of the U.S. Forest Service who dedicated his life to his \nfamily, community, and Nation. He was killed in a tragic helicopter \ncrash in Texas on March 10, 2005, while on volunteer assignment to \nconduct a prescribed burn in Sabine National Forest.\n  John Greeno was born on June 2, 1952 in Redwood City, CA, and was \nraised in the town of Independence, CA. He embarked upon his career \nwith the U.S. Forest Service in 1979 as a temporary employee on the \nInyo National Forest. His love for firefighting and the U.S. Forest \nService led him to the Stanislaus National Forest where he would \neventually rise to the position of Helitack superintendent. During his \n21 years of service, John earned the respect and admiration of those \nwith whom he worked for consistently going above and beyond the call of \nduty. He led by example and was considered a mentor by subordinates. \nJohn regularly volunteered for assignments like the one that claimed \nhis life in Sabine\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\nNational Forest in order to sharpen his skills and bring back valuable \nknowledge for his home-base.\n  John Greeno will long be remembered for his courage and dedication. \nHe is survived by his wife of 11 years and his two children Marcus and \nMontana. His service and bravery inspired others and he will be deeply \nmissed. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5064-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE 110TH A.A.A. GUN BATTALION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the members of the \n110th A.A.A. Gun Battalion. This weekend, the 110th will be holding a \nreunion in Cromwell, CT, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the \nAllied victory in the Second World War.\n  The 110th played a critical role in the campaign in Europe. They were \ntrained in England in preparation for the Allied invasion in 1944. On \nJune 7 a day after D-Day they reached Omaha Beach in France with orders \nto ``protect all ground forces from enemy aircraft.'' Members of the \n110th also participated in the liberation of Paris, the crossing of the \nRhine, and the Battle of the Bulge.\n  The bravery and accomplishments of the 110th earned the unit \nconsiderable praise. Brigadier General E.W. Timberlake commended the \nmen of the 110th for their ``outstanding drive, tenacity of purpose, \nand aggressiveness,'' while Colonel Thomas Munford lauded the battalion \nfor its ``outstanding performance of every assigned mission, both in \ntraining and in battle.''\n  A few of the achievements of the 110th deserve particular \nrecognition. They successfully shot down what is believed to be the \nfirst German plane downed in France during the liberation of Europe. \nMembers of their reconnaissance team were among the first Americans to \nenter Paris. In total, the 110th destroyed 65 enemy planes, 11 tanks, \nand 80 ground vehicles.\n  It gives me a good deal of pride to note that many of the members of \nthe 110th hailed from Massachusetts and Connecticut. As the birthplace \nof our Nation, New England boasts a long and honored tradition of deep \npatriotism and dedicated service to our country. New Englanders have \nserved in every single one of our Nation's conflicts, from the \nRevolutionary War to Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  During the Second World War, the fate of not only our own Nation but \nthe world was at stake. And New Englanders joined our entire Nation in \nstepping forward to defend freedom against the forces of tyranny and \noppression.\n  Sadly, with each passing year, fewer and fewer of our World War II \nveterans remain with us. We can all remember the deeply emotional \nmoment last year when thousands of World War II vets gathered here in \nour Nation's capital for the opening of the National World War II \nMemorial. Just as notable, though, are the smaller gatherings that take \nplace around our Nation that provide veterans with the opportunity to \nrenew old ties, to meet each other's families, and to reminisce about \nthe unforgettable experiences they shared many years ago.\n  On that note, I would like to offer congratulations to Leo Kania of \nMiddletown, CT, who served as a corporal in the 110th. This week's \nreunion is the 6th such event Mr. Kania has organized over the years. \nThis weekend, members of the 110th will have the opportunity to tour \nthe very boat that took them to Omaha Beach six decades ago. The \ndedication Mr. Kania has shown is a testament to his devotion to his \nbattalion, his pride in his country, and his spirit of friendship.\n  I offer my congratulations and my humble thanks to the members of the \n110th A.A.A. Gun Battalion, and I extend my best wishes to them and \ntheir families on this momentous anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5064-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5064-S5066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT BY THE INTERNATIONAL LABOR ORGANIZATION ON FORCED LABOR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, more than ever before in history, \nemployees around the world are competing against each other for work. \nToo often, this competition has become a race to the bottom--whoever is \nwilling to work for the lowest wages gets the work.\n  The most flagrant example of this is the unacceptable practice of \nforced labor. These modern slaves are compelled to work against their \nwill, often as victims of human trafficking or ruthless governments.\n  A new report by the International Labor Office shows how massive the \nproblem of forced labor is. According to the report, over 12 million \npeople are its victims in today's world, and they produce $44 billion \nin profits for their overseers.\n  To combat the problem, the report urges countries to work together to \nreach a global solution. Countries need stronger laws to protect \nvictims and punish perpetrators. They also need stronger law \nenforcement and more effective cooperation between labor ministries and \nlaw enforcement. Fair labor standards and acting to reduce poverty are \nessential as well.\n  This report is the most comprehensive analysis ever made on forced \nlabor. I commend it to my colleagues, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe executive summary be printed in the Record. The full report is \navailable from www.ilo.org.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                A GLOBAL ALLIANCE AGAINST FORCED LABOUR\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\n                      The concept of forced labour\n\n       A Global Alliance Against Forced Labour sheds new light on \n     the nature and extent of forced labour in the world today, \n     what ILO member States, workers' and employers' organizations \n     and their partners are doing to tackle the problem, and what \n     more must be done if this crime and violation of human rights \n     is to be finally ended. As the second Global Report on forced \n     labour under the Follow-up to the Declaration on Fundamental \n     Principles and Rights at Work, it focuses especially on the \n     period since Stopping Forced Labour, its first report on the \n     subject, was published in 2001.\n       This period has seen many important developments, in terms \n     of heightened global awareness of the problems of \n     contemporary forced labour, and particularly of trafficking \n     in persons, and an increased understanding of what it \n     involves--who and where are the victims and the perpetrators, \n     how people get trapped in forced labour situations, and what \n     kinds of measures have proved effective in preventing and \n     combating this criminal practice, for which there can be no \n     place in the twenty first century. Far from being a concern \n     of only a minority of countries, forced labour in its \n     different forms is a problem that pervades all societies--\n     developing, transition and industrialized alike. It affects \n     millions of people, and generates billions of dollars of \n     profits for the exploiters of forced labourers.\n       The Report first sets out to clarify what the ILO means by \n     forced labour. It certainly cannot be equated simply with low \n     wages or poor working conditions. It comprises two basic \n     elements: the work or service is exacted under the menace of \n     a penalty, and it is undertaken involuntarily. This menace \n     can take extreme forms such as physical violence, but also \n     subtler forms such as confiscation of identity papers or \n     threats of denunciation of irregular migrants to police \n     authorities, in order to extract unfair advantage from them. \n     A forced labour situation is determined by the nature of the \n     relationship between a person and an ``employer'', and not by \n     the activity performed. Nevertheless, there is a broad \n     spectrum of working conditions and practices, ranging from \n     extreme exploitation including forced labour at one end, to \n     decent work with the full application of labour standards at \n     the other. And within the area defined by law as forced \n     labour, a range of coercive and deceptive mechanisms can be \n     applied. The most appropriate law enforcement remedies may \n     depend on the nature, and perhaps also the severity, of the \n     coercive mechanisms being applied.\n       The rising global concern with human trafficking, together \n     with new instruments against it, have prompted member States \n     to give attention to the forced labour concept in criminal \n     laws. The ``Palermo'' Trafficking Protocol to the UN \n     Convention against Transnational Organized Crime introduces \n     into international law the concept of exploitation, broken \n     down broadly into labour and sexual exploitation. It is clear \n     from the comments of the ILO supervisory bodies that coercive \n     sexual exploitation also constitutes forced labour. Many \n     countries at present do not provide in their legislation for \n     the specific offence of forced labour. While the present \n     momentum is towards establishing the criminal offence of \n     trafficking, there is a need also to legislate against forced \n     labour as a specific criminal offence.\n\n\n             Minimum estimate of forced labour in the world\n\n       Today, at least 12.3 million people are victims of forced \n     labour worldwide. Of these, 9.8 million are exploited by \n     private agents, including more than 2.4 million in forced \n     labour as a result of human trafficking. The remaining 2.5 \n     million are forced to work by the State or by rebel military \n     groups.\n       The numbers are highest in Asia, with 9,490,000 victims. \n     Almost two-thirds of total\n\n[[Page S5065]]\n\n     forced labour in Asia is imposed by private actors for \n     economic exploitation, mostly debt bondage in agriculture and \n     other economic activities. About one-fifth is imposed by the \n     State in a few countries such as Myanmar. Forced labour for \n     commercial sexual exploitation makes up less than one-tenth \n     of the total.\n       Latin America and the Caribbean has 1,320,000 forced labour \n     victims. 75 per cent is imposed by private actors for \n     economic exploitation, followed by State-imposed forced \n     labour (16 per cent) and forced labour in commercial sexual \n     exploitation (9 per cent). Of the 660,000 forced labourers in \n     Sub-Saharan Africa, 80 per cent are subject to economic \n     exploitation, 11 per cent to State-imposed forced labour, and \n     8 per cent to commercial sexual exploitation. Of the 260,000 \n     forced labour cases in the Middle East and North Africa \n     (MENA), 88 per cent is for private economic exploitation, and \n     10 per cent for commercial sexual exploitation.\n       There are 360,000 forced labourers in industrialized \n     countries, and 210,000 in transition countries. In both \n     regions, forced labour for commercial sexual exploitation \n     predominates. In industrialized countries however, almost \n     one-quarter of victims are subject to non-sexual economic \n     exploitation.\n       Approximately one-fifth of all forced labour globally--or \n     2.45 million persons altogether--is an outcome of \n     trafficking. There are important regional variations. In \n     Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, the proportion of \n     trafficked victims is less than 20 per cent of all forced \n     labour. In industrialized and transition countries, and in \n     the Middle East and North Africa, it accounts for more than \n     75 per cent of all forced labour.\n       Women and girls are overwhelmingly involved in forced \n     commercial sexual exploitation--accounting for 98% of the \n     total of this form. Forced economic exploitation is more \n     evenly divided between the sexes, although women and girls \n     still account for more than half--56%. It is estimated that \n     children aged less than 18 years represent between 40 and 50% \n     of all forced labour victims.\n\n\n               A dynamic global picture of forced labour\n\n       Since the first Global Report on the subject in 2001, the \n     research and activities of the ILO's Special Action Programme \n     to Combat Forced Labour (SAP-FL) have shed more light on \n     recent trends in forced labour, and action to overcome it, in \n     all regions of the world.\n       Generally, despite new laws and action programmes against \n     trafficking, law enforcement against forced labour practices \n     remains inadequate. There have been very few prosecutions of \n     exploiters of forced labour anywhere. The offence of forced \n     labour is often not identified as such in existing criminal \n     law (though it may be under labour or administrative law). \n     Penalties are often light. Important progress in combating \n     impunity for forced labour offences has nevertheless been \n     made in some countries, such as Brazil.\n       Forced labour imposed by the State, while not the largest \n     problem in terms of numbers, remains a cause for serious \n     concern. In Myanmar, the ILO has taken a lead in drawing \n     attention to continued forced labour practices, which occur \n     in particular in remote areas under the authority of the \n     army. An ILO Liaison Officer has been able to assess the \n     situation in person through field visits, while in May 2003 \n     agreement was reached in principle between the Government and \n     the ILO on a Joint Plan of Action against forced labour. By \n     early 2005, however, the ILO was not in a position to move \n     forward on this. Indeed the Myanmar case shows that it is \n     impossible to make progress against forced labour when there \n     is a climate of impunity, and repression against persons who \n     denounce forced labour abuses.\n       In China, steps have been made towards reform of the \n     Reeducation through Labour (RETL) system, an administrative \n     measure including compulsory labour that is used for \n     punishing minor offences. As of early 2004, some 260,000 \n     persons were detailed under RETL. Reform to the RETL system \n     is on the agenda of the current session of the National \n     Peoples' Congress.\n       The forced labour aspects of prison labour have also been a \n     cause for concern in industrialized countries. The focus has \n     mainly been on the eradication of forced labour in private \n     prisons, or by prisoners placed at the disposal of private \n     companies. Yet some consensus is emerging that, while prison \n     privatization is probably here to stay, the central issue in \n     the debate should be how to secure minimum standards of work \n     for those detained in all kinds of prison establishment. In \n     this sense--while prison authorities tend to stress that work \n     is only one aspect of the prison regime--there can be scope \n     for labour inspection services to collaborate with prison \n     authorities on matters which relate strictly to the work \n     regime.\n       In developing countries there are clear links between \n     poverty and discrimination on the one hand, and forced labour \n     on the other. The victims are drawn from lower castes in \n     parts of Asia, indigenous peoples in Latin America, the \n     descendants of slaves or forest dwellers in Africa. Patterns \n     of forced labour are nevertheless changing. In addition to \n     traditional agrarian-based serfdom and servitude, new forms \n     of coercion often linked to indebtedness are being detected \n     in a range of sectors and industries, such as brick making, \n     mining, rice mills and domestic work. The asset-poor or \n     landless are particularly vulnerable to forced labour, when \n     they move away from their home communities in search of work \n     in distant parts of their own country, neighbouring countries \n     or overseas. Similar patterns of coercive recruitment and \n     debt bondage have been detected amongst seasonal and migrant \n     workers in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Again, women and \n     children can be especially prone to be trapped in \n     exploitative living and working situations, from which they \n     have great difficulty escaping.\n       Tackling such forced labour requires action at different \n     levels. Downstream, there have been important community-based \n     initiatives, using microfinance and other techniques to \n     prevent forced labour and rehabilitate victims after release. \n     Upstream, there is a need for clear policies and plans of \n     action, mobilizing awareness, getting the involvement of \n     different ministries, ensuring the cooperation of labour \n     authorities and other law enforcement agents, and also \n     securing the necessary resources for action against forced \n     labour. One way to achieve this is to include forced and \n     bonded labour concerns in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers \n     (PRSP) and similar policy instruments. Some models are \n     emerging. Brazil and Pakistan have broad-based action plans \n     against forced labour. Nepal and Pakistan address bonded \n     labour in their PRSPs.\n       In Africa, the eradication of--and even the clear \n     understanding of--forced labour poses complex challenges in a \n     context of poverty and tradition. Unpaid services can be part \n     of traditional kinship arrangements. There are reports that \n     West Africans of slave descent still suffer discrimination \n     and labour exploitation at the hands of former masters. \n     Research points to a spectrum of situations, from the highly \n     exploitative to the relatively benign. And in some African \n     countries forced labour has occurred in a context of severe \n     political violence and inter-ethnic conflict. Problems of \n     contemporary forced labour include: slavery and abductions, \n     debt bondage, forced overtime, unpaid compulsory labour for \n     public servants, and forced domestic labour. There are prima \n     facie reasons to believe that forced labour may be a \n     widespread problem in the continent. But far more research \n     and awareness raising is needed, to deepen understanding and \n     chart out a way forward.\n       The scourge of human trafficking has now caught the world's \n     attention. It is bringing forced labour concerns to the \n     doorstep of industrialized countries. More and more, ILO \n     partners realize that effective action against trafficking \n     requires a focus on its forced labour outcomes, and on demand \n     aspects in the destination countries as well as supply in the \n     origin countries. ILO research in Europe and elsewhere has \n     shed light on these issues, paving the way for improved \n     policies and law enforcement. Affecting sectors including \n     agriculture, construction, textiles and garments, restaurants \n     and entertainment, health care, and domestic work, \n     trafficking for labour exploitation often involves subtle \n     forms of coercion rather than direct physical restraint. \n     Unscrupulous employers exploit the precarious situation of \n     irregular migrant workers in particular, removing identity \n     documents, and threatening them with denunciation to the \n     authorities and deportation if they do not accept substandard \n     conditions of work. Migrant domestic workers are at \n     particular risk of forced labour situations. So far, there \n     have been very few convictions of abusive employers or \n     intermediaries involved in the trafficking of domestic \n     workers.\n       Forced labour and trafficking are not limited to the \n     underground economy. With more research, it is becoming \n     clearer that coercive practices can affect migrants in quite \n     mainstream economic sectors. Deceptive practices by \n     recruitment agencies, and long chains of subcontracting, can \n     involve exorbitant transaction costs which drive even legally \n     recruited migrants into debt bondage situations. There have \n     been examples of good practice, such as the 2004 United \n     Kingdom Gangmasters Act, which increase controls over such \n     agencies. In transition countries however standards to \n     monitor the work of recruitment agencies are still very weak. \n     Government authorities, law enforcement agents and the social \n     partners need training to prevent the risk of trafficking.\n       Trafficking is a highly lucrative business. The ILO \n     estimates that total illicit profits produced annually by \n     trafficked forced labourers are around US$ 32 Billion (half \n     of this in industrialized countries and one third in Asia). \n     This means an average of US$ 13,000 per year for each forced \n     labourer. By far the highest profits are made from forced \n     commercial sexual exploitation (US$ 27.8 Billion).\n       The apparent growth of trafficking for economic \n     exploitation in all regions calls for serious thinking as to \n     the most effective means to eradicate it. Vigorous law \n     enforcement will always be part of the solution, but many \n     other measures are required. Our previous (2001) Global \n     Report depicted human trafficking as the ``underside of \n     globalization''. The knowledge base has now shed further \n     light on the linkages between forced labour more generally, \n     and such aspects of globalization as global competition, \n     migration and labour market deregulation. Without safeguards, \n     competitive pressures can lead to forced labour. Eradicating \n     coercive practices represents a major challenge for \n     employers' and workers' organizations worldwide.\n\n\n                    ILO action against forced labour\n\n       Spearheaded by its Special Action Programme to Combat \n     Forced Labour (SAP-FL)\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\n     under the Declaration Follow-up, the ILO has progressively \n     increased its profile and activities on forced labour over \n     this four-year period. Guided by its Governing Body mandate, \n     the programme has emphasized: advice on appropriate \n     legislation; awareness raising on forced labour, among both \n     the general population and key authorities; research and \n     surveys, on the nature and extent of the problems; \n     prevention, through advocacy, vigorous application of \n     national laws and regulations, and by tackling underlying \n     causes; and sustainable support and rehabilitation measures.\n       SAP-FL has been active in many parts of the world in a \n     short period of time. Awareness-raising has been conducted in \n     all regions, and with major international partners. There is \n     growing consensus that forced labour is the key entry point \n     for anti-trafficking action. Research--in South and South-\n     East Asia, transition and industrialized countries and Latin \n     America--has for the first time provided a full understanding \n     of the nature of modern forced labour, and of the action \n     needed to eradicate it. Law and policy advice have been \n     provided to Asian countries including China, Mongolia and \n     Vietnam, paving the way for ratification of the ILO's \n     Conventions on forced labour.\n       Several ILO projects aim to strengthen institutional \n     structures for combating forced labour. A Brazilian project \n     supports the Government's National Action Plan against Slave \n     Labour, working with several ministries, police, judiciary \n     and labour authorities as partner agencies. The project, in \n     part through a massive awareness campaign, has contributed to \n     the significant rise in the number of forced labourers \n     rescued in Brazil. In South Asia, a project to promote the \n     prevention and elimination of bonded labour has gradually \n     developed new tools for tackling this immense problem. With \n     an initial focus on using microfinance to prevent bonded \n     labour and assist the rehabilitation of released bonded \n     labourers at the community level, it has moved increasingly \n     into capacity-strengthening of Government agencies and other \n     partners. In Pakistan, ILO assistance has largely been \n     designed to support the goals first set out in the 2001 \n     National Policy and Plan of Action on bonded labour.\n       On trafficking, research and studies in both origin and \n     destination countries have prepared the ground for integrated \n     programmes across the trafficking cycle, combining \n     prevention, victim identification and protection, law \n     enforcement, and rehabilitation of victims. As requested by \n     international partners the ILO has taken a lead in \n     providing guidance to member States on the forced labour \n     and labour exploitation dimensions of trafficking, drawing \n     on pertinent ILO standards. Operational projects are now \n     under way in West Africa, South East Asia, China, and \n     Eastern and Western Europe. In particular, these projects \n     aim to involve labour authorities and other institutions \n     including employers' and workers' organizations in action \n     against trafficking, demonstrating the importance of their \n     cooperation with police, prosecutors and law enforcement \n     agencies in general.\n\n\n          Action Plan: A Global Alliance Against Forced Labour\n\n       The ILO now calls for a global alliance against forced \n     labour. It will require national commitment to eradicate \n     forced labour through plans with specific time horizons. \n     National plans and programmes will need to be backed by \n     extensive international assistance, notably from the \n     development agencies and financial institutions concerned \n     with poverty reduction. Asia, where the numbers affected by \n     contemporary forced labour are the largest, must be the \n     highest priority. The development agencies, which base their \n     strategies on poverty targeting and the eradication of \n     extreme poverty, should single out bonded labour systems for \n     priority attention. In Latin America, where the incidence of \n     forced labour is particularly severe amongst indigenous \n     peoples, poverty reduction progammes and resources can be \n     targeted at the peoples and areas affected.\n       As regards forced labour and trafficking, the destination \n     countries need to take their share of responsibility. All \n     countries need to include provisions against forced labour \n     and trafficking in their criminal laws, involving labour law \n     experts in the drafting process. There is a need for more \n     awareness of the role of demand for cheap and flexible labour \n     in the destination countries in giving rise to trafficking \n     and forced labour, and also for more rational migration \n     management.\n       Universities, research and policy institutions need to \n     improve the knowledge base on forced labour. Priority can be \n     given to the difficult issues, where there is currently a \n     lack of consensus as to whether and which practices do \n     constitute forced labour. One example is the forced labour \n     aspects of prison labour.\n       The ILO can take an active leadership in this global \n     alliance. It can set targets for eradicating the forced and \n     bonded labour problems linked to structural poverty, as part \n     of its contribution to achievement of the Millennium \n     Development Goals. It can identify specific steps, with \n     targets for the coming years, against the forced labour \n     problems linked to globalization. Employers and workers' \n     organizations will have a key role to play, the former \n     developing codes of conduct to ensure vigilance against \n     forced labour in supply chains, the latter helping the \n     informal economy workers vulnerable to forced labour in their \n     efforts to organize themselves and seek redress. Through \n     their regional and international networks, transport and \n     other unions can exercise permanent vigilance against human \n     trafficking.\n       The ILO can help member States improve data gathering on \n     forced labour. Reliable forced labour statistics must now be \n     developed at the national level, providing benchmarks against \n     which progress can be measured over time.\n       Through operational projects, the ILO can greatly help \n     member States eradicate forced labour. The aim will be to \n     develop ``models'' of intervention, which can then be applied \n     on a wider scale by others. These should comprise linked \n     components, addressing upstream policy and legal issues, as \n     well as strengthening enforcement institutions and providing \n     direct support for victims. In developing such integrated \n     projects the ILO needs to draw on all its capacities, as they \n     relate to employment promotion as well as the application of \n     labour standards.\n       In developing projects, however, it must be remembered that \n     hard policy decisions are required to end forced labour. Such \n     instruments as microfinance are important for prevention and \n     rehabilitation, and will always be part of the ``toolkit'' \n     against forced labour. But to combat impunity, and to tackle \n     the roots of either the more traditional or more modern forms \n     of forced labour, member States may ultimately have to \n     revisit their land, tenancy, labour market or even migration \n     policies.\n       With courage and commitment to face up to the problems, and \n     with the allocation of resources to meet the challenges, \n     there is a real hope that forced labour can finally be \n     relegated to history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5066-S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few words in honor \nof the Asian and Pacific Islander communities of the United States. As \nmy colleagues know, May marks Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month. \nThroughout this month, the United States celebrates the history, \nculture, and traditions of Asian and Pacific Islanders, and recognizes \ntheir unique contributions to the United States.\n  First proposed as a 1-week celebration in 1977, the occasion was \nexpanded into a month-long event in 1990. May was chosen because of its \nunique significance to the history of Asian Americans. May 7, 1843 \nmarked the first recorded immigration of Japanese to the United States, \nwhile May 10, 1869 marked the completion of the transcontinental \nrailroad, which would not have happened when it did without the labor \nof Chinese immigrants.\n  The Asian and Pacific Islander population has a rich history in this \ncountry, especially in the Pacific Northwest. In my home State, records \nshow the arrival of Asian immigrants as early as the 1860s, while some \nscholars even speculate that Chinese explorers sailed down the Alaskan \ncoast to what is now Washington State centuries before. Today, there \nare nearly 13 million Asians and Pacific Islanders living in the United \nStates, representing 4.4 percent of the population. In Washington, they \nmake up nearly 6 percent of the citizenry.\n  Over the past century and a half, Asian and Pacific Islander \ncommunities have contributed significantly to the cultural vibrancy of \nWashington State. Individuals within Washington's Asian and Pacific \nIslander communities have also worked to stand up for justice and make \nour country a better place. In 1944, Gordon Hirabayashi, a Japanese-\nAmerican student at the University of Washington in Seattle, took a \nstand against the unfair treatment of Japanese Americans during World \nWar II when he refused to obey discriminatory curfew orders. In taking \nhis case to the U.S. Supreme Court, he left a lasting reminder of the \nimportance of standing up for civil rights.\n  America is a land of immigrants and our history demonstrates that we \nare stronger because of our diversity, not in spite of it. However, we \ncan only live up to the promise of our diversity if we recognize the \nmistakes of our past and give all groups a voice in public discourse. \nAsian Americans have a powerful history in the Pacific Northwest, and I \nbelieve we cannot ignore its darkest period. For this reason, I was \npleased to work with Senator Patty Murray to secure Federal funding for \na study of the Eagledale Ferry Dock site on Bainbridge Island, which \nserved as a point of departure for members of the Japanese-American \ncommunity on their way to internment camps during World War II. These \nfunds are a critical\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\nstep toward commemorating the sacrifices and the strength of the \nJapanese-American community, and to recognizing an important chapter in \nthe history of Bainbridge Island, my State, and our Nation.\n  I am proud to represent a State with a history of electing a diverse \ngroup of citizens to public office. In 1993, Filipina-American Velma \nVeloria became the first Asian-American woman to serve in the \nWashington State Legislature. Over the past decade, her work to fight \nhuman trafficking and promote peace and social justice has truly made \nmy State a better place. Since then, Washington State has also seen the \nservice of Gary Locke, Washington's first Asian-American Governor, and \nPaul Shin, the first Asian American to serve in the State senate. In \nfact, the rich history of Asians and Pacific Islanders holding elected \noffice in Washington State dates back to 1962, when Wing Luke, a \ndecorated World War II veteran and former Assistant Attorney General of \nthe State of Washington, won a seat on Seattle's city council. Today, \nhis legacy is commemorated in Seattle's Wing Luke Asian Museum, along \nwith the stories of thousands of other Asian immigrants. I am \npersonally honored to be involved in renovating the museum's East Kong \nYick building, one of the first two buildings in Seattle owned by \nnonwhites. The museum is both a local and national treasure, respected \nas a Smithsonian affiliate and honored at the White House 10 years ago \nwith the National Award for Museum Services.\n  As this year's Asian Pacific American Heritage month begins, I \nbelieve it is important to preserve the lessons of the past, while \nrecognizing the immense benefit we all receive from living in a diverse \ncountry built on the contributions of immigrants from around the globe. \nDiversity, and the exposure to other customs and ideas that it \ninvolves, leads to opportunity and gives the United States much of its \nstrength. In celebrating the rich history, culture, and traditions of \nAsian and Pacific Islanders this May, we recognize their important \ncontributions to the strength and diversity of our country, and to the \nbright future that lies ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5067-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PASSING OF VICKI COTTRELL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, with the untimely death of Vicki Cottrell, \nUtah's executive director of the National Alliance for the Mentally \nIll, NAMI, a powerful and compassionate voice who spoke for those who \nsuffer the effects of mental illness has been silenced. Vicki \nCottrell's untiring efforts across Utah, in the legislature, in the \njails and mental health courts, among community and religious leaders, \nand among families, will be difficult to replace. The passionate spirit \nand vision that she shared with her staff will continue.\n  Before working for NAMI Utah, Vicki worked in computer software \nsales. But after her daughter was diagnosed with schizophrenia, Vicki \nformed her own support group for people who have loved ones with a \nmental illness. Eventually, she merged her group with NAMI Utah.\n  Over the past 20 years, Vicki has worked for the National Alliance \nfor the Mentally Ill's Utah affiliate. She started as a volunteer \nteaching classes and worked her way up to the executive director's \npost. Going the distance to places like Logan was common for her, and \nshe took a message of advocacy around the State. Vicki's influence did \nnot just reach inside Utah's borders, though. Upon hearing of her \ndeath, NAMI members and friends from across the country brought forth \nan outpouring of sympathy.\n  Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. expressed his condolences noting that \nVicki helped educate many about mental illness and the way new medical \ntreatments help the afflicted lead very productive lives. He said, \n``She traveled throughout the Nation sharing this message of hope and \nwill be greatly missed by all who knew her.''\n  Vicki was a member of my Advisory Committee on Disability Issues for \nthe State of Utah. She worked closely with my office and visited with \nme and my staff in both Washington and Utah to advocate for the needs \nof the mentally ill. Her strong commitment to those suffering from \nmental illness was well known throughout Utah. She provided valuable \ninsights to the Advisory Committee and will be missed by all of the \ncommittee members.\n  The love and respect so many felt for Vicki Cottrell came from her \nwillingness to use her own family's struggle with schizophrenia as an \nexample and turn it into something to help others cope. She worked hard \nto eliminate the stigma often attached to mental illness, and was \ntireless, energetic and motivated in her mission.\n  Vicki's grace, humanity, and love touched every life she met. Her \npublic life never overshadowed her deep devotion for her 6 children and \n10 grandchildren. She was a loyal friend and enjoyed close \nrelationships with many. Her beautiful and well-attended garden was a \nmetaphor for her life.\n  I ask that my colleagues please join me in extending heartfelt \nsympathies to Vicki's family and friends. The magnitude of the loss for \nUtah and the Nation is substantial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5067-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      HONORING MG RICHARD S.

MG Richard S. \nColt has served as the commanding general of the 77th Regional \nReadiness Command based at Fort Totten, NY, for the last 4 years, and I \nam honored to recognize him on the floor of the Senate. He celebrates \nhis retirement after 38 years of service to this country. While I am a \nSenator from Idaho and he is a commanding general from the State of New \nYork, he deserves all of our praise because he was on duty in New York \nCity on September 11, 2001.\n  Major General Colt is a Vietnam veteran who has always put soldiers \nfirst. His emphasis on readiness and training has prepared our citizen \nsoldiers for the current global war on terror.\n  General Colt is among the finest this country has to offer, and he \nleads by example. He trains, teaches, and leads his soldiers. He will \nbe sorely missed by his soldiers and by all of us who cherish freedom. \nWe honor his service, congratulate him on his retirement, and reflect \non the accomplishments of this great leader.\n  His dates of service are from July 25, 1967 to June 19, 2005. I know \nthat his family is very proud of him, including his wife Dorothy and \nhis daughters Mary Colt and Jennifer Sullivan and grandson Ryan Richard \nSullivan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5067-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5067-S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      A LIFE OF TEACHING, A LOVE OF LEARNING, A HEART FOR CHILDREN\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize a truly \nremarkable individual today. Gail Chumbley is a history teacher at \nEagle High School in Eagle, ID. A high school history teacher; there \nare many individuals who can claim this job title but few who have done \nso much. Gail is an amazing teacher, passionately devoted to teaching \nour American experience to her students. Not only does she teach about \nevents in our Nation's history, she has ventured into the next realm, \nmoving the tenets of American citizenship into the real world for her \nstudents.\n  I first heard of Gail's efforts 4 years ago when she became actively \ninvolved in the Library of Congress's Veterans Oral History Project \nfour years ago. At that time, she had organized the recording of over \n300 oral histories for Eagle High School's library alone. She expanded \nthe effort to include other Idaho schools and collaborated with local \ncivics groups to record literally hundreds more interviews that went to \nboth the Eagle High School archives and the Idaho Oral History Center. \nOne of the most significant accomplishments of Gail and her students \nwas their participation in the Veterans Stand Down in Boise where \nhomeless veterans were given the opportunity to record interviews. Her \nefforts were not confined to veterans of past wars. Gail and her \nstudents also have sent gift boxes and cards to our current service \nwomen and men in Iraq and Afghanistan since 2002. She was instrumental \nin making Eagle High School the top school donor for the World War II \nMemorial, with a donation of close to $25,000. The list of her \naccomplishments, enhanced further with her national recognition by the \nDaughters of\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\nthe American Revolution this year is long, but that is not the focus of \nmy remarks today.\n  Gail has turned the teaching of history and civics into the action of \npatriotism. Perhaps the most compelling and significant accomplishment \nof Gail Chumbley is not her esteemed list of awards and honors, which \nare many and richly-deserved. Her most important contribution is her \nrole in creating a sense of citizenship within the hearts and intellect \nof many Idaho young people. This citizenship lives on in these students \nas they grow into adulthood and manifests itself in their actions, \ncommitments and convictions. It is an entity that grows exponentially \nand of its own volition, eclipsing plaques, certificates and \nstatuettes. These gather dust, but what they represent are the pillars \nupon which our country stands firm. This living citizenship is \nimmortalized by the marbled statues of men and women not far from here, \nand in words carved of the same.\n  I honor Gail Chumbley today: American patriot, exemplary citizen and \nrole model for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5068-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO JOSEPH P. FITZGERALD\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I salute Joseph P. Fitzgerald, who \nis retiring after 33 years of dedicated service to the Government and \npeople of the United States of America.\n  For the past quarter century, Mr. Fitzgerald has worked in the \nAudiovisual Program Development Branch at the Lister Hill National \nCenter for Biocommunications, which is part of the National Library of \nMedicine at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD. Mr. \nFitzgerald, who is a renaissance man of creative vision and artistic \ntalent, has made exceptional contributions to the outreach and \ncommunications mission of the largest biomedical library in the world. \nAs technological advances in the dissemination of both visual and text-\nbased information have evolved over the past 25 years, Mr. Fitzgerald \nhas led the way in adopting computer-based graphics systems. And he has \nhelped the National Library of Medicine to communicate the most current \nand reliable medical and consumer health information to medical \nprofessionals, researchers, patients, families and the public.\n  The number 25 figures prominently in the life story of Joe Fitzgerald \nfor another reason, too. He recently became the 25th person in the \nhistory of the Republic to execute a design for the front of a \ncirculating coin. His groundbreaking portrait of Thomas Jefferson \ngraces the new U.S. five-cent coin, as will his obverse design of the \nLewis and Clark expedition, which will be released in August. Both \ncommissions were awarded as part of the United States Mint at the \nTreasury Department's Artistic Infusion Program. Mr. Fitzgerald's \nportrait of Thomas Jefferson marks the first redesign of the front of \nthe nickel in 67 years. His nickel designs have been acclaimed \nthroughout the coin collecting community, and Mr. Fitzgerald has \nreceived significant national press attention.\n\n  Joe Fitzgerald earned a B.A. in fine arts from the University of \nMaryland, College Park and pursued graduate studies in printmaking at \nthe State University of New York at Oswego. He has served several \nFederal agencies: the United States Postal Service, summers, 168-1972; \nthe Food & Drug Administration, 1972-1973; the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission, 1973-1980; and the National Library of Medicine, 1980-2005. \nMr. Fitzgerald has earned numerous awards for outstanding contributions \nand service to the National Library of Medicine, including the 1996 NLM \nDirector's Honor Award for exceptional contributions to the mission of \nthe library through the creative application of his artistic talent, \nand the 2003 National Institutes of Health Award for Merit for his \norganization, coordination and congenial leadership in effectively \norchestrating the ``Turning the Pages'' historical medical books \nprogram.\n  In addition, Mr. Fitzgerald is a gifted fine artist. Nationally \nrecognized for his work in paint, pastel and digital media, his \ncreations have been sent around the world through the Embassy Art \nprogram, and are held in many private collections. He is currently \nrepresented by the Foxhall Gallery in Washington, DC.\n  Joe Fitzgerald is one of the most beloved individuals ever to tread \nthe NIH campus, and I wish him well in his retirement. He is married to \nJean Hill Fitzgerald, another career civil servant who currently works \nat the National Archives. I thank Joe for distinguished career in \npublic service, and I wish him many years of happiness in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5068-2", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF MR.

Mr. President, I pay tribute and congratulate Mr. \nJim Huff of Northern Kentucky who was recently honored with one of the \n``Movers and Shakers'' awards for the Greater Cincinnati area. Mr. \nHuffs life accomplishments and dedication to Commonwealth of Kentucky \nhave given me reason to be proud.\n  Over the past 60 years, Mr. Huff has grown to be a leader both within \nthe community of Northern Kentucky and within the real estate industry. \nHe has served as chairman of the Kentucky Real Estate Commission for \nfive consecutive terms. During this time he established a statewide \nerrors and omissions insurance platform, which continues to serve the \nneeds of Kentucky real estate practitioners today. In 1981, he was \nawarded Realtor of the Year by the Kenton-Boone Board of Realtors, for \nwhich he later served as president.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Huff has always been active in civic affairs \nin Northern Kentucky.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Helsinki \nCommission, I welcomed the recent visit of Romanian Foreign Minister \nRazvan Ungureanu, and I regret that I was not in Washington to meet \nwith him. Our countries have forged closer links, and I hope that trend \nwill continue.\n  While there have been many positive reforms implemented in Romania, \nunfortunately the situation of the Romani minority is largely the same. \nRomania has the largest Roma minority in Europe, estimated at 1.5-2 \nmillion people. They remain profoundly marginalized and subjected to \npervasive discrimination and prejudice.\n  On April 13, for example, a soccer match in Bucharest turned very, \nvery ugly. Fans of one team, Steaua Bucharest, unfurled a banner \nreading ``We have always had and will always have something against \nGypsies.'' They chanted, ``We have always hated Gypsies and we have \nalways urinated on you.'' During the game, the stadium announcer played \nan anti-Roma song called ``Gypsies and UFOs'' and made anti-Roma \nremarks. The coach of Steaua Bucharest called the coach of the opposing \nteam a ``stinking Gypsy.'' The opposing team, Rapid Bucharest, is from \na district with a significant Romani minority.\n  Response to this rabid anti-Roma manifestation was swift with mixed \nresults.\n  On April 20, the Romanian Football League suspended the stadium \nannouncer for 6 months. But the League also sanctioned both teams that \nwere present at the April 13 match: Steaua Bucharest, the team \nresponsible for hurling racist invective was fined, but so was Rapid \nBucharest, the team against whom these slurs were directed. While it is \ncompletely appropriate for a sports league to police\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nitself and its members, sanctioning those who were the targets of this \nabuse makes no sense. No one will be fooled by the League's effort to \nappear pro-active and even-handed while punishing the very people who \nwere the victims of abuse.\n  The National Council for Combating Discrimination, a Romanian \nGovernment body, also sanctioned the offending team about $1400 and \nfined the stadium announcer about $600. The fact that a governmental \nbody so quickly recognized the racist nature of these events was a \npositive signal. However, any time a state positions itself to regulate \nspeech, there is the risk that free speech, which may include unpopular \nor controversial views, will be unduly limited. I believe there are \nother ways to combat racist, xenophobic, or anti-Semitic \nmanifestations. In particular, it is critical that Romania's public \nleaders, including President Traian Basescu, speak out against such \nmanifestations.\n  Unfortunately, the April 13 events were not an isolated phenomenon, \nbut part of a pattern of racist abuse in Romania. In 2002, scores of \nfans at a Bucharest soccer match worked in concert to display a massive \nsign reading ``Die, Gypsy.'' In 2003, like-minded fans displayed a sign \nreading ``One million crows, one solution--Antonescu.'' ``Crow'' is a \npejorative slang term in Romanian for a member of the Romani minority. \nGeneral Ion Antonescu was Romania's World War II fascist dictator who \nspearheaded the selection of Roma for deportation to Transnistria.\n  These manifestations tell us two things. First, it is not enough for \npublic leaders to leave it to the National Council for Combating Racism \nto speak out against these manifestations. Romania's highest leaders \nmust stand up and confront such outrages. Those who would foment \nracism, and who potentially incite racist violence, must be given no \nsafe harbor. Invoking praise for the World War II dictator who oversaw \nthe persecution of Romania's Jews and Roma is despicable.\n  Second, these manifestations underscore the need for continued \nefforts to improve Holocaust education in Romania.\n  Following decades of denial, the Government of Romania has made great \nstrides in the past year in recognizing Romania's role in the Holocaust \nand in the deportation and death of Jewish and Romani citizens. The \ngovernment is to be commended for taking steps to examine this dark and \npainful chapter in the country's history. Last November, the \nInternational Commission for the Study of the Holocaust in Romania, led \nby Elie Wiesel, officially issued its findings in Bucharest. In \naddition to the establishment of a national Holocaust Remembrance Day, \nwhich Romania marks on October 9, the Commission recommended that \nRomania establish a national Holocaust memorial and museum in \nBucharest, annul war criminal rehabilitations and develop a Holocaust \neducation curricula and courses in secondary schools and universities. \nI hope the Government of Romania will move quickly to implement the \nWiesel Commission's recommendations.\n  With this in mind, I was heartened to learn that in April the U.S. \nEmbassy in Bucharest hosted the premier of ``Hidden Sorrows,'' a \ndocumentary about the tragic deportation of 25,000 Roma from Romania to \nTransnistria during the Holocaust; more than 11,000 men, women and \nchildren died from the horrific conditions of their internment. \nSeveral, nearly 100-year-old survivors attended the premier, adding a \ndeeply personal element to the documentary's message.\n  From the Inquisition to the Holocaust, Roma have suffered some of \nhumanity's worst abuses. They were enslaved in Romania until the \nformation of the modern Romanian state in 1864. They were persecuted \nand deported and murdered during the Holocaust. Even after the fall of \nCeausescu, they were subjected to dozens of pogroms. And yet they have \nsurvived.\n  The Romani people, who have endured so much, should not be made to \nsuffer at a time that otherwise holds so much promise and hope for so \nmany. We must ensure that these people, their culture, and their \nheritage are not destroyed by hatred and violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5069-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:33 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1279.

A bill to establish a national historic country store \npreservation program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have long been a proponent of measures \nthat support historic preservation and economic development, and it is \nin keeping with that tradition that I rise today to introduce the \nNational Historic Country Store Preservation Act of 2005.\n  This bill establishes a national program to support historic country \nstore preservation that will aid in the revitalization of rural \nvillages and community centers nationwide.\n  For many Americans, the country store invokes an image of a simpler \nlife before much of this country became stamped with shopping malls and \nthe ``big-box'' store.\n  But for thousands of people living in Vermont and for millions more \nliving in rural communities across the United States, a visit to the \nlocal country store is a regular part of one's daily life.\n  They are centers of commercial activity in the towns they serve and \nembody the core of American small business entrepreneurship.\n  Many of these vital small businesses have been passed down among \nfamily members for generations. They are operated in buildings that \nhave existed for as long as 150 years.\n  In fact, by one of the more vigorous standards in Vermont, a country \nstore is only considered historic if it was built before the Winooski \nRiver Flood of 1927.\n  In my hometown of Shrewsbury, VT, the Pierce Store was the hub of our \nsmall community when my wife Liz and I settled there in 1963.\n  Run by the four Pierce siblings, Marjorie, Glendon, Marion and \nGordon, the store was the place to go for a neighborly chat as much as \nfor your milk and butter.\n  Children would get off the bus to buy their penny candy. Glendon \nPierce could tell a great tale, and the political banter was endless.\n  With its antique cash register and woodstove, this was the \nquintessential general store.\n  Unfortunately, the Pierce Store closed its doors some years back and \nShrewsbury lost a vital part of its identity.\n  There has been a recent attempt to revive the store, and I hope, for \nthe sake of my community, it proves successful.\n  Despite their small relative size and market share, historic country \nstores have demonstrated incredible resiliency, surviving floods and \nfires, overcoming economic downturns, and reformulating their \ninventories to meet modern needs.\n  According to the Vermont Grocers' Association, country stores account \nfor an estimated $55 million annually in retail sales in Vermont.\n  Nonetheless, competition from larger chain stores continues to \nincrease.\n  When coupled with the additional cost and expertise required to \nmaintain their aging structures and external facades, today's remaining \ncountry stores are hard-pressed to overcome these unprecedented \nchallenges.\n  In Vermont, a handful of historic country stores close each year and \nthe cumulative impact of those losses is experienced throughout the \nState.\n  The National Trust for Historic Preservation has listed the entire \nState of Vermont among America's ``Eleven Most Endangered Places,''\n  That is due to the threat that large-scale development poses to \nVermont's small, independent retailers.\n  Yet country stores remain fixtures of Vermont's landscape. The \nVermont Alliance of Independent Country Stores estimates that more than \n115 historic country stores are scattered about the State.\n  Across the country, thousands of these establishments help to define \nthe character of rural life.\n  These country stores draw local customers and tourists alike, \noffering convenient access to newspapers, groceries and local specialty \nfoods in a typically neighborly atmosphere.\n  Many stores also double as local post offices or outdoor camping and \nhome hardware goods suppliers. It is not unusual, and highly \nrecommended, that customers buy a fresh whole wedge of cheddar cheese \nfrom a 38-pound wheel next to the cash register.\n  Fathers can buy earthworms and tackle and take their daughters to the \nnearby fishing hole for an afternoon excursion.\n  The National Historic Country Store Preservation Act of 2005 is \ndesigned to build upon the momentum that country store preservation \nwork has generated in Vermont and to gather useful models and \ninformation to develop a program that supports historic, rural country \nstores nationwide.\n  My legislation authorizes the U.S. Economic Development \nAdministration to make grants to national, State\n\n[[Page S5074]]\n\nand local agencies and non-profit organizations to support historic \ncountry store preservation efforts.\n  The bill promotes the study of best practices for preserving \nstructures, improving profitability and promoting collaboration among \ncountry store proprietors.\n  In addition, the bill establishes a revolving loan fund. The fund \nwill be used for research and restoration work.\n  It will be used to improve our understanding of existing needs and \nprovide the assistance required to address them.\n  This bill seeks to sustain America's rural heritage by uniting small \nbusiness development and historic preservation.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in my efforts to protect our \nNation's historic country stores and revitalize our rural communities.\n  I ask that a summary of the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1011\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, the Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to protect consumers in managed care plans and other health \ncoverage; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is time for a new effort in Congress \nto enact the Patients' Bill of Rights. The Senate has approved major \nbipartisan legislation to end the abuses of managed care and HMOs \nbefore, but final enactment of this important measure was blocked by \nthe HMOs and the vested interests of the corporate world that deny \nworking Americans their basic rights and a needed voice in challenging \ndecisions that deny them basic medical care. It was blocked too by an \nadministration that professes to support patients' rights, but does all \nit can to block legislation to guarantee those rights.\n  Despite our outstanding researchers and professionals, families \nacross the country are overwhelmingly and justifiably concerned that \nmedical decisions are too often made by insurance industry accountants, \nand not their doctors. HMO profits too often take priority over patient \nneeds. It is time for Congress to end the abuses of patients and \nphysicians by HMOs and the insurance industry. Too often, managed care \nis mismanaged care. No amount of distortions or smokescreens by \ninsurance companies can change the facts.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. For millions of \nAmericans who rely on health insurance to protect them when serious \nillness strikes, the Patients' Bill of Rights is literally a matter of \nlife and death.\n  It's important to remember what this debate is really about. It's not \nabout lawyers. It's not about insurance companies. It's about \npatients--mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, sisters and \nbrothers. It's about families around the country who will someday face \nthe challenge of serious illness and deserve the best in health care--\nthe same care that all members of the Senate want for ourselves and our \nloved ones. But too many families are denied the care they need and \ndeserve because of abuses by HMOs and other insurance companies.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will end those abuses. \nSeveral of its provisions are especially important--specialty care, \nclinical trials, and prescription drugs.\n  In each of these areas, care is too often delayed or denied by \ninsurance companies more interested in profits than patients. Access to \nspecialty care for serious and complex illnesses is a critical element \nof good health care. Yet denial of needed specialists is one of the \nmost common abuses in the current system.\n  Patients with cancer and other serious illnesses need specialty care. \nOften, their best hope for a cure or for precious extra years of life \nis participation in a clinical trial. But too often, both are lacking. \nPatients with cancer or other serious illnesses and their physicians \nmust fight HMOs to take advantage of this opportunity.\n  Traditionally, insurance companies have paid for the routine costs of \ndoctors and hospitals in clinical trials. But HMOs frequently refuse to \ndo so, with devastating effects on patients and research alike. Our \nlegislation will end this abuse.\n  Another abuse that will be ended by our plan is the denial of \nmedically necessary drugs not on an HMO plan's list. One group that \nsuffers from this denial is the mentally ill. Some of the most dramatic \nadvances in medicine in recent years have been the development of \neffective drugs to treat persons with serious mental illness. Too \noften, however, they're told to settle for older, cheaper, less \neffective drugs with harmful side effects, because an HMO refuses to \npay for the best standard of care.\n  Our legislation guarantees that patients can get medically necessary \ndrugs, even if they are not on the HMO's list. Equally important, our \nbill guarantees that these drugs will be provided at a cost no greater \nthan the normal cost-sharing for other medications. Access to needed \ndrugs is a concern for every family, particularly when new cures are \nincreasingly based on new drugs today.\n  The list of abuses goes on and on. People across the country know \nthese abuses are wrong. Managed care practices that cause these \ntragedies cost lives, and ending these abuses is a matter of simple \njustice and common decency.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights will protect families from insurance \ncompany bureaucracies that rob them of their peace of mind, their \nhealth, or even their lives. The bill is a guarantee that medical \ndecisions will be made by doctors and patients, not managed care \naccountants. It is actively supported by doctors, nurses, patients, \nsmall businesses, religious organizations, and working families. The \nsupport is impressive in its breadth, its depth and its diversity.\n  It is time to guarantee these basic rights for patients. It is time \nfor Congress to pass this bill. Every doctor knows it. Every nurse \nknows it. Every patient knows it. And every Senator knows it too.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1012\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Such \n     criteria shall include written clinical review criteria that \n     are based on valid clinical evidence where available and that \n     are directed specifically at meeting the needs of at-risk \n     populations and covered individuals with chronic conditions \n     or severe illnesses, including gender-specific criteria and \n     pediatric-specific criteria where available and appropriate.\n       (B) Continuing use of standards in retrospective review.--\n     If a health care service has been specifically pre-authorized \n     or approved for a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee under \n     such a program, the program shall not, pursuant to \n     retrospective review, revise or modify the specific \n     standards, criteria, or procedures used for the utilization \n     review for procedures, treatment, and services delivered to \n     the enrollee during the same course of treatment.\n       (C) Review of sample of claims denials.--Such a program \n     shall provide for a periodic evaluation of the clinical \n     appropriateness of at least a sample of denials of claims for \n     benefits.\n       (c) Conduct of Program Activities.--\n       (1) Administration by health care professionals.--A \n     utilization review program shall be administered by qualified \n     health care professionals who shall oversee review decisions.\n       (2) Use of qualified, independent personnel.--\n       (A) In general.--A utilization review program shall provide \n     for the conduct of utilization review activities only through \n     personnel who are qualified and have received appropriate \n     training in the conduct of such activities under the program.\n       (B) Prohibition of contingent compensation arrangements.--\n     Such a program shall not, with respect to utilization review \n     activities, permit or provide compensation or anything of \n     value to its employees, agents, or contractors in a manner \n     that encourages denials of claims for benefits.\n       (C) Prohibition of conflicts.--Such a program shall not \n     permit a health care professional who is providing health \n     care services to an individual to perform utilization review \n     activities in connection with the health care services being \n     provided to the individual.\n       (3) Accessibility of review.--Such a program shall provide \n     that appropriate personnel performing utilization review \n     activities under the program, including the utilization \n     review administrator, are reasonably accessible by toll-free \n     telephone during normal business hours to discuss patient \n     care and allow response to telephone requests, and that \n     appropriate provision is made to receive and respond promptly \n     to calls received during other hours.\n       (4) Limits on frequency.--Such a program shall not provide \n     for the performance of utilization review activities with \n     respect to a class of services furnished to an individual \n     more frequently than is reasonably required to assess whether \n     the services under review are medically necessary and \n     appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 102. PROCEDURES FOR INITIAL CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS AND \n                   PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DETERMINATIONS.\n\n       (a) Procedures of Initial Claims for Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--A group health plan, and a health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall--\n       (A) make a determination on an initial claim for benefits \n     by a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) regarding payment or coverage for items or \n     services under the terms and conditions of the plan or \n     coverage involved, including any cost-sharing amount that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is required to pay with \n     respect to such claim for benefits; and\n       (B) notify a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional involved regarding a determination on an initial \n     claim for benefits made under the terms and conditions of the \n     plan or coverage, including any cost-sharing amounts that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee may be required to make \n     with respect to such claim for benefits, and of the right of \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to an internal \n     appeal under section 103.\n       (2) Access to information.--\n       (A) Timely provision of necessary information.--With \n     respect to an initial claim for benefits, the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) and \n     the treating health care professional (if any) shall provide \n     the plan or issuer with access to information requested by \n     the plan or issuer that is necessary to make a determination \n     relating to the claim. Such access shall be provided not \n     later than 5 days after the date on which the request for \n     information is received, or, in a case described in \n     subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(1), by such earlier \n     time as may be necessary to comply with the applicable \n     timeline under such subparagraph.\n       (B) Limited effect of failure on plan or issuer's \n     obligations.--Failure of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) \n     shall not remove the obligation of the plan or issuer to make \n     a decision in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, based on the available \n     information, and failure to comply with the time limit \n     established by this paragraph shall not remove the obligation \n     of the plan or issuer to comply with the requirements of this \n     section.\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\n       (3) Oral requests.--In the case of a claim for benefits \n     involving an expedited or concurrent determination, a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) may make an initial claim for benefits \n     orally, but a group health plan, or health insurance issuer \n     offering health insurance coverage, may require that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) provide written confirmation of such request \n     in a timely manner on a form provided by the plan or issuer. \n     In the case of such an oral request for benefits, the making \n     of the request (and the timing of such request) shall be \n     treated as the making at that time of a claim for such \n     benefits without regard to whether and when a written \n     confirmation of such request is made.\n       (b) Timeline for Making Determinations.--\n       (1) Prior authorization determination.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, and a health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall \n     make a prior authorization determination on a claim for \n     benefits (whether oral or written) in accordance with the \n     medical exigencies of the case and as soon as possible, but \n     in no case later than 14 days from the date on which the plan \n     or issuer receives information that is reasonably necessary \n     to enable the plan or issuer to make a determination on the \n     request for prior authorization and in no case later than 28 \n     days after the date of the claim for benefits is received.\n       (B) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n     (A), a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer \n     offering health insurance coverage, shall expedite a prior \n     authorization determination on a claim for benefits described \n     in such subparagraph when a request for such an expedited \n     determination is made by a participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) at any time during \n     the process for making a determination and a health care \n     professional certifies, with the request, that a \n     determination under the procedures described in subparagraph \n     (A) would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee or the ability of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to maintain or regain \n     maximum function. Such determination shall be made in \n     accordance with the medical exigencies of the case and as \n     soon as possible, but in no case later than 72 hours after \n     the time the request is received by the plan or issuer under \n     this subparagraph.\n       (C) Ongoing care.--\n       (i) Concurrent review.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in the case of a \n     concurrent review of ongoing care (including \n     hospitalization), which results in a termination or reduction \n     of such care, the plan or issuer must provide by telephone \n     and in printed form notice of the concurrent review \n     determination to the individual or the individual's designee \n     and the individual's health care provider in accordance with \n     the medical exigencies of the case and as soon as possible, \n     with sufficient time prior to the termination or reduction to \n     allow for an appeal under section 103(b)(3) to be completed \n     before the termination or reduction takes effect.\n       (II) Contents of notice.--Such notice shall include, with \n     respect to ongoing health care items and services, the number \n     of ongoing services approved, the new total of approved \n     services, the date of onset of services, and the next review \n     date, if any, as well as a statement of the individual's \n     rights to further appeal.\n\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--Clause (i) shall not be \n     construed as requiring plans or issuers to provide coverage \n     of care that would exceed the coverage limitations for such \n     care.\n       (2) Retrospective determination.--A group health plan, and \n     a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall make a retrospective determination on a claim for \n     benefits in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but not later than 30 days \n     after the date on which the plan or issuer receives \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the plan \n     or issuer to make a determination on the claim, or, if \n     earlier, 60 days after the date of receipt of the claim for \n     benefits.\n       (c) Notice of a Denial of a Claim for Benefits.--Written \n     notice of a denial made under an initial claim for benefits \n     shall be issued to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than 2 \n     days after the date of the determination (or, in the case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(1), \n     within the 72-hour or applicable period referred to in such \n     subparagraph).\n       (d) Requirements of Notice of Determinations.--The written \n     notice of a denial of a claim for benefits determination \n     under subsection (c) shall be provided in printed form and \n     written in a manner calculated to be understood by the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and shall include--\n       (1) the specific reasons for the determination (including a \n     summary of the clinical or scientific evidence used in making \n     the determination);\n       (2) the procedures for obtaining additional information \n     concerning the determination;

INTERNAL APPEALS OF CLAIMS DENIALS.\n\n       (a) Right to Internal Appeal.--\n       (1) In general.--A participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) may appeal any denial of a \n     claim for benefits under section 102 under the procedures \n     described in this section.\n       (2) Time for appeal.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, and a health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall \n     ensure that a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) has a period of not less than 180 \n     days beginning on the date of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under section 102 in which to appeal such denial \n     under this section.\n       (B) Date of denial.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     date of the denial shall be deemed to be the date as of which \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee knew of the denial \n     of the claim for benefits.\n       (3) Failure to act.--The failure of a plan or issuer to \n     issue a determination on a claim for benefits under section \n     102 within the applicable timeline established for such a \n     determination under such section is a denial of a claim for \n     benefits for purposes this subtitle as of the date of the \n     applicable deadline.\n       (4) Plan waiver of internal review.--A group health plan, \n     or health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage, may waive the internal review process under this \n     section. In such case the plan or issuer shall provide notice \n     to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) involved, the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) involved shall be \n     relieved of any obligation to complete the internal review \n     involved, and may, at the option of such participant, \n     beneficiary, enrollee, or representative proceed directly to \n     seek further appeal through external review under section 104 \n     or otherwise.\n       (b) Timelines for Making Determinations.--\n       (1) Oral requests.--In the case of an appeal of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits under this section that involves an \n     expedited or concurrent determination, a participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) may \n     request such appeal orally. A group health plan, or health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, may \n     require that the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) provide written confirmation of \n     such request in a timely manner on a form provided by the \n     plan or issuer. In the case of such an oral request for an \n     appeal of a denial, the making of the request (and the timing \n     of such request) shall be treated as the making at that time \n     of a request for an appeal without regard to whether and when \n     a written confirmation of such request is made.\n       (2) Access to information.--\n       (A) Timely provision of necessary information.--With \n     respect to an appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits, the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) and the treating health care professional (if \n     any) shall provide the plan or issuer with access to \n     information requested by the plan or issuer that is necessary \n     to make a determination relating to the appeal.

Such \n     notice--\n\n       (I) shall be written (and, in addition, may be provided \n     orally) in a manner calculated to be understood by a \n     participant or enrollee;\n       (II) shall include the reasons for the determination;\n       (III) include any relevant terms and conditions of the plan \n     or coverage; and\n       (IV) include a description of any further recourse \n

the entity \n     determines that a referral to an independent medical reviewer \n     is not required, the entity shall provide notice of such \n     determination to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) within such timeline and \n     within 2 days of the date of such determination.\n       (d) Independent Medical Review.--\n       (1) In general.--If a qualified external review entity \n     determines under subsection (c) that a denial of a claim for \n     benefits is eligible for independent medical review, the \n     entity shall refer the denial involved to an independent \n     medical reviewer for the conduct of an independent medical \n     review under this subsection.\n       (2) Medically reviewable decisions.--A denial of a claim \n     for benefits is eligible for independent medical review if \n     the benefit for the item or service for which the claim is \n     made would be a covered benefit under the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage but for one (or more) of \n     the following determinations:\n       (A) Denials based on medical necessity and \n     appropriateness.--A determination that the item or service is \n     not covered because it is not medically necessary and \n     appropriate or based on the application of substantially \n     equivalent terms.\n       (B) Denials based on

service or condition.\n       (3) Independent medical review determination.--\n       (A) In general.--An independent medical reviewer under this \n     section shall make a new independent determination with \n     respect to whether or not the denial of a claim for a benefit \n     that is the subject of the review should be upheld, reversed, \n     or modified.\n       (B) Standard for determination.--The independent medical \n     reviewer's determination relating to the medical necessity \n     and appropriateness, or the experimental or investigational \n     nature, or the evaluation of the medical facts, of the item, \n     service, or condition involved shall be based on the medical \n     condition of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (including the medical records of the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee) and valid, relevant scientific \n     evidence and clinical evidence, including peer-reviewed \n     medical literature or findings and including expert opinion.\n       (C) No coverage for excluded benefits.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to permit an independent \n     medical reviewer to require that a

limited under the plan or \n     coverage in the plain language of the plan document (and \n     which are disclosed under section 121(b)(1)(C)). \n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any \n     exclusion of an exact medical procedure, any exact time limit \n     on the duration or frequency of coverage, and any exact \n     dollar limit on the amount of coverage that is specifically \n     enumerated and defined (in the plain language of the plan or \n     coverage documents) under the plan or coverage offered by a \n     group health plan or health insurance issuer offering health \n     insurance coverage and that is disclosed under section \n     121(b)(1) shall be considered to govern the scope of the \n     benefits that may be required: Provided, That the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage relating to such an \n     exclusion or limit are in compliance with the requirements of \n     law.\n       (D) Evidence and information to be used in medical \n     reviews.--In making a determination under this subsection, \n     the independent medical reviewer shall also consider \n     appropriate and available evidence and information, including \n     the following:\n       (i) The determination made by the plan or issuer with \n     respect to the claim upon internal review and the evidence, \n     guidelines, or rationale used by the plan or issuer in \n     reaching such determination.\n       (ii) The recommendation of the treating health care \n     professional and the evidence, guidelines, and rationale used \n     by the treating health care professional in reaching such \n     recommendation.\n       (iii) Additional relevant evidence or information obtained \n     by the reviewer or submitted by the plan, issuer, \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or an authorized \n     representative), or treating health care professional.\n       (iv) The plan or coverage document.\n       (E) Independent determination.--In making determinations \n     under this section, a qualified external review entity and an \n     independent medical reviewer shall--\n       (i) consider the claim under review without deference to \n     the determinations made by the plan or issuer or the \n     recommendation of the treating health care professional (if \n     any); and\n       (ii) consider, but not be bound by, the definition used by \n     the plan or issuer of ``medically necessary and \n     appropriate'', or ``experimental or investigational'', or \n     other substantially equivalent terms that are used by the \n     plan or issuer to describe medical necessity and \n     appropriateness or experimental or investigational nature of \n     the treatment.\n       (F) Determination of independent medical reviewer.--An \n     independent medical reviewer shall, in accordance with the \n     deadlines described in subsection (e), prepare a written \n     determination to uphold, reverse, or modify the denial under \n     review.

Nothing in this \n     paragraph shall be construed as preventing an entity or \n     reviewer from providing an initial oral notice of the \n     reviewer's determination.\n       (3) Form of notices.--Determinations and notices under this \n     subsection shall be written in a manner calculated to be \n     understood by a participant.\n       (f) Compliance.--\n       (1) Application of determinations.--\n       (A) External review determinations binding on plan.--The \n     determinations of an external review entity and an \n     independent medical reviewer under this section

person referred to in such subparagraph has taken an action \n     resulting in a refusal of a benefit determined by an external \n     appeal entity to be covered, or has failed to take an action \n     for which such person is responsible under the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage and which is necessary \n     under the plan or coverage for authorizing a benefit, the \n

For purposes of this \n     subparagraph, a health care professional is reasonably \n     expected to know of internal procedures if those procedures \n     have been made available to the professional through \n     distribution or posting.\n       (C) Internal procedure exception.--Subparagraph (D) of \n     paragraph (2) also shall not apply if--\n       (i) the disclosure relates to an imminent hazard of loss of \n     life or serious injury to a patient;\n       (ii) the disclosure is made to an appropriate private \n     accreditation body pursuant to disclosure procedures \n     established by the body; or\n       (iii) the disclosure is in response to an inquiry made in \n     an investigation or proceeding of an appropriate public \n     regulatory agency and the information disclosed is limited to \n     the scope of the investigation or proceeding.\n       (4) Additional considerations.--It shall not be a violation \n     of paragraph (1) to take an adverse action against a \n     protected health care professional if the plan, issuer, or \n     provider taking the adverse action involved demonstrates that \n     it would have taken the same adverse action even in the \n     absence of the activities protected under such paragraph.\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\n       (5) Notice.--A group health plan, health insurance issuer, \n     and institutional health care provider shall post a notice, \n     to be provided or approved by the Secretary of Labor, setting \n     forth excerpts from, or summaries of, the pertinent \n     provisions of this subsection and information pertaining to \n     enforcement of such provisions.\n       (6) Constructions.--\n       (A) Determinations of coverage.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to prohibit a plan or issuer from making a \n     determination not to pay for a particular medical treatment \n     or service or the services of a type of health care \n     professional.\n       (B) Enforcement of peer review protocols and internal \n     procedures.--Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to \n     prohibit a plan, issuer, or provider from establishing and \n     enforcing reasonable peer review or utilization review \n     protocols or determining whether a protected health care \n     professional has complied with those protocols or from \n     establishing and enforcing internal procedures for the \n     purpose of addressing quality concerns.\n       (C) Relation to other rights.--Nothing in this subsection \n     shall be construed to abridge rights of participants, \n     beneficiaries, enrollees, and protected health care \n     professionals under other applicable Federal or State laws.\n       (7) Protected health care professional defined.--For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``protected health care \n     professional'' means an individual who is a licensed or \n     certified health care professional and who--\n       (A) with respect to a group health plan or health insurance \n     issuer, is an employee of the plan or issuer or has a \n     contract with the plan or issuer for provision of services \n     for which benefits are available under the plan or issuer; or\n       (B) with respect to an institutional health care provider, \n     is an employee of the provider or has a contract or other \n     arrangement with the provider respecting the provision of \n     health care services.\n\n                        Subtitle E--Definitions\n\n     SEC. 151.

A bill to improve the allocation of grants through the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Homeland \nSecurity FORWARD Funding Act of 2005. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator John Cornyn, as well as Senators \nLautenberg, Hutchison, Boxer, Corzine, Schumer, Clinton and Senator \nNelson of Florida.\n  It is time that Congress ensures that funding to bolster the security \nof our nation goes to where the threat is the greatest.\n  Unfortunately, billions of dollars in homeland security funds to \nstates and local communities--including $3.6 billion in fiscal year \n2005--are now being distributed to areas that are not at the greatest \nrisk of terrorist attack.\n  To do this, we need to adopt risk-based analysis to determine where \nour homeland security funding goes, rather than continue with the \npresent system of ad hoc determinations, ``small-state minimums'' and \npoorly understood decision-making, that leave some targets exposed to \nthreats while sending resources to places where there is little chance \nof terrorist attack.\n  This legislation will ensure that priorities are set according to \nanalysis of risk and threat. Specifically it directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to allocate funding to homeland security grants based \non risk analysis.\n  This is the core of the bill, and I believe it is so important that I \nwill quote in full the operative language, which appears in the very \nfirst substantive section of the legislation: ``The Secretary shall \nensure that homeland security grants are allocated based on an \nassessment of threat, vulnerability, and consequence to the maximum \nextent practicable.''\n  This direction covers the four major first-responder grant programs \nadministered by Department of Homeland Security in addition to grants \nfor seaport and airport security--called ``covered grants'' in the \nbill, including: 1. the State Homeland Security Grant Program; 2. the \nUrban Area Security Initiative; 3. the Law Enforcement Terrorism \nPrevention Program; and 4. the Citizens Corps Program.\n  Reduces the ``small state minimum'' to 25 percent per State. Current \npractice requires each state to get .75 percent of much of the grant \nfunding. That means 37.5 percent of the funds are marked for \ndistribution before any risk analysis.\n  Requires grants be designed to meet ``essential capabilities.'' \nEssential capabilities are what we get for the money spent--the ability \nto address the risk by reducing vulnerability to attack and by \ndiminishing the consequences of such an attack by effective response.\n  Ensures that States quickly and effectively pass on Federal funds to \nwhere they are needed so that Federal funds are not held back.\n  The bottom line is this: if Federal funds are going to be distributed \nto improve our national ability to ``prevent, prepare for, respond to, \nor mitigate threatened or actual terrorist attacks,'' those funds \nshould be distributed in accordance with a risk-based analysis.\n  In this post-Cold War world of asymmetric threat there are two \nfundamental principles we should apply to efforts to make our nation \nmore secure against a terrorist attack: the first is that understanding \nand predicting what terrorists will do requires risk analysis.\n  It is an uncomfortable fact that, even with the best intelligence, we \nwill never know exactly how, when and where terrorists will strike--the \nbest we can do is try to assess risks and threats, and make \npredictions.\n  The second principle is that our defense resources are finite.\n  The total amount of money, time and personnel that can be devoted to \nhomeland security is limited. That means tough choices have to be made \nby both the Congress, and by Executive Branch officials at the Federal, \nState and Local level.\n  Together these two principles define what we need to do for our \nNation: accurately assess the risks of an array of possible terrorist \nattacks; measure the vulnerability of all of these possible targets, \nand then allocate our resources based on that assessment.\n  Three years ago, we created the Department of Homeland Security in an\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\neffort to create an institution that could perform this task.\n  The core element of the new Department was to be the Information \nAssessment and Infrastructure Protection Directorate, which would \n``merge under one roof the capability to identify and assess current \nand future threats to the homeland, map those threats against our \nvulnerabilities, issue timely warnings and take preventive and \nprotective action.''\n  We are failing in this effort.\n  The 9/11 Commission agreed, finding that ``nothing has been harder \nfor officials--executive or legislative than to set priorities, making \nhard choices in allocating limited resources.''\n  The Commission concluded, ``Homeland security assistance should be \nbased strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities.''\n  This bill does just that.\n  The New York Times, an editorial published last month, titled ``Real \nSecurity, or Politics as Usual?'' agreed:\n\n       Any terrorist who has followed how domestic security money \n     is distributed in this country must be encouraged by the \n     government's ineptness . . . The current formula is based in \n     part on population, rather than risk, and contains state \n     minimums, so even sparsely populated states that hardly have \n     a plausible terrorism target are raking in money. This is the \n     formula that gave Wyoming seven times more domestic security \n     money per capita than New York . . . If there were a \n     successful attack on Wall Street or the ports of Los Angeles \n     and Long Beach, it would be a blow to the whole nation. \n     Defending places where the terrorist threat is greatest is \n     not parochialism; it is defending America.\n\n  Despite these recommendations, we find again and again that scarce \nresources are allocated based on factors unrelated to real security.\n  For instance, Congress has established a ``small State minimum'' \ndesigned to ensure that every State gets a substantial portion of \nscarce resources, regardless of the measure of risk or vulnerability.\n  As a result, in fiscal year 2004 Wyoming spent $37.52 per capita with \nhomeland security grants, while California and Texas spent $8.75 and \n$6.93 respectively.\n  The problem is not just in Congress. For example, a recent Department \nof Homeland Security Inspector General's report found that in the \ncritical area of port security, grants are ``not well coordinated with \nthe Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection.''\n  The result is the ``funding of projects with low [risk and \nvulnerability] scores.''\n  A recently issued report from the Center for Security Studies and the \nHeritage Foundation found that there is:\n\n     no funding formula that is based on risk analysis and \n     divorced from politics . . . [w]ith only limited resources \n     available to achieve the almost limitless goal of protecting \n     the entire United States . . . it is critical that we set \n     priorities.\n\n  This bill is a first step to reducing threats of terrorist attack, \nbut Congress can not do it alone.\n  The Department of Homeland Security must embrace not only the concept \nof risk-based allocation, but also the practical aspects of the \ndiscipline. That means improving the intelligence analysis and \nvulnerability assessment functions of the Department.\n  We also need to follow through on last year's intelligence reform \nefforts, since the product of the Intelligence Community--analysis of \nthe plans, intentions and capabilities of terrorist groups--is the key \nelement in an effective risk analysis.\n  This will not be easy. There are lots of vested interests who will \noppose such efforts. But our nation's safety is at sake. It is time to \nput aside pork-barrel politics and a Cold War mentality and get to \nwork.\n  Last year Representatives Cox and Turner, the Chair and Ranking \nMember, respectively, of the other body's Homeland Security Committee \nput forth similar legislation.\n  That effort passed the House of Representatives as part of the \nIntelligence Reform Bill, but was dropped at conference--that bill has \nbeen reintroduced, and is scheduled for consideration on the floor of \nthe House this week.\n  This bill is based on Chairman Cox's efforts, and with a few \nexceptions tracks it closely.\n  However, unlike the House bill, this bill makes an across-the-board \nreduction of the small-State minimum to .25 percent--the House bill \nretains a sliding scale that I believe will have the effect of \nundercutting its risk-based approach.\n  In this body, Senators Collins and Lieberman have been working to \ncraft risk-based legislation, which was recently reported favorably by \nthe Senate Homeland Security Committee.\n  I hope that the bill introduced today will be accepted by Senators \nCollins and Lieberman in the spirit in which it was drafted--as a \nreasoned alternative to their approach, and as a starting point for \nfurther discussions.\n  It is my hope that Congress will act quickly to pass this \nlegislation. We cannot afford to wait until it is too late.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague, \nSenator Dianne Feinstein of California and other of our distinguished \ncolleagues in introducing The Homeland Security FORWARD Funding Act of \n2005.\n  I would like to thank Senator Feinstein for her collaboration in \ncrafting this legislation. I know that she has thoughtfully examined \nthe current state of our Homeland Security Funding and the many other \ninterrelated issues, and I thank her for her fine leadership as we work \ntogether exploring ways to better protect our country.\n  We say it often, and it is true: ``9/11 changed everything.'' The \nattacks of that day were unprecedented in our history, and they brought \nwith them the need for similarly unprecedented security measures. In an \neffort to respond quickly to the devastation that was wrought upon our \ncountry, the Federal Government created a system that worked to raise \noverall national emergency preparedness to ensure we could better guard \nagainst another such terrorist attack.\n  And so we embarked on the task of shoring up our airline, \ntransportation, border, and port security. We worked to protect our \ncritical infrastructure, to protect our cyber security, our agriculture \nand food supply systems.\n  But taxpayer dollars are not limitless, and Congress must work to \nensure every penny be directed where it will do the most good. It is \nimperative that we guard the places across our nation where terrorists \nmay strike and where such strikes could do the most damage to our \npeople, our government, and our national economy. We believe this is \nthe most responsible way to prepare for any future terrorist attack.\n  We need to have a system that will protect our most vulnerable \npopulation centers, and that recognizes the need to protect the \ncritical infrastructure and vital components of our national economy. I \nam reminded of a recent tour I took of several Texas seaports. I \nvisited with port directors, industry leaders, and emergency responders \nin and around the ports of Houston, Beaumont, and Corpus Christi. They \nhave enormous security needs and the consequences of a terrorist attack \non any of these facilities would be devastating, not only to the local \ncommunities, but to the economic engine of the whole country.\n  The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I now propose would \nrequire that Federal Homeland Security funds be allocated to states \naccording to a risk-based assessment. It is vital that we better \nallocate our limited resources to the vulnerable places in the country \nwe most need to protect, and that that these funds are distributed in \nan efficient and timely manner.\n  Senator Feinstein and I have evaluated the 9/11 Commission \nrecommendations that call for allocation of money based on \nvulnerabilities, and our legislation provides for a distribution \nformula for homeland security grants based on three main criteria: \nThreat, vulnerability, and consequence. This would require states to \nquickly pass on federal funds to where they are most needed. This bill \nis inspired by the hard work and examination done on this issue by our \ncolleagues in the House and Senate. We have also taken input from \nstakeholders in our respective States and from across the country. It \nis our hope and intention that by introducing this bill we can \ncontribute and enrich the public discourse on this critical issue and \nhelp move the Nation toward a more rational and effective distribution \nof our homeland security resources.\n  Key provisions of this bill include: establishing a First Responder \nGrant Board, consisting of Department of\n\n[[Page S5101]]\n\nHomeland Security leadership, that will rank and prioritize grant \napplications based on threat and vulnerability. Enabling a region that \nencompasses more than one State to apply for funds. The money would \nstill pass through the States, but would go to the region to better \nenable coordination and planning. Provides greater flexibility in using \nthe funds, allowing a State to use them for other hazards consistent \nwith federally established capability standards. And it allows States \nto retain authority to administer grant programs, but there are \npenalties for States that do not pass funds to local governments within \n45 days, and if a State fails to pass the funds through, local \ngovernments may petition the Department of Homeland Security to receive \nthe funds directly.\n  Continuing to spread Homeland Security funds throughout the Nation \nirrespective of the actual risk to particular States and communities \nwould be to ignore much of what we have learned as part of our effort \nto assess our vulnerabilities since the attacks of September 11. So I \nwould urge that we swiftly work to pass this legislation, to better \nensure the safety of our citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1014. A bill to provide additional relief for small business \nowners ordered to active duty as members of reserve components of the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the Supporting Our \nPatriotic Businesses Act. This bill addresses some key concerns I have \nregarding the impact that military call-ups have on our Nation's small \nbusinesses.\n  Today, I am offering my legislation in conjunction with the release \nof a Congressional Budget Office Report entitled ``The Impact of \nReserve Call-ups on Civilian Employers.'' I commissioned the Report a \nyear and a half ago, because I believed then, as I do now, that our \ncountry is not doing enough for the patriotic small businesses that are \nowned by or employ our Guard and Reserve members; and which are \nnegatively effected when these workers are called up in defense of our \nNation.\n  Although I am still analyzing the Report, three key findings \nimmediately caught my attention. For instance, the Report concludes \nthat: 1. Thirty-five percent of Guard and Reserve members work for \nsmall businesses or are self-employed, twenty-six percent work for \nlarge businesses, thirty-six percent work for the government, Federal, \nState, or local, and the remainder work for non-profit organizations. \nTherefore, the majority of non-government employed Guard and Reserve \nmembers are either self-employed, or work for small businesses. 2. Over \nthe past decade, the military has dramatically increased its reliance \non Guard and Reserve forces. This trend has accelerated since the \nterrorism attacks of September 11, 2001. Guard and Reserve members make \nup about thirty-three percent of deployed service members supporting \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 3. I am particularly troubled by a \nthird finding which confirms what I have feared all along--that the \nself-employed, and the small businesses that employ Guard and Reserve \nmembers, may be ``paying'' a disproportionate and unfair share of the \nburden of increased Guard and Reserve member call-ups. The burden is \nfurther magnified when it is the small business owner, or a key \nemployee, who is deployed.\n  As members of this institution charged with the duty of preserving \nthe public trust, we should work together, on a bipartisan basis, to \nhelp diminish the unfair burden these employers and self-employed \nbusinesses shoulder.\n  It is difficult enough to leave friends and family behind and enter \nharm's way, but asking our military personnel to also jeopardize their \nlivelihood is unconscionable. By assisting these businesses and the \nself-employed, we are helping to diminish important concerns of our \nmilitary personnel, improving their morale and positively affecting \nretention.\n  The legislation that I offer today contains multiple provisions in \nsupport of self-employed Guard and Reserve members and the patriotic \nbusinesses that employ Guard and Reserve members.\n  First, it authorizes increased appropriations for the Small Business \nAdministration's (SBA) Office of Veteran Business Development, which \noffers vital services to our Nation's small businesses that are owned \nor employ our veterans. For instance, the office has prepared and \ndistributed pre- and post-mobilization packets for small businesses, \noffers loans, and provides targeted business advice to meet the needs \nof our veterans and small businesses.\n  My bill permanently extends the authority and duties of the SBA's \nAdvisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs, which has served as an \ninvaluable independent source of advice and policy on veterans' \nbusiness issues.\n  My legislation provides that a service member does not need to \nsatisfy any continuing education requirements, imposed with respect to \ntheir profession or occupation, while they are called up, or within the \n120-day period after they are released from the call-up.\n  I have also included a provision which amends the Small Business Act \nby allowing small businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled \nveterans to extend their SBA program participation time limitations by \nthe length of time that their owners are called up in defense of our \nNation. Currently, small business owners who are called up to active \nduty in the Guard or Reserve are effectively penalized for serving \nbecause their active duty time is counted against the time limitations \non participation of the Small Business Administration's programs.\n  Finally, my bill requires that the Department of Defense take \nmeasures to counsel Guard and Reserve members concerning the importance \nof notifying their employers in a timely manner after they receive \nOrders that they will be called up to active duty. The legislation \nfurther requires that the DoD investigate ways to diminish the lag \nbetween the time when military personnel are notified of their call-up \nand the time that military personnel notify their employers.\n  Enacting this legislation is an important first step in the right \ndirection toward assisting the brave men and women who serve in our \nGuard and Reserve and the businesses that employ them. However, I \nrealize that this legislation is merely one of many steps that can and \nshould be taken to this end and welcome new ideas to help this \nconstituency.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill, and to \ncontinue to work with me, as well as veterans, policymakers, \nbusinesses, and others, to find additional solutions to address these \nvital issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and that a section-\nby-section summary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to discuss this pressing \nmatter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1014\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting Our Patriotic \n     Businesses Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From September 2001 through November 2004, \n     approximately 410,000 members of the reserve components of \n     the Armed Forces, including the National Guard and Reserves, \n     have been mobilized in support of United States military \n     operations.\n       (2) According to 2004 data from the Manpower Data Center of \n     the Department of Defense, an estimated 35 percent of Guard \n     members and Reservists are either self-employed or own or are \n     employed by a small business.\n       (3) The majority of privately employed National Guard and \n     Reserve members either work for a small business or are self-\n     employed.\n       (4) As a result of activations, many small businesses have \n     been forced to go without their owners and key personnel for \n     months, and sometimes years, on end.\n       (5) The effects have been devastating to such patriotic \n     small businesses.\n       (6) The Office of Veterans Business Development of the \n     Small Business Administration has made a concerted effort to \n     reach out to small businesses affected by deployments, but \n     given the sheer numbers of those deployed, their resources \n     have been stretched thin.\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\n       (7) In addition, the Office of Veterans Business \n     Development has been required to broaden its delivery of \n     services, as directed by Executive Order 13360, to provide \n     procurement training programs for service-disabled veterans.\n       (8) This Act will help to stem the effects of National \n     Guard and Reservist deployments on small businesses, and \n     better assist veterans and service-disabled veterans with \n     their business needs.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE OFFICE OF VETERANS BUSINESS \n                   DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to the Office of \n     Veterans Business Development of the Small Business \n     Administration, and to remain available until expended--\n       (1) $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (2) $2,100,000 for fiscal year 2007; and\n       (3) $2,200,000 for fiscal year 2008.\n\n     SEC. 4. PERMANENT EXTENSION OF SBA ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON \n                   VETERANS BUSINESS AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Assumption of Duties.--Section 33 of the Small Business \n     Act (15 U.S.C. 657c) is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (h); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsections (i) through (k) as \n     subsections (h) through (j), respectively.\n       (b) Permanent Extension of Authority.--Section 203 of the \n     Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act \n     of 1999 (15 U.S.C. 657b note) is amended by striking \n     subsection (h).\n\n     SEC. 5.

STUDY ON OPTIONS FOR IMPROVING TIMELY NOTICE OF \n                   EMPLOYERS OF MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND \n                   RESERVES REGARDING MOBILIZATION.\n\n       (a) Study Required.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a \n     study of the feasibility and advisability of various options \n     for improving the time in which employers of members of the \n     reserve components of the Armed Forces are notified of the \n     call or order of such members to active duty other than for \n     training.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purpose of the study under paragraph (1) \n     shall be to identify mechanisms, if any, for eliminating or \n     reducing the time between--\n       (A) the date of the call or order of members of the reserve \n     components of the Armed Forces to active duty; and\n       (B) the date on which employers of such members are \n     notified of the call or order of such members to active duty.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress a report on the study \n     conducted under subsection (a). The report shall include--\n       (1) a description of the study, including the options \n     addressed under the study; and\n       (2) such recommendations for legislative or administrative \n     action as the Secretary considers appropriate in light of the \n     results of the study.\n       (c) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' \n     means--\n       (1) the Committees on Armed Services and Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Committees on Armed Services and Small Business of \n     the House of Representatives.\n       Background: From September 2001 through November 2004, \n     approximately 410,000 National Guard and Reserve personnel \n     have been mobilized in support of current operations. Thirty-\n     five percent of Guard and Reserve members work for small \n     businesses or are self-employed, 26 percent work for large \n     businesses, 36 percent work for the government, Federal, \n     State, or local, and the remainder work for non-profits. \n     Therefore, the majority of non-government employed Guard and \n     Reserve members are either self-employed, or work for small \n     businesses. As a result of call-ups, many small businesses \n     have been forced to go without their owners and key personnel \n     for months, and sometimes years, on end. The effects have \n     been devastating to these patriotic small businesses.\n       This Act will help stem the effects of Guard and Reservist \n     call-ups on small businesses and better assist veterans and \n     service-disabled veterans with their business needs.\n       Section 1.--Title, ``The Supporting Our Patriotic \n     Businesses Act.''\n       Section 2.--Findings\n       Section 3.--Authorizes increased appropriations for the \n     Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Veteran \n     Business Development to $2 million for Fiscal Year 2006, $2.1 \n     million for Fiscal Year 2007 and $2.2 million for Fiscal Year \n     2008.\n       Reasoning: The SBA's Office of Veteran Business Development \n     has made a concerted effort to reach out to small businesses \n     affected by military deployments, but given the sheer number \n     of those deployed, their resources have been stretched thin. \n     In addition, the Office of Veterans Business Development is \n     now required to broaden its delivery of services, as directed \n     by Executive Order 13360, to provide procurement training \n     programs for service-disabled veterans. This provision will \n     allow the SBA's Office of Veterans Business Development to \n     better assist our nation's veterans and provide them the \n     business services they need.\n       Section 4.--Permanently extends the authority and duties of \n     the SBA's Advisory Committee on Veterans Business Affairs.\n       Reasoning: The SBA's Advisory Committee on Veterans \n     Business Affairs has served as a valuable independent source \n     of advice and policy on veterans business issues to: the SBA \n     Administrator; the SBA's Associate Administrator for Veterans \n     Business Development; the Congress; the President; and other \n     U.S. policymakers. The Advisory Committee was commissioned \n     under P.L. 106-50 and is set to terminate its duties on \n     September 20, 2006. This provision will help ensure that the \n     Advisory Committee's vital duties, and the information it \n     provides, are continued.\n       Section 5.--Provides that a service member need not satisfy \n     any continuing education requirements, imposed with respect \n     to their profession or occupation, while they are called up, \n     or within the 120-day period after they are released from the \n     call-up.\n       Reasoning: Many Guard and Reserve personnel have continuing \n     education requirements that they are unable to satisfy \n     because of being called to active duty. These patriotic \n     individuals should not have to satisfy these continuing \n     education requirements. NOTE: This provision is a floor, not \n     a ceiling. It should not discourage State or other entities \n     from offering extended benefits/breaks to deployed Guard and \n     Reserve members.\n       Section 6.--Amends the Small Business Act by allowing small \n     businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled veterans to \n     extend their SBA program participation time limitations by \n     the duration of their owners' active duty service after \n     September 11, 2001.\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\n       Reasoning: Some of the SBA's contracting and business \n     development programs have defined time limits for \n     participation. If the firm's time for participation expires \n     prematurely, then competitive opportunities, investments, and \n     jobs become lost. Currently, small business owners who get \n     called up to active duty in the National Guard or Reserve are \n     effectively penalized because their active duty time is \n     counted against the time limitations on participation in the \n     SBA's programs.\n       Section 7.--Requires that the Secretary of each military \n     department ensure that counseling is provided, at least once \n     a year, to members of the National Guard and Reserves on the \n     importance of notifying their employers regarding their \n     mobilization.\n       Reasoning: Employers often receive little warning of a \n     guard or reservist's call-up. A survey published by the DoD \n     in November 2003 (DMDC Report No. 2003-10), which questioned \n     guard and reservists who had been called up over the previous \n     24 months, indicated that they notified their civilian \n     employers an average of 13 days before their call-up began. \n     The survey also showed that almost 60 percent of Guard and \n     Reservists gave their employers advance notice of one week or \n     less. Unfortunately, providing short notice to employers does \n     not allow them time to adequately plan for a guard member or \n     Reservist's absence, and ultimately hurts a business's bottom \n     line. It is important that employers have ample time to make \n     the adjustments necessary to sustain their business.\n       Section 8.--Improves the focus upon notifying employers in \n     a timely manner regarding call-ups.\n       Reasoning: For the reasons provided under Section 7, this \n     provision would commission a DoD study on ways to improve the \n     timely notice of employers regarding call-ups.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeMINT:\n  S. 1015. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \ncooperative governing of individual health insurance coverage offered \nin interstate commerce; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Health Care \nChoice Act of 2005, a bill that would help Americans afford health \ninsurance.\n  Approximately 45 million Americans lack health insurance. These \nuninsured Americans face significant hurdles in entering the insurance \nmarketplace, including limited choices of insurers and inflexible \nbenefit options. For most, the high cost of health insurance is the \nbiggest impediment to getting coverage. In fact, nearly two-thirds of \nthe uninsured are the working poor, and they cite the high cost of \ninsurance as the primary barrier to accessing health coverage.\n  The cost of insurance is often increased by excessive State \nregulations. These State mandates raise the cost of insurance which, in \nturn, increases the number of Americans who are priced out of the \nhealth insurance market.\n  The Health Care Choice Act will allow consumers to shop for health \ninsurance the same way they do for other insurance products--online, by \nmail, over the phone, or in consultation with an insurance agent in \ntheir hometown. The Act empowers consumers by giving them the ability \nto purchase an affordable health insurance policy with a range of \noptions.\n  Consumers will no longer be limited to picking only those policies \nthat meet their state's regulations and mandated benefits. Instead, \nthey can examine the wide array of insurance policies qualified in one \nState and offered for sale in multiple states. Consumers can choose the \npolicy that best suits their needs, and their budget, without regard to \nState boundaries. Individuals looking for basic health insurance \ncoverage can opt for a policy with few benefit mandates, and such a \npolicy will be more affordable. On the other hand, consumers who have \nan interest in a particular benefit, such as infertility treatments, \nwill be able to purchase a policy which includes that benefit.\n  The Health Care Choice Act will help the uninsured find affordable \nhealth insurance, while also providing every American with more and \nbetter health insurance choices. The bill harnesses the power of the \nmarketplace to allow Americans to tailor their insurance choices to \ntheir individual needs.\n  I am grateful to Congressman Shadegg for introducing the Health Care \nChoice Act in the House today, and I urge my Senate colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as ``Health Care Choice Act of \n     2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SPECIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY FOR \n                   ENACTMENT OF LAW.\n\n       This Act is enacted pursuant to the power granted Congress \n     under article I, section 8, clause 3, of the United States \n     Constitution.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The application of numerous and significant variations \n     in State law impacts the ability of insurers to offer, and \n     individuals to obtain, affordable individual health insurance \n     coverage, thereby impeding commerce in individual health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (2) Individual health insurance coverage is increasingly \n     offered through the Internet, other electronic means, and by \n     mail, all of which are inherently part of interstate \n     commerce.\n       (3) In response to these issues, it is appropriate to \n     encourage increased efficiency in the offering of individual \n     health insurance coverage through a collaborative approach by \n     the States in regulating this coverage.\n       (4) The establishment of risk-retention groups has provided \n     a successful model for the sale of insurance across State \n     lines, as the acts establishing those groups allow insurance \n     to be sold in multiple States but regulated by a single \n     State.\n\n     SEC. 4. COOPERATIVE GOVERNING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE \n                   COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title XXVII of the Public Health Service \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 300gg et seq.) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following new part:\n\n``PART D--COOPERATIVE GOVERNING OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE\n\n     ``SEC. 2795.

An issuer, with respect to a particular policy, may \n     only designate one such State as its primary State with \n     respect to all such coverage it offers. Such an issuer may \n     not change the designated primary State with respect to \n     individual health insurance coverage once the policy is \n     issued, except that such a change may be made upon renewal of \n     the policy. With respect to such designated State, the issuer \n     is deemed to be doing business in that State.\n       ``(2) Secondary state.--The term `secondary State' means, \n     with respect to individual health insurance coverage offered \n     by a health insurance issuer, any State that is not the \n     primary State.

A bill to reauthorize grants from the water resources \nresearch and technology institutes established under the Water \nResources Research Act of 1984; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nreauthorizing appropriations for the Water Resources Research Act. The \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, Senators Inhofe and Jeffords, respectively, as well as \nSenators Clinton, Lautenberg, Baucus, Murkowski, Crapo, Enzi and \nCorzine have joined me as original cosponsors of this important \nlegislation to address our nation's water resource concerns.\n  Originally enacted in 1964, the Water Resources Research Act \nauthorizes the establishment of a nationwide, State-based network of \nWater Resources Research Institutes. These Institutes represent a \npartnership among State universities; Federal, State, and local \ngovernments; and stakeholders aimed at solving problems of water supply \nand water quality. They are located at the land-grant universities in \neach of the 50 States, the territories and the District of Columbia.\n  The 54 Water Resources Research Institutes are charged with \nconducting competent research to develop new technologies and more \nefficient methods for resolving local, State and national water-\nresources problems; fostering new research scientists into water \nresources fields; and facilitating water research coordination and the \napplication of research results through information dissemination and \ntechnology transfer.\n  The Institutes provide important support to the States in their long-\nterm water planning, policy development, and management. A significant \nportion of the Institutes' work is intended to help State and local \nwater managers implement Federal regulations in ways that are tailored \nto local and State institutions and natural conditions. Water quality \nregulations, drinking water standards, wastewater treatment, and water \nreuse programs are examples of areas in which the Institutes provide \nresearch and information transfer.\n  In my own State, the Rhode Island Water Resources Center is located \nat the University of Rhode Island. The Center's recent activities have \nincluded working with the Rhode Island Airport Corporation to develop a \nplan for mitigating runoff contamination due to deicing and anti-icing \noperations at T.F.Green Airport. Other work conducted by the Center has \nencompassed evaluating the scour potential of streams and river banks \nin the State to study how they may be affected by land use and other \nchanges; developing a statewide public water-supply GIS coverage \nprogram; and working with communities to evaluate MTBE drinking water \ncontamination.\n  In addition to research, the outreach and information transfer \nactivities of the Institutes are highly valued by multi-level \nstakeholders at the local, State and regional levels. The Institutes \nare the training grounds for the next generation of the Nation's water \nscientists, economists and engineers. This nationwide network of water \ninstitutes provides an efficient and effective method to meet the \ndiverse water resource needs in different parts of our country.\n  Another key component of the program is the importance of its small \nFederal grants for leveraging funding from non-federal sources to \nidentify and address local and State needs for water research. Without \nthis Federal seed money, many institutes would lose a valuable resource \nand the visibility within their universities and among Federal, State \nand local water agencies for working on challenging water resource \nproblems. The Federal grants allow immense leverage capacity for \nconducting water research activities and are the key to maintaining a \nvaluable national network.\n  The legislation I am introducing today reauthorizes $62 million in \nfunding through fiscal year 2010 for the Nation's Water Resources \nResearch Institutes and $32 million for the Act's Interstate Research \nProgram. I look forward to working with the bill's original cosponsors \nas well as my colleagues on the Environment and Public\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\nWorks Committee to ensure this national network of university-based \nresearch institutes continues to support the water resources needs of \nthe Nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1017\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that transit pass transportation fringe \nbenefits be made available to all qualified Federal employees in the \nNational Capital Region; to alllow passenger carriers which are owned \nor leased by the Government to be used to transport Government \nemployees between their place of employment and mass transit \nfacilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Federal \nEmployee Commuter Benefits Act of 2005, which is cosponsored by my \ncolleagues Senators Mikulski and Warner. This bill will guarantee \ntransit benefits to all Federal employees in the National Capital Area \nand will remove a restriction that currently forbids Federal agencies \nfrom providing employee shuttles to and from transit stations. This \nmeasure is an important step forward in our efforts to encourage \ntransit ridership and improve the quality of life for federal employees \nin the Washington, D.C. region and throughout the Nation.\n  All across the Nation, congestion and gridlock are taking their toll \nin terms of economic loss, environmental impact, and personal \nfrustration. According to the Texas Transportation Institute, in 2003 \nAmericans in 85 urban areas spent 3.7 billion hours stuck in traffic, \nwith an estimated cost to the nation of $64.8 billion in lost time and \nwasted fuel. In response, Americans are turning to alternative \ntransportation in record numbers. The American Public Transportation \nAssociation estimates that Americans now take over 9 billion trips on \ntransit per year, the highest level in more than 40 years. The Texas \nTransportation Institute has estimated that without transit, the 85 \nurban areas they studied would have suffered an additional 1.1 billion \nhours of delay, a 27 percent increase, which would have added $18 \nbillion to the national cost of congestion.\n  Transit benefit programs are playing a vital role in increasing \ntransit ridership, which benefits both transit users and drivers. In \n1998, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century amended the \ntax code to allow financial incentives related to commuting costs for \nboth employers and employees. These transit benefits allowed employers \nto offer a tax-free financial incentive toward the costs of transit \ncommuting, starting at $65 per month and raised in 2005 to $105 per \nmonth.\n  Based upon the findings of the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, there are clear improvements to \ncongestion, energy efficiency, and air quality from transit benefit \nprograms. According to their findings, an employer with 1,000 employees \nthat participates in a combination of transit benefits, carpool, and \ntelecommuting programs can take credit for taking 175 cars off the \nroad, saving 44,000 gallons of gasoline per year, and cutting global \nwarming pollution by 420 tons per year on average.\n  In April 2000, an Executive Order was signed requiring all executive \nbranch agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit \nbenefits to their employees. As a result, Federal employees commuting \nto Washington, D.C. from Montgomery, Prince George's, and Frederick \nCounties, Maryland, several counties in Northern Virginia, and as far \naway as West Virginia, are encouraged to choose transit as their means \nto get to work.\n  According to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation, more than 150,000 employees--\nmore than one-third of all Federal employees in the National Capital \nRegion--joined the Federal transit benefit program created by the \nExecutive Order. These program participants alone have eliminated an \nestimated 12,500 single-occupancy vehicles from Washington, D.C. area \nroads, helping to reduce congestion and improve air quality for our \nregion.\n  The Executive Order, however, is limited. It does not cover employees \nin the legislative and judicial branches, for example, or in dozens of \nindependent agencies. While many of the employers in those \norganizations provide transit benefits to their employees, the \nimplementation and level of benefit is up to the discretion of \nindividual offices. As such, many of these organizations provide \nlimited benefits or do not provide any benefits at all. Guaranteed \ntransit benefits would give these employees more choice in their \ncommuting options and provide an additional incentive to move off our \ncongested roadways and onto public transit.\n  Of course, such incentives will be ineffective if employees lack \naccess to transit services. In my own state of Maryland, the United \nStates Food and Drug Administration planned to use its own resources to \nprovide a shuttle service for its employees from its new White Oak \nfacility to an area Metro station. When they investigated providing \nthis service, FDA officials found that the current law does not allow \nfederal agencies to use their own vehicles to shuttle employees to mass \ntransit stations.\n  The potential impact of this restriction on regional congestion is \nnot insignificant. By the middle of this year, FDA expects to have \n1,850 employees located at the new White Oak facility, and plans have \nbeen made to eventually house more than 7,000 FDA researchers and \nadministrators at the new facility. The lack of access from FDA's new \ncampus to a transit station represents a lost opportunity for reducing \ncongestion, improving our environment and elevating the quality of life \nfor employees.\n  This type of lost opportunity occurs across the nation. Nationally, \nthe Federal Government employs more than 2.6 million civilian workers \nat more than 3,000 Federal Government office buildings. At Federal \noffices throughout the country, transit use is often limited as a \ncommuting option due to lack of employee access to a transit station or \na bus stop.\n  The Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act would address both of \nthese issues faced by Federal employees. First, the bill would put into \nlaw the Executive Order's requirement that transit pass benefits be \nmade available to all qualified Federal employees in the National \nCapital Region. The bill also extends the requirement beyond executive \nbranch agencies to include the legislative and judicial branches and \nthe independent agencies, providing guaranteed transit benefits to \nthousands of additional federal employees in the Washington, DC region.\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\n  Second, the Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act would remove the \nrestriction that prohibits a Federal agency from operating a shuttle \nservice to a public transit facility. With this legislation, any \nFederal agency, anywhere in the United States, can choose to provide a \ntransit shuttle service for their employees. By providing access to \ncommuting alternatives, Federal agencies will be able to provide a \nbenefit to their employees that can make getting to work easier, more \naffordable, and more employee-friendly. It will also provide an \nopportunity to help reduce congestion and improve air quality across \nthe Nation.\n  Since 1982, the U.S. population has grown 20 percent, but the time \nspent by commuters in traffic has grown by over 200 percent. Each year, \ntraffic congestion wastes nine billion gallons of fuel. By encouraging \nfederal employees to look to transit and by providing access to transit \nstations, we can help reduce congestion, improve the environment, and \npromote an improved quality of life.\n  I am introducing the Federal Employee Commuter Benefits Act because \nof the opportunities it will give federal agencies to support public \ntransportation, both by providing employee access to transit facilities \nacross the nation, and by providing transit benefits to federal \nemployees in the Washington, D.C. region. Both of these improvements \nwill aid our efforts to fight congestion and pollution by encouraging \nthe use of transportation alternatives. This legislation is strongly \nsupported by federal employees, transit providers, and local elected \nofficials, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, along \nwith letters of support, be printed in the Record. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the Federal Employee Commuter \nBenefits Act.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1018\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Paul Sarbanes\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Subject: H.R. 1283\n\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The American Federation of \n     Government Employees (AFGE) Local 12 represents 3,600 \n     employees at the U.S. Department of Labor in the Washington \n     D.C. metropolitan area.\n       We appreciate very much all the work you have done on \n     behalf of Federal employees, in particular your work to \n     assist our local in our three year battle to have the monthly \n     transit subsidy raised to $100.\n       We respectfully request that you sponsor and introduce in \n     the Senate a companion bill to H.R. 1283. The purpose of H.R. \n     1283 is ``To provide that transit pass transportation fringe \n     benefits be made available to all qualified Federal employees \n     in the National Capital Region; to allow passenger carriers \n     which are owned or leased by the Government to be used to \n     transport Government employees between their place of \n     employment and mass transit facilities, and for other \n     purposes.''\n       H.R. 1283 was introduced by Congressman Jim Moran and is \n     co-sponsored by Representatives Eleanor Holmes Norton, Albert \n     Wynn, Chris Van Hollen, Steny Hoyer, Frank Wolf, and Earl \n     Blurnenauer. It has been referred to the House Government \n     Reform Committee.\n       Passage into law of this legislation would not only help \n     employees at any Federal agency in this area where management \n     has decided, for whatever reason, not to offer the tax-free \n     maximum transit subsidy. It would also benefit the region \n     generally by giving more Federal employees the incentive to \n     use mass transit, thus helping to lessen traffic congestion \n     and air pollution.\n       The membership of AFGE Local 12 passed a resolution on May \n     5 of this year in support of this kind of legislation. A copy \n     of the resolution is attached.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration of this serious \n     matter.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                            Lawrence C. Drake, Jr.\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Approved by the membership of AFGE Local 12 on May 5, 2005\n\n\n               Resolution on transit subsidy legislation\n\n       Whereas: Using mass transit is one of the most cost-\n     effective, environmentally sound, and energy efficient ways \n     for Federal employees to commute to their workplaces;\n       Executive Order 13150 ordered transit subsidies, now valued \n     at a maximum of $105 a\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\n     month, to be made available to all executive branch \n     employees;\n       Pursuant to Executive Order 13150, the number of executive \n     branch employees utilizing transit subsidies grew from 55,000 \n     to 155,000 participants, reducing highway vehicle miles \n     commuted by over 40 million;\n       The Washington DC metropolitan area's traffic congestion is \n     overall the country's third worst and is worse than any other \n     metropolitan area outside California;\n       As the region's largest employer, the Federal government \n     has the capacity and the moral duty to significantly reduce \n     road overcrowding and its consequent pollution by providing \n     appropriate transit benefits to encourage more widespread \n     mass transit use;\n       Legislation codifying transit benefits for Federal \n     employees in the Washington DC metropolitan area and \n     repealing restrictions on Federal agencies offering their \n     employees shuttle services between their offices and transit \n     centers, unanimously approved by the House Government Reform \n     Committee in the previous Congress, has been re-introduced as \n     H.R. 1283 by Rep. Jim Moran and six co-sponsors; and\n       Codifying these benefits would remedy Executive Order \n     13150's lack of legal recourse against agencies willfully \n     ignoring its requirements;\n       Therefore be it resolved that:\n       American Federation of Government Employees Local 12 \n     endorses legislation such as H.R. 1283 which codifies \n     Executive Order 13150 and repeals restrictions on Federal \n     agencies offering their employees shuttle services between \n     their offices and transit centers; and\n       AFGE 12 likewise urges other organizational entities with \n     which it is affiliated in the American Federation of \n     Government Employees and the AFL-CIO to actively seek \n     enactment of such legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Public Transportation\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                                     May 11, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n         Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: On behalf of the more than 1,500 \n     member organizations of the American Public Transportation \n     Association (APTA), I write to express strong support for \n     legislation you are proposing that would expand the use of \n     transit-related commuter tax benefits in the Washington, DC \n     region. This legislation will help promote the use of public \n     transportation and thereby support regional efforts to reduce \n     traffic congestion in the National Capital area. We note that \n     a recent report by the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) \n     cited the Washington, DC metropolitan area as the third most \n     congested in the nation.\n       As we understand it, your legislation would codify language \n     currently in an executive order that requires federal \n     executive branch agencies to offer to their employees transit \n     benefits equal to employee commuting costs, currently up to \n     $105 per month. The legislation would also expand the \n     eligibility of these benefits to legislative and judicial \n     branch employees in the National Capital area.\n       We believe that it is important that the federal government \n     support the use of public transportation in its efforts to \n     reduce congestion, minimize auto pollution, and make the best \n     use of existing public transportation facilities that are \n     built with a substantial federal investment. APTA has been a \n     long-time proponent of providing federal tax incentives that \n     promote public transportation at no less a level than those \n     provided for parking.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this issue. If you have \n     questions, please have your staff contact Rob Healy of APTA's \n     Government Affairs Department at (202) 496-4811 or e-mail \n     rhealy@apta.com. We look forward to working with you to see \n     this important legislation enacted into law.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                William W. Millar,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                        Metro,\n\n                                                   April 15, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     U. S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am pleased to offer the Washington \n     Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's (WMATA) endorsement of \n     the legislation you are proposing concerning federal employee \n     commuter benefits. This legislation is very important in \n     supporting regional efforts to use every feasible technique \n     to reduce the severe traffic congestion in the National \n     Capital Region.\n       The recently released Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) \n     report on congestion cites the metropolitan Washington region \n     as the third most congested in the nation, despite intense \n     transit use by commuters in this area.\n       The TTI report cites a number of strategies that help to \n     reduce congestion and the cost of delay to the residents of \n     the region. For the Washington metropolitan area, the TTI \n     report indicates that transit services currently save the \n     metropolitan area more than $1 billion annually in delay \n     costs and over 52 percent of current delay time. The \n     metropolitan Washington region is fifth in the nation in \n     terms of the hours of delay saved because of the public \n     transportation network. The TTI report demonstrates the \n     positive effects of transit services on reducing traffic \n     congestion in the Washington metropolitan area. With the \n     unrelentless traffic in this region, it is critical that \n     transit ridership continues to grow to relieve road \n     congestion.\n       It's essential that the federal government as the region's \n     largest employer, employing more than 374,000 people in this \n     area, give employees every incentive to take transit. The \n     tremendously successful transit benefits program, known in \n     this area as Metrochek, is currently required to be offered \n     to civilian and military employees of the Executive Branch \n     and voluntarily provided by the U.S. House and Senate and \n     several independent agencies. Since the imposition of \n     Executive Order 13150 on October 1, 2000, the number of \n     federal employees receiving transit benefits has increased \n     166 percent, from 57,000 to 151,800 and 47 percent of \n     Metrorail's peak period riders are federal employees--up from \n     35 percent in the mid 1980s.\n       Your proposal will codify the federal employees transit \n     benefit and expand its eligibility to judicial, legislative \n     and independent agency employees in the National Capital \n     Region. While some of these agencies already participate in \n     the Metrochek program, this legislation ensures that \n     participation will be uniform across all three branches of \n     the federal government.\n       WMATA also supports the proposal to authorize the \n     establishment of federal agency shuttles to and from mass \n     transit facilities. While many federal agencies throughout \n     the region are within walking distance of Metrorail stations, \n     and other transit facilities, some are not. This legislation \n     will make transit accessible to many federal workers for whom \n     transit is not currently a viable alternative because their \n     work site is not convenient to a Metro station.\n       Many thanks for your leadership in proposing this \n     legislation. It is another example in a long list of \n     initiatives you have sponsored to promote public \n     transportation in the National Capital Region and the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard A. White,\n     General Manager and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Paul Sarbanes, \n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and \n         Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: I am writing to you to express the \n     support of the Virginia Railway Express for your efforts to \n     reintroduce legislation that would provide transit pass \n     transportation fringe benefits to all qualified Federal \n     employees in the National Capital region. As someone who has \n     always been an advocate for the promotion of public \n     transportation and the mobility it affords the citizenry, we \n     are fortunate to have you as the Ranking Member of the Senate \n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, which \n     oversees mass transit programs.\n       As you have witnessed, increased federal investment in \n     transit under TEA 21 has led to dramatic growth in public \n     transportation ridership, particularly in the National \n     Capital Region. The Virginia Railway Express is a prime \n     example of that growth, with ridership increasing by 17% each \n     year for the past four years, making us one of the fastest \n     growing commuter railroads in America. Nearly 64% of our \n     ridership is comprised of federal and/or military employees \n     working in the region.\n       Currently, transit benefits are offered to a select core of \n     federal employees under Executive Order 13150. The benefit is \n     limited to the executive branch agencies with no requirement \n     for participation by the legislative and judicial branches. \n     Such legislation would codify transit benefits to all \n     eligible federal employees by broadening the scope of \n     participation to another 100,000 workers, thus providing \n     greater flexibility and mobility for the federal work force \n     in the region.\n       Your legislation is significant not only because it affords \n     greater options to our federal workforce, but also because \n     the use of public transit is the only recourse to help \n     relieve the growing problem of traffic congestion in the \n     region. For instance, today VRE transports enough people to \n     remove more than one lane of traffic off of I-95 and I-66 \n     during peak commuting rush hours in the morning and the \n     evening. Not only does it reduce car emissions; thus \n     improving air quality, but also ensures that the federal and \n     private workforce can get to work in a timely fashion; thus \n     saving millions of dollars for employers. The passage of this \n     legislation would only increase these benefits to our region.\n       In conclusion, let me again thank you for all the support \n     that you have given to public transportation over the years \n     and for authoring this much needed legislation. I hope that \n     with your direct involvement that we will be successful in \n     seeing this measure signed into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Dale Zehner,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1019. A bill to amend titles 10 and 38, United States Code, to \nincrease benefits for members of the Armed Forces who, after September \n11, 2001, serve on active duty outside the United States or its \nterritories or possessions as part of a contingency operation \n(including a humanitarian operation, peacekeeping operation, or similar \noperation) or a\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\ncombat operation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Welcome Home \nG.I. Bill. Similar to the GI Bill for soldiers returning from World War \nII, this Welcome Home G.I Bill establishes a program of benefits \ndesigned to reward returning veterans and ease their transition into \ncivilian life.\n  These benefits would be available to troops who deployed for six \nmonths or more outside the United States for combat, contingency, \npeacekeeping or humanitarian operations after September 11, 2001. The \nbill also covers troops who do not meet the six-month service \nrequirement because they were discharged earlier for medical or \nhardship reasons.\n  This bill provides our returning heroes with improved health care, \neducation and job training assistance, and help with a down-payment on \na home.\n  Returning troops deserve better health care coverage. Currently, upon \nseparating from the military, active duty service members receive six \nmonths of healthcare coverage as a ``transition'' benefit and \nthereafter may enroll for an additional 18 months under the Continued \nHealth Care Benefit Program provided they pay required premiums. \nReservists released from active duty can pay premiums to obtain a year \nof coverage for every three months they were mobilized.\n  Under the Welcome Home G.I. Bill, a returning veteran who is unable \nto secure health care coverage from an employer would be entitled to \nexactly the same medical care they received while in the service. \nVeterans would be entitled to this benefit for up to five years.\n  Our troops also deserve better medical screening before and after \ndeployments. Current law establishes a system of pre-deployment and \npost-deployment medical examinations, including an assessment of mental \nhealth and the drawing of blood samples, to accurately record the \nmedical condition of members before and after their deployment.\n  The Welcome Home G.I. bill improves the quality of pre-deployment and \npost-deployment medical screening by requiring that the pre-deployment \nexam include disease screening and the collection of clinical data such \nas vital signs, immunization history and past physical or mental health \nconditions. It also requires post-deployment medical screening to \ninclude a self-administered survey in which the service member may \nreport information about any relevant exposures during the period of \ndeployment. These provisions will help identify war-related ailments so \nthe information will be available to answer any future questions about \nthe ailment's connection to military service.\n  Returning warriors need access to educational opportunities that can \nenhance their employment prospects in civilian life after they depart \nmilitary service. Currently active duty troops have the option of \nenrolling in the Montgomery G.I. Bill education benefits program, under \nwhich the service member contributes $100 per month for 12 months while \nin service and then later may receive up to $1,004 per month in \neducation benefits for up to 36 months. Currently, mobilized reservists \nreceive some portion of the active duty benefit depending on the length \nof their activation. Under the Welcome Home G.I. Bill, our Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans both active duty and mobilized reserve component \ntroops would receive education or job training benefits worth a maximum \nof $75,000 over 48 months. So this bill basically adds a little more \nthan $500 per month to the current benefit and extends it for an extra \nyear. The benefit could also be used to repay student loans. In \naddition, qualifying troops who previously enrolled in the Montgomery \nG.I. Bill program would have their contribution refunded.\n  Finally, the Welcome Home G.I. Bill helps our returning veterans \nrealize the American dream of owning their own home. For a 5-year \nperiod after completion of their qualifying service, returning veterans \nmay receive a tax-free $5,000 down payment for the first-time purchase \nof a home.\n  Our veterans who have endured the burdens of war, under the most \ntrying conditions, at tremendous personal risk and sacrifice, deserve \nmore than they are currently provided by this Nation upon their return. \nThey deserve the improved health care, education and job training, and \nhome-ownership assistance which this bill provides. I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. COLEMAN (for himself and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1020. A bill to make the United States competitive in a global \neconomy; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp the United States compete in an increasingly global economy in \norder to keep and to grow good paying, high quality jobs here at home. \nI am very pleased to be joined by my very good friend and colleague, \nSenator Mark Pryor, who cares as deeply about these issues as I do.\n  In recent years much has been written about globalization--especially \nthe ``outsourcing'' of American jobs overseas. In fact, my hometown \npaper, the St. Paul Pioneer Press recently ran an editorial \nhighlighting a survey done by the Federal Reserve that shows despite \nall the talk of ``outscouring'' and ``lost jobs'', globalization has \nresulted in more jobs and more money for Minnesota's workers. I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be included in the record along \nwith my statement. However, that same editorial warned that as China, \nIndia and the European Union work to expand their own market \nopportunities by modernizing their infrastructure and improving the \nskills of their workforce, there is no guarantee that the world's best \ncompanies will continue to invest here at home.\n  Yet, at the same time that the Labor Department has projected that \nnew jobs requiring advanced science, engineering and technical training \nwill increase four times faster than the average national job growth \nrate, only 36 percent of 9th-12th graders in Minnesota are taking upper \nlevel math courses, and only 22 percent of are taking upper level \nscience. Moreover, in a high tech economy that values knowledge and \nideas as much as the products they produce the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office (PTO) has reported that the time it takes someone to \nget a patent is exploding. The facts read loud and clear: in order to \nmaintain our place as the leader in tomorrow's economy, America must \nact now to maintain our competitive advantage and remain ahead of the \ncurve.\n  That is why we are introducing the Collaborative Opportunities to \nMobilize and Promote Education, Technology, and Enterprise Act of 2005 \nor the COMPETE ACT of 2005. The COMPETE Act is based on three simple, \nfundamental ideas: 1. The U.S. needs to maintain its competitive \nadvantage in robust technology and innovation; 2. We must continue to \n``upskill'' our workforce to ensure they have the skills necessary to \nremain competitive in a global economy that is more reliant on \ntechnology than ever before; and 3. We must utilize private-public \npartnerships to help improve education in the areas of science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics.\n  America's economic strength is rooted in its ability to innovate, and \nso the COMPETE Act strengthens and expands the R tax credit. \nExpanding the R tax credit will help American companies to stay on \nthe forefront of the technological revolution. This credit helps fuel \njob creation here at home and enables companies to bring more products \nand services to market.\n  The COMPETE Act also reforms and improves the U.S. Patent Trademark \nOffice (PTO). It is no secret that patents and trademarks are the \ncurrency that drives America's high-tech economy. Unfortunately, the \nPTO estimates that it will take an average of 49 months by 2009 for it \nto issue a patent. This is a lifetime when you are innovating, and \ndiscourages new ideas. Furthermore, the current backlog on patent \napplications now totals almost a half million--the highest ever. \nFortunately, the PTO has come up with a solution to this problem. \nHowever, it does not have the money to implement it. The COMPETE Act \nprovides the PTO with the crucial funding necessary to reform the \npatent and trademark process so that U.S. companies remain on the \nforefront of the technological revolution.\n  Today, our employers need more than just raw materials; they need a \nhighly skilled workforce who adds that extra value to their product. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\nwhy the COMPETE Act establishes a tax credit that will help ``upskill'' \nAmerica's workers so that they can compete in an economy increasingly \nmore dependent on information, communication and technology (ICT) \nskills. Indeed, ICT skills are today's newest raw material and are the \ninfrastructure America needs to be a leader in today's global market.\n  To help close the math and science gap, the COMPETE Act creates a \npublic-partnership that will leverage the expertise and resources of \nthe private sector and those in the university community to establish \njoint regional training and research centers. These centers will \nprovide training and technical assistance to teachers so they will be \nbetter equipped to get students interested in math and science at an \nearly age.\n  The COMPETE Act rewards high performing schools in math and science \nand at the same time provides an incentive for businesses to get more \ninvolved in helping high-need schools to improve in the areas of math \nand science. Finally, the COMPETE Act establishes a matching grant \nprogram where federal and private resources will be used to help \ngraduate students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics \nmeet the cost of getting a graduate degree. This grant program will \nalso support outreach and mentoring activities to increase the \nparticipation of underrepresented groups in these fields at every level \nof education.\n  Today is the time to prepare for tomorrow and the COMPETE Act \nrepresents an important step in helping to prepare the U.S. to succeed \nin meeting the challenges of a rapidly changing world. The COMPETE Act \nwill help the U.S. remain ahead of the curve when it comes to competing \nin today's global economy. That is why a number of diverse \norganizations, including the R Credit Coalition, National Council of \nTeachers of Mathematics, National Science Teachers Association, \nComputing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA), American \nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, National Association of \nState Universities & Land-Grant Universities, ASSE Engineering Deans \nCouncil, Council of Graduate Schools, American Society for Training & \nDevelopment, Association of American Universities, and the Intellectual \nProperty Owners Association support one or may of tile provisions of \nthe COMPETE Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Today our economy is both more vulnerable and more successful than it \nhas ever been. To ensure that we are maximizing our chances for \nsuccess, we need to help employees and individuals innovate. We need to \nhave a workforce that has the skills necessary to compete in a \nworldwide economy that is increasingly dependent on technology. We need \nto focus on math and science education to ensure that America continues \nto produce the best engineers and scientists in the world. And above \nall, we need to do those things necessary to make the U.S. the best \nplace to do business in the world. The bottom line is we all want \nAmerica's moms and dads to enjoy good paying jobs here at home so they \ncan do what every mom and dad wants to do and that is give our kids a \nbetter life than we had. That's what the COMPETE Act is all about.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Dec. 19, 2004]\n\n               Minnesota Must Compete in a Global Economy\n\n       The Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis recently published \n     the findings of the annual survey conducted by Minnesota \n     Technology Inc. and the Minnesota Department of Employment \n     and Economic Development. The clear message from Minnesota \n     businesses is that globalization is here to stay and it's not \n     all bad.\n       ``It's the new hard reality,'' said Ron Kirscht, president \n     of Donnelly Custom Manufacturing Co. in Alexandria.\n       Indeed, for all the hand wringing over outsourcing and the \n     fact that Bemidji has to compete with Bangalore, it's clear \n     that an increasingly global economy has been a net gain for \n     Minnesota.\n       ``The results showed that state manufacturers and service \n     providers in industries most likely to be affected by \n     globalization are integrating rapidly into the global \n     community, whether through importing, exporting, off shoring \n     or foreign direct investment,'' the Fed said in fedgazette, \n     its monthly publication.\n       For instance, a dozen years ago, Donnelly did very little \n     importing and no exporting. Today it imports components, \n     materials and tools, and exports its custom-built products \n     around the world.\n       ``We couldn't compete if we didn't,'' Kirscht said.\n       Some executives even admit that globalization has made them \n     more competitive.\n       ``There's always the feeling that the fewer the competitors \n     the better,'' said Steven Cheppard, CEO of Kenyon-based \n     Foldcraft Co. ``But in a sort of convoluted fashion it is \n     possible to make a positive out of this. It forces us to make \n     ourselves better and better.''\n       According to the survey, about 21 percent of respondents \n     were importers and 32 percent exporters in 1998. Today both \n     numbers are around 40 percent.\n       About 20 percent of those surveyed reported increased \n     employment and production during the same period. On wages, \n     about 43 percent of businesses expect them to increase; 38 \n     percent see no changes and 19 percent see a decrease due to \n     increased global competition. Perhaps more important, \n     businesses expect to add more new production jobs between now \n     and 2008 than they did between 1998 and 2003.\n       Not surprisingly, the top three reasons cited for \n     outsourcing and importing were to reduce or control costs, \n     increase revenue and increase overall competitiveness. About \n     43 percent of those surveyed said the cost of employee health \n     care benefits was a key factor in their decision to move jobs \n     offshore or out of state. About one-third said wages and \n     taxes chased them out of Minnesota.\n       Team Industries, a designer and manufacturer of power \n     trains for recreational vehicles, has manufacturing plants in \n     six Minnesota cities, and a market reach that extends around \n     the globe. Jason Roue, general manager at the company's \n     Baxter plant in central Minnesota, noted that in the past few \n     years the company has expanded its network of global \n     sourcing.\n       It now imports lower-cost parts and raw materials from \n     around the world, but at the same time have seen significant \n     export growth as international demand for its products has \n     increased.\n       ``If we plan on staying in business, we're going to have to \n     adapt,'' said Roue. ``By adopting global sourcing and lean \n     manufacturing techniques, and by differentiating ourselves \n     from foreign competitors, mainly in China and Korea, we think \n     we can meet the challenge of global competition.''\n       The Fed notes that regardless of how businesses ``feel'' \n     about globalization, ``they seem to understand that \n     membership is not negotiable, but required. ``\n       We agree. Furthermore, we'd argue that when state and local \n     lawmakers are considering new taxes and regulations, even \n     with a projected budget shortfall of $1.4 billion, they also \n     need to consider how our regimen compares with not just \n     Seattle and Shreveport, but Shanghai and Singapore. For the \n     Fed study makes clear that the world--not just the country--\n     is increasingly the competitive landscape on which Minnesota \n     must compete.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Intellectual Property Owners\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2005.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mark Pryor,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Coleman and Pryor: Intellectual Property \n     Owners Association (IPO) writes to voice its strong support \n     for Title III of the COMPETE Act of 2005. As you know, IPO \n     has long advocated ending diversion of the user fees paid by \n     patent and trademark applicants to the U.S. Patent and \n     Trademark Office (USPTO) and Title III of the COMPETE Act of \n     2005 would accomplish this goal.\n       Intellectual property rights including patents and \n     trademarks are the currency that drives America's high-tech \n     economy. Yet, the USPTO currently faces not only a workload \n     crisis, but also questions about the quality of the patents \n     it grants.\n       IPO's recommended objectives for the USPTO are to: (1) \n     improve patent quality, (2) reduce the time it takes \n     applicants to get a patent, and (3) achieve cost \n     effectiveness in all operations. IPO has supported the \n     USPTO's ``21st Century Strategic Plan'' as a way to achieve \n     these objectives, but until now, the USPTO has been hampered \n     by lack of funding. Last year, Congress passed legislation \n     raising patent application fees by 15 to 25 percent. The fee \n     increase will provide more than $200 million a year in \n     additional revenue to the USPTO through September 2006; \n     however, a long term solution to USPTO's funding problems is \n     still needed.\n       America's innovators remain prepared to pay out of our own \n     pockets to improve the situation at the PTO provided that the \n     money will go to the agency and not be diverted to unrelated \n     programs. This fear is not unfounded, given that Congress \n     diverted more than three-quarters of a billion dollars of \n     fees paid by patent and trademark applicants to unrelated \n     government programs from 1992 until 2004.\n       IPO firmly believes that it is reasonable and just that the \n     USPTO keep 100 percent of its own patent and trademark fees. \n     To allow\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\n     for anything less would be a disservice to inventors and \n     entrepreneurs and a drag on our nation's competitiveness and \n     productivity.\n       We thank you for supporting America's innovators by \n     introducing legislation that would end the practice of fee \n     diversion, and we are committed to working with you to ensure \n     that such legislation is enacted into law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Herbert C.

Norm Coleman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coleman: On behalf of the American Society for \n     Training & Development (ASTD), thank you for introducing the \n     Collaborative Opportunities to Mobilize and Promote \n     Education, Technology, and Enterprise Act of 2005 (COMPETE \n     Act). As the world's largest association dedicated to \n     training, workplace learning, and performance professionals, \n     ASTD is acutely aware that one of the most critical issues \n     facing organizations today is developing the knowledge and \n     capabilities of the workforce. Your bill is a big step in the \n     right direction to ensuring that the U.S. workforce remains \n     competitive in the global economy.\n       Sections 111-112 of Title I, the Tax Credit for Information \n     and Communications Technology Education and Training Program \n     Expenses, are of particular interest to ASTD. This tax credit \n     can benefit all U.S. companies because every industry \n     requires IT skills, not just IT-based companies. According to \n     ASTD's 2004 State of the Industry Report, one of the most \n     important content areas in which employees are trained in \n     U.S. organizations is IT and systems training. A tax credit \n     for expenses paid or incurred for IT training demonstrates a \n     targeted solution for both employer and employee (or an \n     unemployed individual). Employers identify what training is \n     needed; employees are able to train or upskill in industries \n     that need skilled workers. And because employers or \n     individuals are required to pay half the training or \n     educational costs, there is a greater likelihood that the \n     program will be successful. ASTD therefore supports your \n     efforts to include these sections in the COMPETE Act.\n       Many businesses find themselves ill-equipped to grow \n     because the skills required to meet demand for growth are in \n     short supply in their organizations. A full 66 percent of \n     respondents to a recent ASTD poll say there is a skills gap \n     in their organizations right now, and almost 20 percent say \n     there will be one within the next year. The best approach for \n     addressing the skills gap is the COMPETE Act's solution of \n     providing government incentives that enable the private \n     sector to train or educate more people in the industries in \n     which skilled workers are needed.\n       The COMPETE Act is an excellent example of a public-private \n     partnership that can ensure companies remain competitive, and \n     individuals seek the education they need to enter or re-enter \n     the workforce. We look forward to working with you and your \n     staff as this bill progresses through the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Tony Bingham,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Council of Graduate Schools,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Norm Coleman,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mark Pryor,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Coleman and Pryor: I am writing to commend \n     you for supporting our nation's economic competitiveness \n     through the introduction of the Collaborative Opportunities \n     to Mobilize and Promote Education, Technology and Enterprise \n     (COMPETE) Act. The Council of Graduate Schools (CGS) and its \n     460 plus member institutions are very grateful for your \n     leadership in addressing the important issue of American \n     competitiveness.\n       CGS is committed to collaborating with you and others on \n     developing a coordinated national strategy to enhance \n     America's competitiveness. The European Union, China, India \n     and many other countries are making large investments in \n     education, research and development, greatly expanding their \n     ability to compete in the global economy. The United States \n     cannot afford to coast on its past successes and must invest \n     now to maintain our economic preeminence and national \n     security in the years ahead.\n       The policy changes you propose include providing a new \n     matching fund program to promote competitiveness through \n     graduate education, extension and enhancement of the R tax \n     credit, and improvements to the Federal patent and trademark \n     process. These policy proposals along with others designed to \n     support math and science education in elementary and \n     secondary schools establish a solid foundation for a longer-\n     term, comprehensive agenda designed to maintain our nation's \n     leadership in innovation, research and discovery.\n       We are also appreciative of your additional legislative \n     efforts to increase global competition for the best and the \n     brightest. As you know, the U.S. must continue welcoming \n     qualified international students to our country and \n     simultaneously implementing policies to address declining \n     participation of domestic students across key fields in \n     science, technology, engineering, mathematics and critical \n     foreign languages.\n       Thank you for your leadership in addressing American \n     competitiveness and for supporting the vital role played by \n     graduate education as a key part of our national strategy to \n     maintain our leadership in the global economy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Debra W.

A bill to reauthorize the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President I rise today to introduce the Workforce \nInvestment Act Amendments of 2005. I am pleased to be joined in this \nimportant effort by Senator Kennedy, the Ranking Member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n  The Workforce Investment Act (WIA), together with the Perkins Career \nand Technical Education Act, which we passed earlier this year, and the \nHigher Education Act, which we will consider in the next few months, \nwill provide the important resources that are needed to adequately \nprepare our workforce with the skills that are necessary for jobs and \ncareers in high wage and high skilled occupations.\n  We are facing an economic challenge that threatens our ability as a \nnation to compete in the global economy. As we heard from the witnesses \nwho testified at a hearing held on April 14, 2005, before the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, we have too few workers with \ntoo few skills. The skill and literacy requirements of today's and \ntomorrow's workplace cannot be met if we do not provide everyone access \nto lifelong education, training and retraining.\n  Sixty percent of tomorrow's jobs will require skills that only 20 \npercent of today's workers possess. About half of our current workforce \ndoes not have a postsecondary education degree or credential, when all \nprojections are that job growth over the next decade will be in jobs \nthat require some postsecondary education or training.\n  Technology is demanding that everyone continue to learn and gain \nskills. In January of this year the labor force participation rate for \nindividuals over the age of 16 who are willing and able to work was \n68.8 percent, the lowest in over 15 years, as more Americans conclude \nthat they cannot meet the skill demands of today's workplace and choose \nto no longer participate in the workforce.\n  The legislation I am introducing today helps meet these challenges. \nIt is the result of a bipartisan process that began in the 108th \nCongress. It gives States and local areas the flexibility to provide \ntraining for jobs in high skill, high wage, and high demand \noccupations. It strengthens connections with the private sector, \npostsecondary education and training, and economic development systems \nto prepare the 21st century workforce. It improves the existing \nstructure of one-stops to ensure an effective response to the changing \nneeds of employers and workers in a new economy. It includes a new \nfocus on entrepreneurial skills and micro-enterprises, addresses unique \nneeds of small businesses and rural areas, and encourages collaboration \nlocally and regionally with economic development and education.\n  This legislation also amends the Adult Education and Family Literacy \nAct and the Vocational Rehabilitation Act. These amendments encourage \ncoordination with K-12 schools, postsecondary education and the \nworkforce system so that individuals with barriers to workforce \nparticipation will have an opportunity to gain the literacy, language \nor core skills they will need to enter and advance in the workplace.\n  I hope that our bipartisan efforts will continue to produce the \nresults that are needed as we move this bill through the Senate and \ninto Conference. This legislation is critical to meeting the workforce \nchallenges of the 21st century. It sends a clear message that we are \nserious about helping our workers and employers remain competitive and \nclosing the skills gap that places America's long-term competitiveness \nin jeopardy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1021\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Workforce Investment Act \n     Amendments of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, It is a privilege to join my colleagues \nin introducing this bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Workforce \nInvestment Act and increase the opportunities for workers to obtain the \nservices and training they need to hold good jobs in the years ahead.\n  This bill strengthens the current One-Stop system we established in \n1998, so that many more people can be served. The bill creates stronger \npartnerships with businesses to recruit new workers, collaborate in \ntraining current workers, improve career ladder opportunities, and work \nwith local leaders to meet the changing needs of their community.\n  The One-Stop system is needed more than ever now, to serve hard-\nworking Americans who have lost their jobs\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\nthrough no fault of their own as we struggle to rebuild our economy and \nadjust to the new century and the globalization forces that are \ntransforming our society and our workforce. Current employees, \nespecially the growing number of manufacturing workers, need effective \ntraining to be eligible for the available jobs in their area.\n  We have also worked to remove the sequencing of services for persons \nentering the workforce who face barriers to employment. Providers can \nmove adults directly to skills training, or create training programs \nthat include literacy and language skills as well, so that job training \nis not delayed.\n  The bill also encourages local providers to continue the training \nprograms until employees can be self-sufficient. For those who start on \nthe minimum wage, the support system should be there to help them \nqualify for the better-paying jobs that will enable them to support \ntheir families. Some men and women may obtain their first job through \nthe system, and continue to participate as they move up their career \nladders.\n  The bill will also help young people. Last summer, the youth \nunemployment rate rose to 17 percent and we were all acutely aware of \nthe special challenges that young workers face in this economy. The \nyouth program will continue to work with both in-school and out-of-\nschool young men and women to help them obtain the education and the \nreal job experience they need to be competitive.\n  The bill pays particular attention to the needs of people with \ndisabilities. Their access to the program is essential if the system is \nto be truly universal. It's unacceptable today that hundreds of \nthousands of people with disabilities are unable to find employment. \nWorkforce training programs must coordinate with vocational \nrehabilitation programs to provide many more opportunities for those \nwith physical and mental challenges.\n  For over thirty years, since the Vocational Rehabilitation Act was \nfirst enacted in 1973, state vocational rehabilitation programs have \nbrought new hope to individuals with disabilities throughout the \ncountry, so that they can reach their full potential and actively \nparticipate in their communities.\n  Through vocational rehabilitation, individuals with disabilities can \nobtain the training, counseling, support and job opportunities they \nneed in order to have independent, productive, and fulfilling lives. \nFor millions of these Americans, vocational rehabilitation is the \ndifference between dependence and independence, between lost potential \nand a productive career.\n  In 1998, vocational rehabilitation became part of the state-wide \nworkforce system in each state. This reauthorization will strengthen \nthat partnership, so that many more working-age individuals with \ndisabilities, even those with the most significant challenges, have \nrealistic opportunities to obtain the services and support they need to \nreach their employment goals.\n  The legislation also strengthens other aspects of independent living, \nso that students and adults with disabilities can receive the services \nand support they need for community-based living.\n  Our goal in this reauthorization is to see that the talents and \nstrengths of all individuals with disabilities are recognized, \nenhanced, and fairly rewarded in communities and workplaces across the \nnation.\n  The bill also contains the Adult Literacy Act, which funds critical \nprograms for states to assist adults in obtaining the basic reading, \nwriting, numeracy and English language skills that they need to be full \nparticipants in the workplace and in society.\n  We all know that education is the great equalizer. Improving basic \nliteracy is a key component of job training. Large numbers of persons \nare on waiting lists across the country to be served under this \nprogram--25,000 people in Massachusetts alone--and we need to do more \nto serve adults who recognize their need to improve these skills in \norder to improve their lives.\n  I commend my colleagues and the many organizations representing \ngovernors, mayors, county officials, youth, women, and low-income \npersons who were so actively involved in preparing this legislation. We \nhave tried to listen carefully to the many leaders who have practical \nexperience in implementing these laws.\n  I look forward to continuing this bipartisan effort and to the early \nenactment of this needed legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 1022. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nfor an energy efficient appliance credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, water and energy are precious resources \nthat we must manage as efficiently as possible. That is why I am \njoining with my colleagues Senator Lincoln and Finance Chairman \nGrassley to introduce the ``Resource Efficient Appliance Incentives Act \nof 2005.'' This bill would provide for manufacturers' tax credits of \nvarying levels for certain energy and water efficient home appliances.\n  Under this bill, for the first time, water efficiency is included in \nthe eligibility criteria for the tax credits for clothes washers. This \nbill provides graduated credits to appliance manufacturers. The more \nefficient the dishwasher, clothes washer or refrigerator, the higher \nthe credit.\n  To spur increased production, the bill provides that these tax \ncredits would apply only to production that exceeds historical \nproduction levels, and requires a three-year rolling average to \ncalculated this production baseline. The bill only applies to \nappliances manufactured in the United States. This will encourage \ninnovation and investment in domestic manufacturing facilities, which \nemploy about 95,000 Americans.\n  Energy savings from this bill would be significant. Super-energy \nefficient and water conserving clothes washers would have to use at \nleast 65 percent less energy than the 2004 federal standard to qualify \nfor the higher credit. Refrigerators must exceed the 2001 energy \nconservation standards for comparably sized models by at least 15 \npercent to receive a credit under this bill.\n  This bill will not only save energy, and reduce the consumers' energy \nbills over the life of the appliance. It is estimated that, over twenty \nyears, the credit would reduce the amount of water used to wash clothes \nby approximately a trillion gallons, the amount used in two years by a \ncity the size of Phoenix, Arizona.\n  In several parts of the country, development is constrained by the \nlack of good quality water and water infrastructure. Having dealt with \nthe water crisis in the Klamath Basin in 2001, when 1,200 farmers and \nranchers had their irrigation water cut off, I can tell you firsthand \nthat the conflicts between competing human and environmental needs are \nreal and are growing.\n  As Benjamin Franklin observed, ``When the well is dry, we know the \nworth of water.'' In many parts of the arid west, the well is running \ndry on a regular basis. The 10-year drought in the Colorado River \nBasin, which has seen relief this year, had produced the lowest flows \non record last year, straining an important resource for millions of \npeople. The Columbia River Basin has also experienced below average \nflows in recent years.\n  The daily per capita water use around the world varies significantly. \nThe U.N. Population Fund cites that, in the United States, we use an \nestimated 152 gallons per day per person, while in the United Kingdom \nthey use 88 gallons. Africans use 12 gallons a day.\n  According to the Rocky Mountain Institute, 47 percent of all water \nsupplied to communities in the United States by public and private \nutilities is for residential water use. Of that, clothes washers \naccount for approximately 22 percent of residential use, while \ndishwashers account for about 3 percent.\n  I firmly believe that we can use technology to improve our \nenvironmental stewardship. Water efficiency can extend our finite water \nsupplies, and also reduce the amount of wastewater that communities \nmust treat.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nbill to provide incentives for water and energy efficient residential \nappliances. I ask unanimous consent that the text of legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\n                                S. 1022\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that offshore energy development on the \nouter Continental Shelf continues to serve the needs of the United \nStates, to create opportunities for new development and the use of \nalternative resources, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation, \nThe Stewardship for our Coasts and Opportunities for Reliable Energy \nAct--SCORE Act--which will ensure that offshore energy development on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf--OCS--continues to serve our nation's \nneeds, create opportunities for new development on the OCS as well as \nthe use of alternative resources such as renewable energy.\n  Since the energy frontier of the OCS was officially opened to \nsignificant oil and gas exploration in 1953, no single region has \ncontributed nearly as much to our Nation's energy production. Today, \nthe OCS represents more than\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\n25 percent of our Nation's natural gas production and more than 30 \npercent of our domestic oil production and it is estimated that 60 \npercent of the oil and natural gas still to be discovered in U.S. will \ncome from the OCS.\n  An average of more than $5 billion in revenues from oil and gas \nproduction are returned to the federal treasury each year from the \nOCS--$145 billion since production began. That is the second biggest \ncontributor of revenue to the Federal Treasury after income taxes.\n  But just as the Western frontier once represented a great unknown to \nour Nation's policymakers, the impact and reality of the OCS seems lost \nin a time warp. While much of the OCS has been off limits for decades, \ntechnological advancements have developed in that time to better target \nthe resources and dramatically reduce the environmental footprint. \nThese innovations will continue to allow crucial exploration and \nproduction to take place but in an environmentally responsible way. For \nexample, we have produced three times as many resources on the OCS as \nwe thought existed 30 years ago.\n  In fact, the Minerals Management Service--MMS--estimates that from \n1985 to 2001, OCS offshore facilities and pipelines accounted for only \n2 percent of the oil released into U.S. waters. In fact, 97 percent of \nOCS spills are one barrel or less in volume. Serving America's energy \nneeds and being good stewards of the environment need not be mutually \nexclusive goals.\n  However, despite our technological prowess and responsible \nexploration, we have yet to fully realize the potential the OCS has to \noffer. Today only 2.5 percent of the 1.76 billion acres that make up \nthe OCS are leased. Most of the Pacific Coast and the eastern Gulf of \nMexico are off limits as is the entire Atlantic seaboard.\n  Almost all of the area on the OCS that is currently leased is in the \nCentral and Western Gulf of Mexico, off the coasts of Louisiana and \nTexas, where 98 percent of total OCS production occurs. However, we \ncannot continue to take without giving something back in return. A \nsignificant portion of OCS revenues must be returned to the coastal \nproducing states off whose coasts they are generated.\n  The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 shares automatically with states 50 \npercent of revenues from mineral production on Federal lands within \nthat State's boundaries. These funds are distributed to States \nautomatically, outside the budget process and not subject to \nappropriations. In fiscal year 2004, the State of Wyoming received $564 \nmillion as a result of this law and the State of New Mexico received \n$365 million. However, there is no similar provision in law for coastal \nproducing states to share federal oil and gas revenues generated on the \nOCS.\n  For both onshore and offshore production, the justification for \nsharing with the state is the same: the state serves as the platform \nwhich enables the Federal Government to support a basic element of our \ndaily lives--turning on our lights, heating our homes and running our \ncommuter trains. In light of the OCS' vital contribution to our \nNation's energy needs, economy and national security, it seems only \nfair and logical that we should return a portion of these revenues to \nthe few states that are providing this crucial supply of energy.\n  The SCORE Act would automatically distribute a significant portion of \nOCS revenues to the five coastal producing States without moratoria off \ntheir coasts Alaska, Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama based on \neach state's production, with 35 percent of each State's allocation \ndirected to coastal counties and parishes.\n  When Hurricane Ivan struck back in September of last year, it should \nhave been a wake up call to us all. Although the storm did not hit \nLouisiana directly, its impact on the price and supply of oil and gas \nin this country could still be felt four months later. One can only \nimagine what the impact would have been had Ivan cut a more Western \npath in the Gulf. How many more hurricane seasons are we going to spend \nplaying Russian roulette with our oil and gas supply?\n  Returning a portion of OCS revenues to coastal producing states is \ncrucial to restoring and preserving the vital wetlands and the billions \nin energy investments they protect. It will also help further \nstrengthen our national economic security by maintaining our current \nenergy supply and continuing to provide the platform for us to go \nfurther in our quest to develop domestic resources while attempting to \nreduce our reliance on foreign energy supplies.\n  In addition to ensuring that the vital offshore energy development \nthat has served our Nation's needs for 50 years can continue, the SCORE \nAct also seeks to establish opportunities for new development on the \nOCS.\n  The legislation would direct the Secretary of Interior to establish \nseaward lateral boundaries for all coastal States by regulation. \nCoastal States with a moratoria currently in place off their coasts \nwould have the option, through their Governor with the consent of the \nState legislature, to explore the possibility of offshore energy \ndevelopment off their coasts.\n  These coastal States could petition the Secretary of Interior for a \nresource assessment of energy sources located within their seaward \nlateral boundaries. With these assessments in hand, the State \nlegislature of the State could request that any or all of the area \nwithin their boundaries, but only beyond 20 miles from their coastline, \nbe made available for leasing. If the Secretary permits leasing within \nthe requesting State's boundary, the State qualifies to receive a \nportion of revenues generated from any production that takes place \nwithin their seaward lateral boundary.\n  Finally, SCORE would provide the opportunity for innovative, \nalternative uses of the OCS, including renewable energy projects such \nas wind, wave and solar. A portion of revenues from this production \nwould be shared with the State off whose coastline the production took \nplace.\n  Next week the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, under \nthe leadership of Chairman Domenici and Senator Bingaman, will begin \nmarking up comprehensive energy legislation. I am hopeful that some \naspects of the proposal I have laid out today will be included as part \nof the bill reported out of committee. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on the Committee over the next few weeks to further \ndiscuss these concepts and make them a reality.\n  Quite simply, SCORE allows our country to continue to utilize the \ntremendous and vital natural resources of the OCS while also providing \nus the opportunity to further explore the unlimited potential of this \nvast frontier. It is time to base our decisions on modern successes \nrather than out-dated worries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 1028. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to enhance the \nprotection of members of the Armed Forces and their spouses from \nunscrupulous financial services sales practices through increased \nconsumer education, and for other purposes, to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Military \nPersonnel Financial Services Education Act of 2005. Senator Collins, my \ncolleague on the Armed Services Committee, has agreed to cosponsor this \nlegislation. This bill will directly address a problem that has plagued \nmilitary servicemen and women for years: a lack of general knowledge \nabout the insurance and other financial services available to them. \nThis deficiency in information has led to many of our brave men and \nwomen in uniform being taken advantage of by unscrupulous companies \nthat have targeted and preyed on junior members of our military.\n  Last year, a series of articles in the New York Times uncovered a \nserious problem: there were a number of companies using misleading \nsales practices to sell expensive life insurance policies to Iraq-bound \nrecruits and other uniformed personnel. These articles led to \ninvestigations by the Department of Justice, reports by the GAO, and \nlegislation by Congress. Earlier this year, I joined with Senator Enzi \nto introduce the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act. \nThat legislation goes a long way toward tracking unscrupulous \ncompanies, and eliminating investment schemes which take advantage of \nour men and women in uniform.\n  But we also need to address our more fundamental responsibilities to \nour\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nservicemen and women, and their families, to ensure that we provide \nthem with adequate financial education so that they can make informed \ndecisions about their future.\n  This bill will require the Department of Defense to provide consumer \neducation for members of the armed forces and their spouses. It \ninstructs the Secretary of Defense to carry out a comprehensive \neducation program for military members regarding public and private \nfinancial services, including life insurance and the marketing \npractices of these services, available to them. This education will be \ninstitutionalized in the initial and recurring training for members of \nthe military.\n  This bill also requires that counseling services on these issues be \nmade available, upon request, to members and their spouses. I think it \nis very important to include the spouses in this program, because we \nall know that investment decisions should be made as a family. Too many \ntimes, a military spouse has to make these decisions alone, while their \nhusband or wife is deployed. This bill will require a permanent, \ntrained counselor at military bases with at least 750 assigned \npersonnel, and a part-time, equally capable counselor available at \nsmaller bases with less than 750. By our calculations, this means about \n230 installations will have full-time counselors.\n  Finally, regarding life insurance, this bill will take existing \nlegislation and DoD policy one more step in the military member's \nfavor. During counseling of members or spouses regarding life \ninsurance, counselors must include information on the availability of \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance--SGLI--as well as other available \nproducts. It requires that any enlisted member in the grades of E1-E4 \nmust provide confirmation that they have received counseling from their \napproved counselor or commander before entering into any new contract \nwith a private sector life insurer. Our legislation will keep the \ncurrent rule of a 7 day waiting period for allotments to take effect to \nfacilitate time for counseling. Existing policies will not be impacted \nby our legislation.\n  I am pleased to be working on this issue with Senator Collins, my \ncolleague on the Armed Services Committee, who has taken such a strong \ninterest in ensuring proper financial education for our servicemembers.\n  In closing, I want to reiterate the importance of this bill to \nmilitary families. If implemented, this legislation will ensure our \nmilitary families are fully equipped to make informed decisions that \nwill best meet their financial and insurance needs. In my view, this is \na provision long overdue. Thank you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Clinton \non legislation that will address the persistent problems that we have \nexperienced with the sale of inappropriate life insurance and \ninvestment products to our servicemen and women. Although these issues \nwere newly publicized last year in a series of articles in the New York \nTimes, these problems actually go back for decades according to a 2002 \nDefense Department report.\n  According to that report, deceptive practices have been employed to \nsell unnecessary and inappropriate financial products to our military \nfor more than thirty years. Furthermore, these sales have been in \nviolation of DoD's policies aimed at regulating the sale of commercial \nproducts on military bases.\n  One of the report's most alarming findings is that these practices \nhave a ``clear and present'' effect on morale, discipline and unit \nintegrity. It states:\n\n       Service members who have been coerced or deceived into \n     buying insurance on a military installation blame not only \n     the sales agents. The victims blame their military superiors \n     for placing them in a position to be misled. The trust and \n     respect that military leaders seek to instill in their \n     subordinates are clearly reduced among those who have bought \n     insurance that is of little or no value to them. This \n     adversely affects the unit integrity.\n\n  The author of this study, an Army General and lawyer, spoke to \nnumerous victims of these deceptive sales practices. He stated in his \nreport that these soldiers told him that they had less trust in their \nmilitary superiors after these incidents. They also expressed a reduced \ninterest in reenlisting.\n  With so many of our troops in harm's way, it is time for Congress to \ntake decisive action on this matter. Although DoD has issued another \nset of draft regulations, it is barred by statute from implementing \nthese reforms until this fall. Moreover, I am not convinced that merely \ntightening the regulation of such sales on base will have the desired \noutcome of significantly reducing the sale of inappropriate insurance \nproducts.\n  The Clinton-Collins legislation would: establish a requirement that \nDoD provide real financial education for service members and their \nspouses; provide for financial counselors at military bases; and \nrequire that junior enlisted personnel receive information on their \nfederally provided life insurance before allotting part of their pay \ntoward the purchase of private life insurance products.\n  These provisions reflect the problems and deficiencies identified by \nDoD's own report. Specifically, the report concluded that DoD's current \npersonal financial education programs were inadequate, noting \nparticularly that the education provided enlisted personnel was \n``substantially less than that provided to junior officers.'' It is our \nbelief that providing military personnel with a sound financial \neducation and access to information is the best method of providing \nthem and their families with the protection that they deserve.\n  While that report went much further in its recommendations, even \nrecommending that such sales be barred, our legislation provides for \nmore moderate measures in the hope that we can make real progress on \nthis matter without resorting to extreme measures that would unfairly \npunish the countless ethical insurance agents who responsibly serve the \nmilitary life insurance market. Instead, our legislation would give our \ntroops the tools to protect themselves against those who engage in \nthese abusive and deceptive sales practices.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 1029. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to expand \ncollege access and increase college persistence, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 1030. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to simplify \nand improve the process of applying for student assistance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce two bills to expand access \nto college. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators \nCollins, Kennedy, and Murray.\n  We are slated to reauthorize the Higher Education Act this Congress, \nafter being unable to do so in the 108th Congress. Over the course of \nthis time, the discussions on higher education have not focused on \nproposals that would help the neediest students attend college. This is \ntroubling, particularly as more and more students are being priced out \nof college, which shortchanges their future and that of our Nation.\n  An individual's climb up the economic ladder is directly related to \nthe amount of education he or she receives. Given the strong \ncorrelation among educational attainment, employment, and wages, the \ncost of not going to college is just too high.\n  And yet, too many college students are underprepared, underfinanced, \nand overworked. Those who make it through are saddled by huge loans. \nBut as reports such as Empty Promises by the Advisory Committee on \nStudent Financial Assistance have shown, many more cannot afford the \ncost of college at all.\n  Even though there have been gains due to the Higher Education Act, \nthe current approach to student aid is not working to close the gap in \ncollege attendance between our lowest and highest income students or \nthe gap between the aid low-income students receive and the actual cost \nof attendance. Indeed, about seven times as many students from high-\nincome families graduate from college by age 24 as students from low-\nincome families. Low-income, college-qualified high school graduates \nhave an annual ``unmet need'' of $4,000 and rising in college expenses.\n  A decline in real dollars spent on grants and sharp increases in the \ncost of college have been key causal factors of this unfortunate \nsituation. Indeed, there has been a steep decline in the purchasing \npower of the Pell Grant, which was established by my predecessor, \nSenator Claiborne Pell, to ensure higher education was not an \n``unachievable dream.'' According to the State PIRGs' Higher Education \nProject, the maximum Pell Grant covered 84 percent of average four-year \npublic tuition costs in 1976. Today, the maximum Pell Grant of $4,050 \ncovers only about 39 percent.\n  Over the last 10 years, tuition and fees at public and private 4-year \ncolleges rose 51 percent and 36 percent, respectively, (after adjusting \nfor inflation), which is a more rapid growth rate than consumer prices. \nStudents have felt the bite as states have drastically cut funding for \npublic colleges.\n  In 2008, the largest number of students in our history will graduate \nfrom high school. Another demographic reality is that our nation will \nneed to ensure a steady stream of replacement workers as college-\neducated baby boomers begin to retire in increasing numbers.\n  This crisis calls out for action. An educated citizenry and a world \nclass workforce should be a national imperative. Our nation cannot \nafford to lose out on the countless returns from a robust education \ninvestment.\n  Today we introduce two bills to expand college access.\n  The first bill, the ACCESS--Accessing College through Comprehensive \nEarly Outreach and State Partnerships--Act, focuses on a program I have \nlong worked with Senator Collins and the other cosponsors to save, \nreinvigorate, and fund the Leveraging Educational Assistance \nPartnership or LEAP program. LEAP is the only program in which the \nfederal and state governments are partners in extending higher \neducation opportunities to financially needy students.\n  The ACCESS Act forges a new Federal incentive for States to do even \nmore to help low-income students by creating within LEAP an access and \npersistence partnership program. States will be rewarded--via higher\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\nlevels of federal matching dollars--for creating vibrant partnerships \nwith colleges, early intervention and mentoring programs, foundations, \nand businesses and providing cohesion and coordination among these \nentities. Access and persistence partnerships have three main goals: to \nprovide low-income students with a grant that fills the gap of their \nunmet need; to increase participation of low-income students in early \ninformation, intervention, mentoring, and outreach programs; and to \nprovide early notification to low-income students of their eligibility \nfor financial aid. Research has shown that successful college access \nprograms are those that offer early intervention and mentoring services \ncoupled with early information about estimated financial aid awards and \nadequate grant funding to make the dream of higher education a reality. \nStudents participating in such programs are more financially and \nacademically prepared, and thus more likely to enroll in college and \npersist to degree completion.\n  The second bill we introduce today, the FAFSA--Financial Aid Form \nSimplification and Access Act--has several key components designed to \nmake the college application process both simple and certain. As the \nadvisory committee's recent report, The Student Aid Gauntlet, has \nshown, students today confront an overly burdensome and complex \nfinancial aid application process. Our legislation would simplify this \nprocess by allowing more students to qualify for an Automatic-Zero--\nauto-zero--Expected Family Contribution by aligning its eligibility \nwith the standards of other federal means-tested programs, like free \nschool lunch, SSI, and Food Stamps. Students and families should not \nhave to prove over and over again that they are low-income, and asking \nstudents to fill out lengthy forms when they already meet the \neligibility level for Pell Grants is a burden we should ease.\n  In a similar vein, the legislation establishes a short, paper EZ-\nFAFSA application form for students qualifying for the auto-zero; \nphases out the printing of the long paper form and utilizes the savings \nto bridge the digital divide for students without web access; requires \nthe utilization of smart technology to create a tailored web-based \napplication form that ensures students answer only the questions needed \nto determine financial aid eligibility in the State in which they \nreside; and creates a free telefile system for students without \nInternet access. Additionally, the FAFSA Act requires the Secretary, in \ncooperation with states and colleges, to develop a system for students \nto get early estimates of aid from multiple sources, learn if they \nqualify to fill out an EZ FAFSA, and notify those participating in \nFederal means-tested programs of their potential eligibility for a \nmaximum Pell Grant. Simplified forms and an early information system \nproviding details on what filling out these forms means to students is \ncritical, particularly given the American Council on Education's \nfindings that one of every five dependent low-income students and one \nof every four independent low-income students failed to take advantage \nof financial aid programs because they did not submit a FAFSA.\n  The FAFSA Act also expands college access for low-income students, in \npart by simplifying the application process for students with special \ncircumstances, including students in foster care and emancipated youth; \nensuring the equitable treatment of prepaid tuition and college savings \nplans; and reducing the work penalty. The current income protection \nallowance levels are unrealistically low, creating a disincentive for \nstudents to work in order to pay college costs.\n  We must act on these bills and others to make sure that every student \nwho works hard and plays by the rules gets the opportunity to live the \nAmerican Dream.\n  I was pleased to work with the Advisory Committee on Student \nFinancial Assistance and a host of other higher education organizations \nand charitable foundations on these bills.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor these bills and work for their \ninclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of these bills \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to enhance the reliability of the electric system; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Electric \nReliability Act of 2005, which I am pleased to introduce with my \ncolleagues, Senator Clinton and Senator Jeffords. This legislation \nwould give the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--FERC--authority to \ndevise a system of mandatory and enforceable standards for the reliable \noperation of our Nation's electricity grid.\n  Enactment of this bill is long overdue. The provisions of this bill \nhave passed the United States Senate many times. They represent crucial \nsteps forward in the effort to modernize our Nation's electricity grid \nand reform the rules by which it is operated. I believe this body can \nand must make necessary progress in upgrading our electricity grid.\n  As surely my colleagues recall, in August of 2003 much of the \nNortheast and Midwest suffered a massive power outage, affecting 50 \nmillion consumers from New York to Michigan. This blackout, the biggest \nin our Nation's history, has underscored the need for mandatory and \nenforceable reliability standards--as envisioned in the Electric \nReliability Act of 2005. To date, the system has operated under a set \nof voluntary guidelines, with no concrete penalties for those that \nbreak the rules and jeopardize the reliable energy service that is the \nfoundation of our Nation's economy.\n  Following the August 2003 blackout in the NE, a joint report issued \nby the United States and Canada the following April recommended a \nnumber of policy changes on both sides of our shared border. The first \nrecommendation in that report was to make reliability standards \nmandatory and enforceable with penalties for non-compliance. The \nElectric Reliability Security Act of 2005 does exactly that.\n  While the August 2003 blackout was certainly a potent reminder, the \ncall for reliability legislation dates back at least another 5 years. \nIn 1997, both a Task Force established by the Clinton administration's \nDepartment of Energy and a blue ribbon panel formed by the North \nAmerican Electric Reliability Council--NERC--determined that \nreliability rules for our Nation's electric system had to be made \nmandatory and enforceable.\n  These conclusions resulted, in part, from an August 1996 blackout in \nthe Western Interconnection, where the short-circuit of two overloaded \ntransmission lines near Portland, OR, caused a sweeping outage that \nknocked out power for up to 16 hours in 10 States, including my home \nState of Washington. The blackout affected 7.5 million consumers from \nIdaho to California, resulting in the automatic shut-down of 15 large \nthermal nuclear generating plants in California and the Southwest--\ncompromising the West's energy supply for several days, even after \npower had mostly been restored to end-users.\n  As outlined in Economic Impacts of Infrastructure Failures, a 1997 \nreport submitted to the President's Commission on Critical \nInfrastructure Protection, the blackout was estimated to exact between \n$1 billion and $4 billion in direct and indirect costs to utilities, \nindustry and consumers. The report also detailed the risks the outage \nposed to public health and safety, including an exponential increase in \ntraffic accidents, hospitals forced to rely on emergency back-up power \ngeneration, and the grounding of more than 2,000 airline passengers.\n  While it took time to develop consensus, the Senate recognized the \nhuman and economic stakes associated with the reliable operation of the \nelectricity grid. Stand-alone legislation very similar to what I have \nintroduced today passed this body in June 2000, when this Chamber was \nunder Republican control. And even as the majority has twice changed \nhands since then, the United States Senate has twice passed the very \nprovisions included in the Electric Reliability Act of 2005 as part of \ncomprehensive energy legislation.\n  Today I am introducing the Electric Reliability Act of 2005 as I \nbelieve it is time for this body to take concrete steps towards \nensuring the continued reliable operation of our electric grid. This \nlegislation would mark a substantial achievement in the effort to \nupgrade the reliability of our Nation's grid and insulate our economy \nfrom the disastrous impacts of electricity outages.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1032. A bill to improve seaport security; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at the end of 2002, the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act became law.\n  I was a member of the conference committee on that bill, and I think \nit was a good first step in improving security at our Nation's ports.\n  It had many good provisions, such as the creation of national and \nregional maritime transportation/port security plans to be approved by \nthe Coast Guard; better coordination of Federal State, local, and \nprivate enforcement agencies; and the establishment of a grant program \nfor port authorities, waterfront facilities operators, and State and \nlocal agencies to provide security infrastructure improvements.\n  The problem with the bill was that it had no guaranteed funding \nmechanism. As a result, we are underfunding port security. Since the \npassage of the Maritime Transportation Security Act, the Department of \nHomeland Security has awarded approximately $625 million in port \nsecurity grants. This is not enough. The Coast Guard has estimated a \nneed for $5.4 billion over 10 years for port facility upgrades, and \n$7.3 billion over 10 years for all port security. At the same time, the \nadministration only requested $600 million for infrastructure \nprotection in fiscal year 2006, and this meager figure does not even \nspecify a dedicated portion for port security grants.\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\n  With over 40 percent of the Nation's goods imported through \nCalifornia's ports, a terrorist attack at a California port would not \nonly be tragic but would be devastating for our Nation's economy.\n  So, today, I am reintroducing a bill to provide more funding to the \nports. Specifically, it will create a Port Security Grant Program in \nthe Department of Homeland Security; provide $800 million per year for \n5 years in grant funding; and--this is very important to California's \nports--allow the Federal Government to help finance larger multi-year \nprojects similar to what is done with many of our airports for aviation \nsecurity.\n  I hope that the Senate will act on this bill. Now is not the time to \nslow down or delay our efforts to increase and improve transportation \nsecurity. The job is not done, and it must be done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 1033. A bill to improve border security and immigration; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, after more than 5 months of work, I am \npleased to be joined by Senators Kennedy, Brownback, Lieberman, Graham, \nand Salazar in introducing the Secure America and Orderly Immigration \nAct. This bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform legislation is \ndesigned to fix our Nation's broken immigration system. This landmark \nlegislation would bring common sense to the current system and promote \nour national security interests. I am equally pleased by the effort of \nCongressmen Kolbe, Flake, and Gutierrez who are introducing the House \ncompanion bill.\n  While in previous years we worked independently on immigration reform \nlegislation, we are coming together today to introduce what we believe \nis groundbreaking, comprehensive legislation. Over a year ago, the \nPresident laid out a framework for what comprehensive immigration \nreform should look like. We have used the President's framework to \ncraft this package and I applaud the President for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  The simple fact is that America's immigration system is broken. \nRecent vigilante activities along the southwestern border have shown \nthat the current situation is not sustainable. Americans are frustrated \nwith our lack of border security and our inability to control illegal \nimmigration. We have spent billions of dollars on border enforcement. \nWe have sent more, but still not enough, Federal agents to the border \nequipped with sophisticated technology. We have worked to harden the \nborder in key places. And yet, illegal immigration continues.\n  I would like to mention some startling statistics that demonstrate \nthe critical need for immigration reform. I think the numbers speak for \nthemselves: Over 300 people died last year trying to cross the border; \nabout 200 of those deaths occurred in Arizona's desert. Last year 1.1 \nmillion illegal immigrants were caught by the Border Patrol in 2004. \nFifty-one percent of those were caught in Arizona. The Border Patrol is \ncurrently apprehending over 1,000 undocumented immigrants a day in \nArizona. According to the FBI, an increasing number of these \nindividuals are OTMs, Other Than Mexicans, from ``countries of \ninterest.''\n  Homeland security is our Nation's number one priority, and this \nlegislation includes numerous provisions that together will make our \nnation more secure. This bill includes provisions to strengthen border \nsecurity, both on our side of the border and throughout this \nhemisphere. Through the establishment of a new electronic employment \nverification system, the bill will create a more secure mechanism to \nbetter enforce our nation's immigration laws within our borders. \nAdditionally, the bill enhances the authority of the Department of \nLabor and the Department of Homeland Security to conduct random audits \nto ensure that employers are holding up their end of the bargain. And \nif they aren't, they face double fines.\n  Make no mistake, this is not an amnesty bill. We are not here to \nreward law-breakers, and any accusations to the contrary are patently \nuntrue. This bill recognizes the problems inherent in the current \nsystem and provides a logical and effective means to address these \nproblems. The reality is, there are an estimated million undocumented \npeople living and working in this country. It would be impossible to \nidentify and round up all 10 to 11 million of the current undocumented, \nand if we did, it would ground our Nation's economy to a halt. These \nmillions of people are working. Aliens will not come forward to simply \n``report and deport.'' We have a national interest in identifying these \nindividuals, incentivizing them to come forward out of the shadows, go \nthrough security background checks, pay back taxes, pay penalties for \nbreaking the law, learn to speak English, and regularize their status. \nAnyone who thinks this goal can be achieved without providing an \neventual path to a permanent legal status is not serious about solving \nthis problem.\n  Part of the failure of the existing system is its inability to \nprovide sufficient legal channels to pair willing workers with willing \nemployers. This bill establishes a new market-based temporary worker \nprogram so that when there is no U.S. worker to fill a job, employers \nwill be able to hire willing and able foreign workers who have gone \nthrough security background checks, medical exams, and paid a fee for \ntheir visa. And, by doing away with outdated numerical caps on this \nprogram, this bill recognizes that the needs of the U.S. economy are \nconstantly in flux, and our immigration system must match those needs.\n  I don't believe there is another issue that is more important to our \nNation than immigration reform. For far too long, our Nation's broken \nimmigration laws have gone unreformed, leaving Americans vulnerable. We \ncan no longer afford to delay reform.\n  The complex and difficult problems associated with immigration reform \nwill not be solved overnight, but they are among the most difficult \nchallenges facing our Nation today. That is why it is so important that \nthe President shares our commitment to comprehensive reform. Together \nwith the President, I am committed to this process and remain very \nhopeful that we will succeed.\n  I want to especially express my appreciation to Senator Kennedy and \nhis staff for their sincere commitment to this critical issue. Also, \nthe contributions to the bill as recommended by Senator Brownback have \nbeen invaluable to this effort. I would also like to thank Senator \nLugar, who allowed us to incorporate critical international border \nenforcement provisions from his legislation, the North American \nCooperative Security Act.\n  Through the collective efforts of a wide range of bipartisan \ninterests in both Houses of Congress, not to mention immigration \nadvocacy groups, representatives of our Nation's businesses, and \nseveral labor unions, this comprehensive legislation provides a \nmeaningful direction for how our immigration system should be reformed, \nand our border security strengthened.\n  I look forward to working with all interested parties in the \nimportant and necessary effort to once and for all reform our broken \nimmigration system.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor to join Senator McCain and \nCongressmen Gutierrez, Kolbe, and Flake in introducing our bipartisan \nlegislation to reform the Nation's immigration laws. The status quo is \nunacceptable, and legislation is urgently needed to deal with all the \ninadequacies in our current law, to end the suffering of long-separated \nfamilies imposed by the broken system, and to do so in a way that \nreflects current realities.\n  We must modernize our broken immigration system to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century. And we need policies that continue to \nreflect our best values as a nation--fairness, equal opportunity, and \nrespect for the rule of law.\n  One of the mistakes of the past is to assume that we can control \nillegal immigration on our own. A realistic immigration policy must be \na two-way street. Under our plan, America will do its part, but we \nexpect Mexico and other nations to do their part, too, to replace an \nillegal immigration flow with regulated, legal immigration.\n  Our bill will make our immigration policies more realistic and \nenforceable,\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\nrestore legality as the prevailing norm, and make it easier for \nimmigrants to cooperate with local authorities. It will protect the \nlabor rights of all workers, and create an even playing field for \nemployers. It will strengthen our economy, restore control of our \nborders, and improve national security.\n  Much of the Nation's economy today depends on the hard work and the \nmany contributions of immigrants. Many industries depend heavily on \nimmigrant labor. These men and women enrich our Nation and improve the \nquality of our lives. Yet, millions of today's immigrant workers are \nnot here legally. They and their families live shadow lives in constant \nfear of deportation, and easy targets for abuse and exploitation by \nunscrupulous employers and criminals as well. Many risk great danger, \nand even death, to cross our borders.\n  Our bill offers practical solutions to deal with these basic \nproblems. It contains an earned legalization program for immigrants who \nhave been working in the United States for at least 6 years, a way to \nreduce the enormous backlog of petitions to unify immigrant families, \nand a revised temporary worker program. The bill also contains strict \nborder security and enforcement provisions, and measures to ensure that \nother countries do their part by requiring them to help control the \nflow of their citizens to jobs in the United States.\n  We feel the bill is a realistic and practical solution to the complex \nimmigration challenges facing the Nation for so long, and we've worked \nclosely with as many interested groups as possible to make it fair to \nall.\n  Despite our compromises and bipartisan solutions, there are some who \noppose these reforms. They misleadingly categorize our efforts as \n``immigrant amnesty.'' They refuse to accept that these reforms simply \ncreate a legalization program for U.S. workers who have already been \nresiding and working in the U.S. It is not a guarantee of citizenship, \nbut an opportunity to continue working hard, start playing by the \nrules, and earn permanent residency.\n  And by bringing immigrants out of the shadows so they can earn a fair \nday's pay for a fair day's work, we are protecting American workers' \nrights and wages, too.\n  The legal status must be earned by proving past work contributions, \nmaking a substantial future work commitment, and paying of $2,000 in \npenalties.\n  First, workers will receive temporary resident status, based on their \npast work contributions. To earn permanent residence, they must work 6 \nmore years. Otherwise, they will be dropped from the program and \nrequired to leave the country.\n  It's not an amnesty for them, because they have to earn it. We offer \na fair deal: if they are willing to work hard for us openly, then we're \nwilling to do something fair for them. It is the only realistic \nsolution.\n  If there's any amnesty involved, it's what they have today--an \nacquiescence in their presence, because countless businesses could not \nfunction without them since no American workers can be found to fill \ntheir jobs. To be eligible for legal status, applicants must have no \ncriminal or national security problems. All will be required to undergo \nrigorous security clearances. Their names will be checked against the \ngovernment's criminal and terrorist databases, and the applicant's \nfingerprints will be sent to the FBI for a thorough background check.\n  It's long past time to put the underground economy above ground, and \nrecognize the reality of immigrants in our workforce. It's the only way \nto achieve effective enforcement rules to protect and strengthen our \nlabor system, and to stabilize our workforce for employers.\n  Our bill allows long-term, tax-paying immigrant workers to apply for \nearned adjustment of status. Studies show that there are now millions \nof illegal immigrants working in the U.S., and it would be \nirresponsible to continue to ignore this hidden past of our economic \nlandscape.\n  Our bill is also about fairness. It ensures that the rights of all \nworkers are protected--that the rights to organize, to change jobs \nbetween employers, and to have fair wages, fair hours, and fair working \nconditions--cannot be denied. Through this legislation, America can be \nproud again that our Nation protects the safety and rights of all our \nworkers.\n  Our legislation is also about protecting families. Family unity has \nalways been a fundamental cornerstone of America's immigration policy. \nYet, millions of individuals today are waiting for immigrant visas to \njoin with their families.\n  Our bill will allow these families to be reunited more quickly and \nhumanely. It also removes and amends unnecessary obstacles in current \nlaw that separate families, such as the affidavit-of-support \nrequirements and the rigid bars to admissibility. Our bill contains \nprovisions that will expedite visas to reunite spouses and children of \nlegal immigrants with their loved ones. It also provides measures to \nclear up the backlog of employment-based visas.\n  In addition, this bill recognizes the need for strong border \nprotection and enforcement as part of immigration reform. It directs \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to develop and implement a National \nStrategy for Border Security to coordinate the efforts of Federal, \nState, local, and tribal authorities on border management and security. \nThe Strategy will identify the areas most in need of enforcement and \npropose cost-effective ways to defend the border, including better ways \nof technology, improved intelligence-sharing and coordination. It also \nincludes plans to combat human smuggling.\n  To further improve border enforcement, the bill improves the security \nof Mexico's southern border and assesses the needs of Central American \ngovernments in securing their borders. It provides a framework for \nbetter management, communication, coordination, and immigration control \nfor all our governments, and encourages other governments to control \nalien smuggling and trafficking, prevent the use and manufacture of \nfraudulent travel documents, and share relevant information.\n  The bill also encourages so-called circular migration patterns. It \nprovides for unprecedented cooperation with the governments of the \nUnited States, Canada, Mexico, and other Central American countries on \nissues of migration. It asks foreign countries to enter into agreements \nwith the U.S. to help control the flow of their citizens to jobs in the \nU.S., with emphasis on encouraging the re-integration of citizens \nreturning home.\n  It also encourages the U.S. government to partner with Mexico to \npromote economic opportunity back home and reduce the pressure for its \ncitizens to immigrate to the U.S. It encourages partnership between the \nU.S. and Mexico on health care, so that we are not unfairly burdened by \nthe cost of administering health care to Mexican nationals.\n  Further, the bill mandates that immigration-related documents issued \nby DHS be biometric, machine-readable, and tamper-resistant. It creates \nan Employment Eligibility Confirmation System, so that employers can \nverify an employee's identity and employment authorization, and an \nimproved system to collect entry and exit data to determine the status \nof aliens after their arrival to and departure from the U.S. It \nprotects against immigration fraud by improving regulations on who may \nappear in immigration matters.\n  Another important component of our bill is its State Criminal Alien \nAssistance Program, to reimburse states for the direct and indirect \ncosts of incarcerating illegal aliens.\n  We know that these reforms are long overdue. The illegal workers here \ntoday are not leaving, and new ones continue to come in. A significant \npart of the workforce in many sectors of the economy, especially \nagriculture, is undocumented. Massive deportations are unrealistic as \npolicy, impractical to carry out, and unacceptable to businesses that \nrely heavily on their labor.\n  Americans want and deserve realistic solutions to the very real \nimmigration problems we face. They don't want open borders, and they \ndon't want closed borders. They want smart borders, which mean fair and \nrealistic immigration laws that can actually be enforced, immigration \nlaws that protect our security, respect our ideals, and honor our \nheritage as a Nation of immigrants.\n  America has been the Promised Land for generations of immigrants who\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nhave found haven, hope, opportunity and freedom here. Immigrants have \nalways been an indispensable part of our Nation. They have contributed \nimmensely to our communities, created new jobs and whole new \nindustries, served in our armed forces, paid their taxes, and help make \nAmerica the continuing land of promise it is today.\n  It's obvious why the Nation's founders chose ``E Pluribus Unum''--\n``out of many, one'' as America's motto two centuries ago. These words, \nchosen by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson, referred \nto their ideal that tiny quarreling colonies could be transformed into \none Nation, with one destiny. That basic ideal applies to individuals \nas well. Our diversity is our greatest strength.\n  We are a Nation of immigrants, and we always will be, and our laws \nmust be true to that proud heritage. Our bipartisan bill attempts to do \nthat, and I look forward to working with the Administration and our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact it into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5171-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 136--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF MAY 2005 AS ``NATIONAL \n                           DRUG COURT MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Coburn) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 141\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of mental retardation in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas the economic cost of fetal alcohol syndrome alone \n     to the Nation was $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated \n     that each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost \n     United States taxpayers between $1,500,000 and $3,000,000 in \n     his or her lifetime;\n       Whereas in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2005, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies to--\n       (i) promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure \n     to alcohol;\n       (ii) increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) ensure healthier communities across the United States; \n     and\n       (B) observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2005, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5172-3", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5172-S5173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 32--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   THE GOVERNMENT OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION SHOULD ISSUE A CLEAR AND \n  UNAMBIGUOUS STATEMENT OF ADMISSION AND CONDEMNATION OF THE ILLEGAL \nOCCUPATION AND ANNEXATION BY THE SOVIET UNION FROM 1940 TO 1991 OF THE \n           BALTIC COUNTRIES OF ESTONIA, LATVIA, AND LITHUANIA\n\n  Mr. SMITH (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 137, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 137) designating May 1, 2005, as \n     ``National Child Care Worthy Wage Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the resolution.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nLautenberg, Bingaman, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, Inouye, Kerry, Boxer and \nKennedy, to speak about a resolution supporting National Child Care \nWorthy Wage Day. It is my hope that it will bring attention to early \nchildhood education and the importance of attracting and retaining \nqualified childcare workers.\n  Every day, approximately 13 million children are cared for outside \nthe home so that their parents can work. This figure includes 6 million \nof our Nation's infants and toddlers. Children begin to learn at birth, \nand the quality of care they receive will affect them for the rest of \ntheir lives. Early childcare affects language development, math skills, \nsocial behavior, and general readiness for school. Experienced \nchildcare workers can identify children who have development or \nemotional problems and provide the care they need to take on life's \nchallenges. Through the creative use of play, structured activities and \nindividual attention, childcare workers help young children learn about \nthe world around them and how to interact with others. They also teach \nthe skills children will need to be ready to read and to learn when \nthey go to school.\n  Unfortunately, despite the importance of their work, the committed \nindividuals who nurture and teach our Nation's young children are \nundervalued. The average salary of a childcare worker is just under \n$18,000 annually. In 1998, the middle 50 percent of child care workers \nand preschool teachers earned between $5.82 and $8.13 an hour, \naccording to the Department of Labor. The lowest 10 percent of \nchildcare workers were paid an hourly rate of $5.49 or less. Only one \nthird of our Nation's childcare workers have health insurance and even \nfewer have\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\npension plans. This grossly inadequate level of wages and benefits for \nchildcare staff has led to difficulties in attracting and retaining \nquality caretakers and educators. As a result, the turnover rate for \nchildcare providers is 30 percent a year. This high turnover rate \ninterrupts consistent and stable relationships that children need to \nhave with their caregivers.\n  If we want our children cared for by qualified providers with higher \ndegrees and more training, we will have to make sure they are \nadequately compensated. Otherwise, we will continue to lose early \nchildhood educators with BA degrees to kindergarten and first grade, \nlosing some of our best teachers of young children from the early years \nof learning.\n  In order to bring attention to childcare workers, I am sponsoring a \nresolution that would designate May as National Child Care Worthy Wage \nDay. On May 1 each year, childcare providers and other early childhood \nprofessionals nationwide conduct public awareness and education efforts \nhighlighting the importance of good early childhood education.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in recognizing the importance of \nthe work and professionalism that childcare workers provide and the \nneed to increase their compensation accordingly. The Nation's childcare \nworkforce, the families who depend on them, and the children they care \nfor, deserve our support.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 139 submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 139) expressing support for the \n     withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on April 9, 1991, the Republic of Georgia \ndeclared its independence from the Soviet Union. Later that December, \nit was formally recognized by the international community as a \nsovereign and independent nation.\n  Throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union stationed troops and \nmaintained military bases in many of the republics and countries along \nits border. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, most of these \nforces withdrew to Russia and former Soviet military bases were closed.\n  Today, however, more than a decade after obtaining its independence, \nGeorgia has not been able to rid itself of the Russian military \npresence. Several years ago, Russia pledged to withdraw its military \npersonnel and close its military bases in Georgia. However, Russia has \nfailed to fulfill its commitments. More than 3,000 Russian troops are \nstill present in Georgia.\n  It is time for these forces to leave. I urge Russia's leaders to \nrespect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia, to \nfulfill its obligations, and work with Georgia's leaders to end its \nmilitary presence there.\n  In November 2003, the people of Georgia demonstrated their desire to \nfree themselves of the bonds of foreign domination.\n  They peacefully protested fraudulent elections and succeeded in \ninstalling a government committed to democracy, human rights, and the \nrule of law. The Rose Revolution was a triumph for freedom and has \ntruly been an inspiration to us all.\n  Georgia's President Mikheil Saakashvili and the Government and people \nof Georgia have exhibited steadfast determination in their efforts to \nregain their sovereignty and protect their new democracy.\n  The United States should continue to support the Georgian people as \nthey work to strengthen their democratic institutions and end Russia's \nmilitary presence.\n  I applaud President Bush for his recent visit to the Georgia \nRepublic. And I wholeheartedly support his commitment to the spread of \nfreedom and democracy in the states of the former Soviet Union.\n  President Saakashvili and the people of Georgia deserve deep \nadmiration for their extraordinary accomplishment. I\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nam confident that their example will continue to inspire millions \naround the world who hope for a future of freedom and prosperity.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the support of the Senate in \napproving this resolution regarding the territorial integrity of \nGeorgia. It is important that the Senate speak on this matter with one \nvoice and at this time, as President Bush just wrapped up his trip to \nEurope and Russia with a 2-day visit to Tiblisi, Georgia.\n  I was in Georgia 6 weeks ago. I went there at the urging of the \nformer Prime Minister, who died tragically in an accident several \nmonths ago. The Prime Minister came to visit me here in my Capitol \noffice, and he described his country to me: mountainous, filled with \nhistoric churches, strategically important, and a friend to the United \nStates. ``You have to go there,'' he said. I promised him that I would \ngo there, and even after he died, I wanted to fulfill that commitment.\n  And after having spent 2 days and nights in Georgia, I can say that \nthe Prime Minister's description was right on the mark. Georgia is a \nbeautiful country, with an incredible history and stunning \narchitecture. Above all, the Georgian people have a wonderful spirit.\n  Less than years ago, Georgia underwent the peaceful ``Rose \nRevolution.'' A group of young, thoughtful and energetic reformers took \non the corrupt leaders of the Soviet era, denying them an opportunity \nto steal a parliamentary election. Thousands gathered in Freedom \nSquare, night after night, to expose the fraud and criminality of the \nprevious regime. From that point on, there was no turning back. \nDemocracy had finally arrived in Georgia.\n  But Georgian sovereignty and independence has been put at some risk \nrecently through the continued basing of Russian troops on Georgian \nsoil. Previous agreements negotiated with the Russian government \ncalling for the complete withdrawal of Russian troops have been \nignored. Some 3,000 Russian military personnel still remain in Georgia. \nIt is time for them to go. I am confident that President Bush carried \nthat message to President Putin during his recent visit.\n  I am glad we could pass this Resolution calling on Russia to support \nthe territorial integrity of Georgia, and expressing our support for \nthe Georgian people and their pursuit of democracy. Georgia is our \nfriend, our ally and our strategic partner. Passage of this resolution \nsends exactly the right message to the Russian Government and to the \npeople of Georgia. Again, I appreciate the support of my colleagues and \nI commend the President for his decision to visit Georgia. I know he \nwas as well received as our Senate delegation was.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record, \nwithout intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 139) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 139\n\n       Whereas, on April 9, 1991, the Republic of Georgia declared \n     independence from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics;\n       Whereas, during December 1991, the Republic of Georgia was \n     internationally recognized as an independent and sovereign \n     country following the formal dissolution of the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics;\n       Whereas the disposition of former Soviet troops stationed \n     in certain newly independent countries was resolved by 1994 \n     with the complete withdrawal of Russian Federation military \n     personnel from the Republics of Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania;\n       Whereas in the years following the restoration of Georgian \n     independence, successive governments of Georgia sought to \n     negotiate the closure of Russian military bases located in, \n     and the withdrawal of military personnel from, Georgia;\n       Whereas, during the Organization for Security and Co-\n     operation in Europe summit at Istanbul, Turkey in 1999, \n     Georgia and Russia concluded a bilateral agreement as part of \n     the Adapted Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty;\n       Whereas as part of such bilateral agreement, which is known \n     as the ``Istanbul Commitments'', on November 17, 1999, Russia \n     committed to close bases at Gudauta and Vaziani by July 1, \n     2001, and committed to conclude negotiations on bases at \n     Batumi and Akhalkalaki, and all other Russian military \n     facilities during 2000;\n       Whereas Russia has failed to fulfill its obligations under \n     the Istanbul Commitments;\n       Whereas more than 3,000 Russian military personnel remain \n     in Georgia at various bases and facilities throughout the \n     country;\n       Whereas, during November 2003, the Georgian people, in the \n     historic ``Rose Revolution'', peacefully protested fraudulent \n     elections resulting in the holding of new elections and the \n     installation of a new government committed to democracy, the \n     rule of law, observance of human rights, restoration of \n     sovereignty, and economic development; and\n       Whereas on March 10, 2005, the democratically elected \n     Parliament of the Republic of Georgia passed a measure \n     expressing its dissatisfaction with Russia's continued \n     military presence in Georgia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the Russian Federation should respect the territorial \n     integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Georgia;\n       (B) President Mikheil Saakashvili and the Government and \n     people of Georgia deserve congratulations for the \n     accomplishments and successful reforms carried out in Georgia \n     since President Mikheil Saakashvili's inauguration in January \n     2004, and that the United States should continue to support \n     such reforms and should encourage and assist Georgia with \n     strengthening its democratic institutions and resolving its \n     separatist conflicts peacefully; and\n       (C) the United States should continue to support Georgia in \n     its efforts to negotiate an agreement for ending Russia's \n     military presence in Georgia, in accordance with Russia's \n     obligations under the bilateral agreement made between Russia \n     and Georgia as part of the Adapted Conventional Forces in \n     Europe Treaty known as the ``Istanbul Commitments''; and\n       (2) the Senate--\n       (A) supports the efforts of President Bush to encourage \n     Russia and Georgia to expeditiously reach agreement on the \n     closure of Russian military bases in, and the withdrawal of \n     military personnel from, Georgia;\n       (B) commends President Bush for being the first United \n     States President to visit Georgia since its recognition as an \n     independent and sovereign country; and\n       (C) will continue to monitor the situation in Georgia \n     closely.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5183-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR GREATER WASHINGTON SOAP BOX \n                                 DERBY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SPECIAL \n                   OLYMPICS LAW ENFORCEMENT TORCH RUN\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    AUTHORIZING USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS FOR NATIONAL PEACE OFFICERS' \n                            MEMORIAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 141, which was submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 141) designating September 9, 2005, \n     as ``National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness \n     Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. On Wednesday, May 18, parents of children afflicted \nwith Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders and their advocates will travel \nto our Nation's Capital for the Second Annual FASD Hill Day. FASD Hill \nDay is sponsored by the National Organization on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \nand organizations that support those who care for FASD children in our \nStates and communities.\n  Nobody knows better than a parent of a child afflicted with FASD how \nchallenging it is to raise a child who\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nwas exposed to alcohol before birth. Nobody knows better the physical, \nmental, behavioral and learning disabilities that can have lifelong \nimplications. I would urge my colleagues to open their offices to the \nparents and advocates who participate in FASD Hill Day because they \nhave a very important story to tell. Their stories will move you.\n  At the conclusion of FASD Hill Day, the National Organization on \nFetal Alcohol Syndrome will host its annual Leadership Awards Benefit \nReception. All of the parents and advocates are invited to participate. \nI am pleased to inform my colleagues that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, and our distinguished colleague from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, will receive the 2005 Leadership Award at the benefit \nreception. As a Senator who represents a State with one of the highest \nincidence rates of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, I appreciate the \nleadership of Senator Durbin and Senator Enzi, and the support of all \nof our colleagues, in the crusade to eradicate fetal alcohol spectrum \ndisorders.\n  The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, or FASD, was coined by \nexperts as an umbrella term to describe the range of effects that can \noccur in an individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. It \nrefers to conditions such as fetal alcohol syndrome, fetal alcohol \neffects, alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-\nrelated birth defects.\n  The only cause of FASD is alcohol use during pregnancy. When a \npregnant woman drinks, the alcohol crosses the placenta into the fetal \nblood system. Thus, alcohol reaches the fetus, its developing tissues \nand organs. This is how brain damage occurs, which in turn can lead to \nmental retardation, social and emotional problems, learning \ndisabilities and other problems. In fact, FASD is the leading cause of \nmental retardation in all of western civilization, including the United \nStates.\n  Since the only cause of FASD is prenatal alcohol consumption it \nfollows that by abstaining from the consumption of alcohol during \npregnancy a woman can completely foreclose the possibility that her \nbaby will be born with one or another of the conditions that are \nregarded fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.\n  Every day of the year we must remind women that no amount of alcohol \nconsumed during pregnancy is safe for their baby. No alcohol during \npregnancy is safe. None at all.\n  To dramatize this point, a group of parents who were raising children \nafflicted with fetal alcohol came together on the Internet and wondered \nin cyberspace, ``What if a world full of FAS and FAE parents all got \ntogether on the 9th hour of the 9th day of the 9th month of the year \nand asked the world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \nwoman should not consume alcohol?'' If this were to occur, they \nwondered, ``Would the world listen?''\n\n  On the 9th hour of the 9th day of the 9th month every year they \ncalled upon all the peoples of the world to observe a moment of silence \nto remind women of childbearing age that no amount of alcohol is safe \nduring pregnancy.\n  These pioneering activists, most of whom were adoptive and foster \nparents, led by Brian Philcox and Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, and \nTeresa Kellerman of Tucson, AZ, did not have the resources of large \npublic relations firms or well connected lobbyists. They organized the \nfirst International FAS Awareness Day, which was observed on September \n9, 1999, on a shoestring using the Internet. Rapidly their group grew \nto include more than 70 volunteer coordinators in eight countries. Each \nyear I receive e-mails from places like New Zealand, Germany, and my \nown State of Alaska, telling me about their local FAS Day observances. \nThrough this grassroots awareness effort, many women of childbearing \nage learned for the first time that no amount of alcohol in pregnancy \nis good.\n  On September 9, 2004, for the first time, the moment of silence was \nobserved on the Senate floor. I would hope that this would become an \nannual tradition until fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are eradicated.\n  The resolution that I have introduced today designates September 9, \n2005, as National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Awareness Day. Although \nSeptember 9 is several months off, I have asked that the resolution be \nconsidered at this time as a tribute to the efforts of the FASD parents \nand advocates who have come to Washington, DC, educate all of us about \nthe dangers of alcohol and pregnancy and to provide them with a tool to \nencourage each of their communities to observe and participate in \nFASDAY 2005 when they return home.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 141) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 141\n\n       Whereas the term ``fetal alcohol spectrum disorders'' \n     includes a broader range of conditions and therefore has \n     replaced the term ``fetal alcohol syndrome'' as the umbrella \n     term describing the range of effects that can occur in an \n     individual whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the leading \n     cause of mental retardation in western civilization, \n     including the United States, and are 100 percent preventable;\n       Whereas fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a major cause \n     of numerous social disorders, including learning \n     disabilities, school failure, juvenile delinquency, \n     homelessness, unemployment, mental illness, and crime;\n       Whereas the incidence rate of fetal alcohol syndrome is \n     estimated at 1 out of 500 live births and the incidence rate \n     of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders is estimated at 1 out of \n     every 100 live births;\n       Whereas the economic cost of fetal alcohol syndrome alone \n     to the Nation was $5,400,000,000 in 2003 and it is estimated \n     that each individual with fetal alcohol syndrome will cost \n     United States taxpayers between $1,500,000 and $3,000,000 in \n     his or her lifetime;\n       Whereas in February 1999, a small group of parents of \n     children who suffer from fetal alcohol spectrum disorders \n     came together with the hope that in 1 magic moment the world \n     could be made aware of the devastating consequences of \n     alcohol consumption during pregnancy;\n       Whereas the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     Awareness Day was observed on September 9, 1999;\n       Whereas Bonnie Buxton of Toronto, Canada, the co-founder of \n     the first International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day, \n     asked ``What if . . . a world full of FAS/E [Fetal Alcohol \n     Syndrome/Effect] parents all got together on the ninth hour \n     of the ninth day of the ninth month of the year and asked the \n     world to remember that during the 9 months of pregnancy a \n     woman should not consume alcohol . . . would the rest of the \n     world listen?''; and\n       Whereas on the ninth day of the ninth month of each year \n     since 1999, communities around the world have observed \n     International Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Awareness Day: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 9, 2005, as ``National Fetal \n     Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to--\n       (A) observe National Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders \n     Awareness Day with appropriate ceremonies to--\n       (i) promote awareness of the effects of prenatal exposure \n     to alcohol;\n       (ii) increase compassion for individuals affected by \n     prenatal exposure to alcohol;\n       (iii) minimize further effects of prenatal exposure to \n     alcohol; and\n       (iv) ensure healthier communities across the United States; \n     and\n       (B) observe a moment of reflection on the ninth hour of \n     September 9, 2005, to remember that during the 9 months of \n     pregnancy a woman should not consume alcohol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5184-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MAY 13, 2005\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

We are now on a glidepath to \ncomplete work on this legislation early next week, and I do want to \nthank all Members for their hard work and cooperation.\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\n  With that being said, there is still work to be done. The bill \nmanagers will be here tomorrow morning to receive the final few \namendments. There will be no rollcall votes tomorrow, but I encourage \nthose Members who have amendments on the final list to come to the \nfloor tomorrow to offer and debate their amendments. We will be voting \non Monday evening, and that would be the next rollcall vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/05/12/senate-section/article/S5185-1", "month": "05", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
