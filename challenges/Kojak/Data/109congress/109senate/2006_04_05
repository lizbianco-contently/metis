Mr. President, this morning, we are returning to the \nborder security bill which has been pending since last Wednesday. Last \nnight, the minority leader filed a cloture motion on the chairman's \nsubstitute amendment. I was a little surprised when I heard this \nhappened, although I was not on the floor when it was filed. I \ncertainly understand the rules that permit the minority leader to file \nthis motion. I know it is a rare occurrence when the minority leader \nfiles such a cloture motion, and at this point he did on the bill. I \nbelieve we can make real progress on addressing the amendments if we \nallow them to come forward, debate them openly, and then vote on them. \nWe do still have the first amendment which was offered to the bill last \nweek pending before the Senate; that is, the Kyl-Cornyn amendment on \nwhich we voted on the motion to table last night, 0 to 99--a unanimous \nvote. The motion had been made and it was not tabled; therefore, it is \nthe pending amendment. We have three other amendments Senators have \noffered and debated, but we have not been given the opportunity to vote \non those.\n  As I said at the outset of the debate last week, my intention was to \ngive ample time to have amendments come forward, to debate, to fully \nunderstand what is in the Judiciary bill, to modify the Judiciary bill \nby debate and amendment. I encourage Members to come to the floor to do \njust that, to offer their amendments. Members show up, and then there \nis an objection to even offering the amendments from the other side. I \nspecifically set aside these weeks for the Senate to debate this \nparticular issue, the border security and immigration issue, because it \nis one that is important to the safety of the American people, the \nsecurity of the Nation, and fairness to immigrants. We are a nation of \nlaws, and we are a rich nation of immigrants. Both of those principles \nneed to be respected in the debate, but we can only do so by making \nsure that the laws we pass are upheld and that we address the people \nwho have broken the law. That can be done in a comprehensive bill, and \nwe have to have debate and amendment.\n\n  The debate over security on our borders and handling immigration has \ngenerated a lot of ideas. The debate has matured, and we have had good \ndebate on the floor. Now we have the attention of all 100 Senators and \npeople around the country looking at what we do. They expect us to \nlegislate, to address the very real problems that are out there today, \nand that requires debate and amendment.\n  If you look at other large bills we have done, the Medicare \nprescription drug bill, we had 128 amendments considered; the Energy \nbill, we had 60 or 70 amendments considered; on the highway bill, 47 \namendments; bankruptcy reform, 61 amendments. It is important that we \ndebate these amendments and act on them. We just can't sit on the side \nlines; the problem is too big, too important. It is growing. An \nestimated 3 million people crossed our southwestern borders illegally \nlast year, and we don't know who they are. We don't know what their \nintentions are. We need to bring a rational, fair framework to assist a \nsystem that is just flatout broken. That is our responsibility.\n\n[[Page S2850]]\n\n  Today is a new day, and we are just getting started. With that, I \nhope we will have the opportunity to start afresh. The two managers \nlast night indicated they would be working together and would try to \nwork out a list of amendments to be voted upon. I assume those would \ninclude the amendments that were offered last week. I would hope that \nthey are. I encourage them to work out a process to give Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle the chance to offer amendments and to have them \nvoted upon so that we can complete that path to finishing a bill which \nis critically important to the safety and security of the American \npeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2850-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 2454, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2454) to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to provide for comprehensive reform and for other \n     purposes.\n  Pending:\n\n       Specter/Leahy amendment No. 3192, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Kyl/Cornyn amendment No. 3206 (to amendment No. 3192), to \n     make certain aliens ineligible for conditional nonimmigrant \n     work authorization and status.\n       Cornyn amendment No. 3207 (to amendment No. 3206), to \n     establish an enactment date.\n       Isakson amendment No. 3215 (to amendment No. 3192), to \n     demonstrate respect for legal immigration by prohibiting the \n     implementation of a new alien guest worker program until the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security certifies to the President and \n     the Congress that the borders of the United States are \n     reasonably sealed and secured.\n       Dorgan amendment No. 3223 (to amendment No. 3192), to allow \n     United States citizens under 18 years of age to travel to \n     Canada without a passport, to develop a system to enable \n     United States citizens to take 24-hour excursions to Canada \n     without a passport, and to limit the cost of passport cards \n     or similar alternatives to passports to $20.\n       Mikulski/Warner amendment No. 3217 (to amendment No. 3192), \n     to extend the termination date for the exemption of returning \n     workers from the numerical limitations for temporary workers.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have worked on trying to break the \nimpasse, and staff for Senator Leahy and myself worked late last night \nand have a number of amendments where both sides think we can argue \nthem, debate them, and vote on them. But we have still not resolved the \nissue as to what to do with certain pending amendments. It was my hope \nthat the pending amendments would be included in the list, but that was \nnot to be the case. We have debated the Kyl-Cornyn amendment. It is my \nthought that we ought to vote on that amendment. But that is objected \nto by the Democrats. In order to proceed to consideration and votes on \nother amendments, we have to set aside the Kyl-Cornyn amendment. \nSenator Kyl is understandably concerned about setting aside his \namendment, that he will not have an opportunity to vote on it. So we \nare still working to try to resolve the issue.\n  I have just had a short discussion with the distinguished Democratic \nleader. We are prepared to move ahead, not as usefully as we might but \nat least to use floor time on matters which we would have later. We \nhave agreed that Senator Santorum would be recognized to lay down an \namendment and speak about it and that Senator Nelson of Florida would \nlay down an amendment and speak about it. In the interim, we are \ncontinuing to talk to see if we can resolve our differences of opinion.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Santorum \nwould lay down his amendment, speak on it for whatever time he feels \nappropriate. Following the termination of his remarks, the Senator from \nFlorida would be recognized, or someone on his behalf, to lay down \namendment No. 3220 and speak for whatever time he thought appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is my understanding as well. So we have agreed upon \nsomething.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent on that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3214\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3214 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum], for himself \n     and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 3214.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To designate Poland as a program country under the visa \n  waiver program established under section 217 of the Immigration and \n                            Nationality Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. DESIGNATION OF POLAND AS A VISA WAIVER COUNTRY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the founding of the United States, Poland has \n     proven its steadfast dedication to the causes of freedom and \n     friendship with the United States, exemplified by the brave \n     actions of Polish patriots such as Casimir Pulaski and \n     Tadeusz Kosciuszko during the American Revolution.\n       (2) Polish history provides pioneering examples of \n     constitutional democracy and religious tolerance.\n       (3) The United States is home to nearly 9,000,000 people of \n     Polish ancestry.\n       (4) Polish immigrants have contributed greatly to the \n     success of industry and agriculture in the United States.\n       (5) Since the demise of communism, Poland has become a \n     stable, democratic nation.\n       (6) Poland has adopted economic policies that promote free \n     markets and rapid economic growth.\n       (7) On March 12, 1999, Poland demonstrated its commitment \n     to global security by becoming a member of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization.\n       (8) On May 1, 2004, Poland became a member state of the \n     European Union.\n       (9) Poland was a staunch ally to the United States during \n     Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       (10) Poland has committed 2,300 soldiers to help with \n     ongoing peacekeeping efforts in Iraq.\n       (11) The Secretary of State and the Secretary administer \n     the visa waiver program, which allows citizens from 27 \n     countries, including France and Germany, to visit the United \n     States as tourists without visas.\n       (12) On April 15, 1991, Poland unilaterally repealed the \n     visa requirement for United States citizens traveling to \n     Poland for 90 days or less.\n       (13) More than 100,000 Polish citizens visit the United \n     States each year.\n       (b) Visa Waiver Program.--Effective on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, and notwithstanding section 217(c) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187(c)), \n     Poland shall be deemed a designated program country for \n     purposes of the visa waiver program established under section \n     217 of such Act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Pennsylvania \nis recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, this is an amendment offered along with \nSenator Mikulski on the Polish visa waiver program. This is an issue I \nhave talked about on numerous occasions along with Senator Mikulski. We \nhave concern that one of our best allies--in fact, one of our \nstaunchest allies--has great concerns about the way they are being \ntreated in the United States with respect to the visa waiver program.\n  The visa waiver program is available to 27 countries around the \nworld. That allows citizens from those countries to travel in the \nUnited States for vacation and visiting families, et cetera, without \nrequiring a visa. This is a program which is given to countries which \nwe have a special relationship with and which are able to meet certain \ncriteria laid out in the law and have been certified by the Department \nof State as having met that criteria.\n  Poland, so far, has not been able to meet the criteria that has been \nlaid out in statute, although I will say that when Senator Mikulski and \nI introduced this in the last session and\n\n[[Page S2851]]\n\npushed for its adoption, I think we energized the administration and \nState Department to get to work and try to find a way for us to meet \nthe Poles halfway with respect to getting them into the visa waiver \nprogram.\n  I am very pleased to see that last year, they were again writing \nletters, putting on pressure, threatening to bring this bill up for \npurposes of passage. We brought it up in the 108th Congress and tried \nto pass it. Unfortunately, there was an objection on the other side of \nthe aisle. We cleared it here, and I think there is broad support for \ntaking a country--and it is now 25 years since the strike at the Gdansk \nShipyard. There has been a tremendous change in this country which was \nbrought about by real freedom fighters, led at the time by Lech Walesa \nand subsequent leaders to establish a stable democracy there--a \ndemocracy that is thriving and one that had an election recently and \nelected a new President. It is a President who I believe will continue \nto have very strong ties to the United States.\n  I know the Polish people. I have a lot of Poles in my State, and they \ntell me they travel over there, and the sentiment and feeling toward \nAmerica is very strong. There is support for us in the war on terror, \nas strong as any country in the world. They have been a terrific ally \nduring this period of time.\n  Obviously, the contribution the Polish Americans have made to this \ncountry, from Revolutionary War times all the way through today, is \nquite striking and important. So we have a country that has made \nfundamental changes toward democracy and toward a free market economy, \nwhich is doing relatively well, a country that we have so much in \ncommon with. Yet while almost all of the European Union countries \nparticipate in the visa waiver program, unfortunately, Poland has not \nbeen granted that waiver.\n  The President, last year, in response to the activity here in \nCongress, was able to put together what is called the roadmap. The \nroadmap was negotiated on February 9 of last year with then-President \nKwasniewski. He laid out some very real steps to try to help give \nPoland another chance to show that they are prepared to meet the \nrequirements of the law.\n  Unfortunately, we still have a situation where we have very high \nrefusal rates. That is one of the criteria, but I am not too sure it is \na good criterion. It basically trusts a bureaucrat in an embassy in \nPoland to determine whether someone should enter this country for the \npurpose of travel. When they are refused, for whatever reason, that \nadds to the refusal rate, and that rate is high. I don't know whether \nthe embassy there is tougher or what. Also, the refusal rate sometimes \nis not reflective of the actual percentage of people who are trying to \ncome here and are refused. If 1 person wants to come and asks 10 times, \nthat is 10 refusals, not 1. To me, that also can skew the number of \nrefusals.\n  I am just suggesting that I think we have a special case here. \nCongress has done this in the past with Ireland. Congress stepped \nforward, and we pushed the executive branch at that time to allow \nIreland into the visa waiver program. I think it is time for us, given \nthe tremendous support we have gotten from the Polish people, the \ntremendous relationship between our countries, the tremendous \ncontribution the Poles continue to make to this country--and I can tell \nyou, hearing from them on a regular basis as I do, since we have a \nlarge Polish population in our State, that this is something vitally \nimportant to Polish Americans--the ability of family members to come \nfor weddings, funerals, birthdays, et cetera, and not have to wait for \nthe bureaucracy at the American Embassy in Poland to approve these \ntypes of activities.\n  This is an important sign to a good friend that we stand with them \nand that we want to treat them as one of our best friends because, \nindeed, they are one of our best friends in the world. Senator Mikulski \nand I have drafted a piece of legislation that puts Poland into the \nvisa waiver program. I reached out to the Judiciary Committee, which is \nresponsible for this bill. I said: Look, if you have concerns and some \ntweaks we can make that gets them into the program but puts reasonable \nstandards in place, we are happy to consider that. To date, on both \nsides of the aisle, we have not had very much cooperation in making \nwhat I consider to be some minor tweaks that would be necessary to pass \nthis legislation.\n  I have come today to offer this amendment. Hopefully, we can get this \naccepted. If not, I would like to have a vote on this amendment. I \nbelieve it is important for all of us to stand up before our friends in \nPoland and affirm our support for them, as they have affirmed over the \npast many years their support for the United States and the initiatives \nwe have taken around the world.\n  Mr. President, if you look at some of the countries that are in this \nprogram, we have countries such as Brunei in the visa waiver program, \nSan Marino, and Liechtenstein. I suggest that if you are looking at \ncountries that are supportive of the United States, I am not too sure \nyou would name those above Poland. If you name a country whose culture, \nwhose people have close ties to the United States, I am not too sure \nyou would list those countries above Poland.\n  I hope we can consider this amendment and adopt this amendment, \napprove this amendment, and send a very strong signal to our friends in \nPoland that we stand in solidarity with them for their efforts to \ndemocratize, to open markets, and to create the freedom that our \nPresident and so many in the Chamber have advocated over the past \nseveral years.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to continue the fight to \nright a wrong in America's visa program. I believe it's time for \nAmerica to extend the visa waiver program to Poland. I am pleased to \nhave formed a bipartisan partnership with Senator Santorum to introduce \nthis amendment to get it done.\n  In September 2004, Senator Santorum and I met with a hero of the Cold \nWar, Lech Walesa. When he jumped over the wall of the Gdansk Shipyard, \nhe took Poland and the whole world with him. He told us that the visa \nissue is a question of honor for Poland. That day, we introduced a bill \nto once again stand in solidarity with the father of Solidarity by \nextending the visa waiver program to Poland.\n  Last month, I had the honor of meeting with Poland's new President, \nLech Kaczynski, joined by my colleagues Senator Levin and Senator \nLugar. We reaffirmed and cemented the close ties between the Polish and \nAmerican peoples. And we heard loud and clear that the visa waiver \nprogram remains a high priority for Poland.\n  My friends, Poland is not some Communist holdover or third-world \ncountry begging for a handout. The Cold War is over. Poland is a free \nand democratic nation. Poland is a NATO ally and a member of the \nEuropean Union. But America's visa policy still treats Poland as a \nsecond-class citizen. That is just wrong.\n  Poland is a reliable ally, not just by treaty but in deeds. Warsaw \nhosted an international Conference on Combating Terrorism less than 2 \nmonths after the September 11 attacks. Poland continues to modernize \nits armed forces so they can operate with the Armed Forces of the U.S. \nand other NATO allies, buying American F-16s and Shadow UAVs and \nhumvees.\n  More importantly, Polish troops have stood side by side with \nAmerica's Armed Forces. Polish ships participated in Desert Shield and \nDesert Storm during the first gulf war. Poland sent troops to Bosnia as \npart of UNPROFOR and IFOR. Poland sent troops as part of the \ninternational coalition in Afghanistan.\n  Polish troops have been fighting alongside American troops from day 1 \nof the Iraq war. Seventeen Polish soldiers have been killed in Iraq, \nand more than 20 have been injured. They are in Iraq because they want \nto be reliable allies--because they are ready to stand with us even \nwhen the mission is risky and unpopular. Today, nearly 1,000 Polish \ntroops are still on the ground in Iraq, sharing the burden and the risk \nand the casualties. Next year, Poland will send more than 1,000 troops \nto Afghanistan to lead NATO's International Security Assistance Force.\n  So why is France among the 27 countries in the visa waiver program \nbut Poland is not?\n  This amendment will add Poland to the list of designated countries in \nthe visa waiver program. That will allow Polish citizens to travel to \nthe U.S. for tourism or business for up to 60 days\n\n[[Page S2852]]\n\nwithout needing to stand in line to get a visa. That means it will be \neasier for Poles to visit family and friends or do business in America. \nShouldn't we make it easier for the Pulaskis and Kosciuszkos and Marie \nCuries of today to visit our country?\n  We know that our borders will be no less secure because of these \nPolish visitors to our country. But we know that our alliance will be \nmore secure because of this legislation.\n  I urge our colleagues to join us in support of this important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3220\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3220.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To use surveillance technology to protect the borders of the \n                             United States)\n\n       After section 102, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 103. SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Aerial Surveillance Program.--\n       (1) In general.--In conjunction with the border \n     surveillance plan developed under section 5201 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 \n     (Public Law 108-458; 8 U.S.C. 1701 note), the Secretary, not \n     later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     shall develop and implement a program to fully integrate and \n     utilize aerial surveillance technologies, including unmanned \n     aerial vehicles, to enhance the security of the international \n     border between the United States and Canada and the \n     international border between the United States and Mexico. \n     The goal of the program shall be to ensure continuous \n     monitoring of each mile of each such border.\n       (2) Assessment and consultation requirements.--In \n     developing the program under this subsection, the Secretary \n     shall--\n       (A) consider current and proposed aerial surveillance \n     technologies;\n       (B) assess the feasibility and advisability of utilizing \n     such technologies to address border threats, including an \n     assessment of the technologies considered best suited to \n     address respective threats;\n       (C) consult with the Secretary of Defense regarding any \n     technologies or equipment, which the Secretary may deploy \n     along an international border of the United States; and\n       (D) consult with the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration regarding safety, airspace coordination and \n     regulation, and any other issues necessary for implementation \n     of the program.\n       (3) Additional requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--The program developed under this \n     subsection shall include the use of a variety of aerial \n     surveillance technologies in a variety of topographies and \n     areas, including populated and unpopulated areas located on \n     or near an international border of the United States, in \n     order to evaluate, for a range of circumstances--\n       (i) the significance of previous experiences with such \n     technologies in border security or critical infrastructure \n     protection;\n       (ii) the cost and effectiveness of various technologies for \n     border security, including varying levels of technical \n     complexity; and\n       (iii) liability, safety, and privacy concerns relating to \n     the utilization of such technologies for border security.\n       (4) Continued use of aerial surveillance technologies.--The \n     Secretary may continue the operation of aerial surveillance \n     technologies while assessing the effectiveness of the \n     utilization of such technologies.\n       (5) Report to congress.--Not later than 180 days after \n     implementing the program under this subsection, the Secretary \n     shall submit a report to Congress regarding the program \n     developed under this subsection. The Secretary shall include \n     in the report a description of the program together with such \n     recommendations as the Secretary finds appropriate for \n     enhancing the program.\n       (6) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this subsection.\n       (b) Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program.--\n       (1) Requirement for program.--Subject to the availability \n     of appropriations, the Secretary shall establish a program to \n     procure additional unmanned aerial vehicles, cameras, poles, \n     sensors, satellites, radar coverage, and other technologies \n     necessary to achieve operational control of the international \n     borders of the United States and to establish a security \n     perimeter known as a ``virtual fence'' along such \n     international borders to provide a barrier to illegal \n     immigration. Such program shall be known as the Integrated \n     and Automated Surveillance Program.\n       (2) Program components.--The Secretary shall ensure, to the \n     maximum extent feasible, the Integrated and Automated \n     Surveillance Program is carried out in a manner that--\n       (A) the technologies utilized in the Program are integrated \n     and function cohesively in an automated fashion, including \n     the integration of motion sensor alerts and cameras, whereby \n     a sensor alert automatically activates a corresponding camera \n     to pan and tilt in the direction of the triggered sensor;\n       (B) cameras utilized in the Program do not have to be \n     manually operated;\n       (C) such camera views and positions are not fixed;\n       (D) surveillance video taken by such cameras can be viewed \n     at multiple designated communications centers;\n       (E) a standard process is used to collect, catalog, and \n     report intrusion and response data collected under the \n     Program;\n       (F) future remote surveillance technology investments and \n     upgrades for the Program can be integrated with existing \n     systems;\n       (G) performance measures are developed and applied that can \n     evaluate whether the Program is providing desired results and \n     increasing response effectiveness in monitoring and detecting \n     illegal intrusions along the international borders of the \n     United States;\n       (H) plans are developed under the Program to streamline \n     site selection, site validation, and environmental assessment \n     processes to minimize delays of installing surveillance \n     technology infrastructure;\n       (I) standards are developed under the Program to expand the \n     shared use of existing private and governmental structures to \n     install remote surveillance technology infrastructure where \n     possible; and\n       (J) standards are developed under the Program to identify \n     and deploy the use of nonpermanent or mobile surveillance \n     platforms that will increase the Secretary's mobility and \n     ability to identify illegal border intrusions.\n       (3) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     initial implementation of the Integrated and Automated \n     Surveillance Program, the Secretary shall submit to Congress \n     a report regarding the Program. The Secretary shall include \n     in the report a description of the Program together with any \n     recommendation that the Secretary finds appropriate for \n     enhancing the program.\n       (4) Evaluation of contractors.--\n       (A)  Requirement for standards.--The Secretary shall \n     develop appropriate standards to evaluate the performance of \n     any contractor providing goods or services to carry out the \n     Integrated and Automated Surveillance Program.\n       (B) Review by the inspector general.--The Inspector General \n     of the Department shall timely review each new contract \n     related to the Program that has a value of more than \n     $5,000,000, to determine whether such contract fully complies \n     with applicable cost requirements, performance objectives, \n     program milestones, and schedules. The Inspector General \n     shall report the findings of such review to the Secretary in \n     a timely manner. Not later than 30 days after the date the \n     Secretary receives a report of findings from the Inspector \n     General, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and \n     the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives a report of such findings and a description \n     of any the steps that the Secretary has taken or plans to \n     take in response to such findings.\n       (5) Authorization of appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this subsection.\n       Strike section 102(a).\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the sole intent of this \namendment is to take what the committee bill provides in enhancing \nborder security by utilizing technology and enhancing and integrating \nand coordinating that technology, the use of electronic surveillance on \nthe border to augment our border patrol, and the use of unmanned aerial \nvehicles, which are a much cheaper version than the military version, \nbut you can see at night and can also see during all weather--to take \nthat technology and integrate it and coordinate it is the intent of the \namendment.\n  The amendment was born out of an inspector general's report of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, as well as the GAO report on how we \ncan use additional coordination of our technology to enhance our border \nsecurity. It is as simple as that.\n  I am assuming that the chairman of the committee will accept this \namendment because it is just a commonsense amendment. We want to secure \nour borders. There are so many people we can hire; therefore, we ought \nto augment those Border Patrol personnel to secure the borders.\n  Here are a couple of examples. Right now, under electronic \nsurveillance, the signal will go off that somebody has penetrated the \nbarrier. That signal will go to a DHS employee, who then has to \nactivate a camera and search as to where that particular electronic \nsensor has gone off. That is inefficient use of\n\n[[Page S2853]]\n\npersonnel. We have the technology. We can integrate it so that when the \nelectronic sensor goes off--someone has crossed the border--the cameras \nin that particular location can automatically go off and record the \nevent, that event can be sent out to multiple DHS substations, and it \ncan also be sent out into a permanent databank so that we have a \npermanent record of that event. That is one example.\n  Another example is that you have an unmanned aerial vehicle, a drone, \nthat is flying overhead and--same thing--an event is spotted. It is a \ncrossing of the border illegally. Right now, that event is sent back to \npersonnel in DHS.\n  Both the GAO report and the inspector general's report say you ought \nto integrate all that. It ought to likewise--that event--be sent back \nto multiple DHS substations for their immediate response, and it ought \nto go to a permanent databank where it is recorded so that we have this \nvast amount of data. That is the sum and substance of the amendment.\n  I inquire of the Chair, is there a previous order that I was allowed \nto offer just this one amendment, which is No. 3220? I have a second \namendment that is parallel, No. 3221. What did the previous order \nrequire?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is entitled to offer only one amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I see. Well, then, at some point, I will then \nlikewise be offering a second amendment, which is quite similar. I \nexplained a bit about it yesterday.\n  I will simply take this opportunity, while I have the floor, to point \nout what that amendment does, and the committee bill has moved in the \nright direction. The committee bill is providing 20,000 detention beds \nfor people who are picked up for having been illegally in the country. \nWhat happens now is that somebody comes across into America, they are \nhere illegally, and what do you know--we don't have the detention space \nin which to process them. They are released. There is one part of the \nborder where up to 90 percent of the captured illegal aliens are \nreleased after being caught by DHS. Guess what happens. They completely \ndisappear. Only 10 percent, approximately, appear for their subsequent \nimmigration court hearings. DHS says we don't have any space. \nPresently, DHS has in the range of about 10,000 detention bed \nfacilities. So 90 percent of captured aliens are released. The \ncommittee bill clearly is a step in the right direction. What they have \ndone is doubled that to 20,000 beds. What my amendment would do is say \nlet's be realistic: 20,000 beds is not going to cut it, and you are \ngoing to continue on this practice of finding an illegal alien and DHS \nis going to be required then to release them into American society, and \nthey are not going to turn up again. We simply have to stop this.\n\n  My amendment is going to provide an additional 20,000 beds a year for \n5 years or, in other words, to get us to the point after 5 years that \ninstead of having 20,000 detention beds, we will have 100,000 detention \nbeds and be able to meet this problem and stop releasing illegal aliens \nright back into society.\n  At the appropriate point, I will be offering amendment No. 3221.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I believe under the previous order, \nSenators have been allowed to offer amendments as we proceed--not on \nthe immigration bill but on an unrelated bill while the immigration \nbill is pending.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business for 10 \nminutes for the purpose of offering an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the senior Senator from Louisiana's time, the Senator \nfrom Vermont then be recognized to speak on the immigration bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        International Adoptions\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thought it had been cleared to present \nan amendment and discuss it briefly and, at a later time, have a vote \non the amendment. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be submitted for the \nRecord.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator DeMint. Senator Craig is also a cosponsor, and \nseveral other Senators who have been working actually for several years \non this proposal. In fact, my great partner on this bill was the former \nSenator from Oklahoma, Mr. Nickles. Unfortunately, we couldn't get this \nbill through by the time he left. So I know he will be pleased we are \ncontinuing the good work he actually put into place.\n  This is an amendment that I think is going to get great support, \nbroad-based support from both the Republican side and the Democratic \nside. While there are many issues in this bill that are extremely \ncontroversial and very difficult and complicated to work out, which is \nwhy it is taking us a good bit of time and our managers are struggling \nwith it as I speak, this particular piece I think is going to be \nwelcomed with open arms.\n  Actually, the subject of this amendment is for us to welcome children \ninto this country with open arms. These are children who are being \nadopted in ever increasing numbers by American families. The number of \norphans around the world is growing exponentially for many reasons--\nextreme poverty, war, violence, the growing AIDS epidemic--creating a \ntremendous increase in orphans around the world.\n  We are working in many different ways to address that situation, such \nas strengthening child welfare systems within countries of Africa, \nwithin countries such as China and India, as well as strengthening our \nown domestic child welfare system. Many things are underway in \npartnership with our Governors and our local officials to do that right \nhere in America.\n  But the fact remains that despite our best efforts to strengthen \nfamilies, to improve child welfare systems and procedures in our \ncountry and around the world, the number of orphans is growing. The \ngood news, however, is Americans are stepping up in unprecedented \nnumbers to adopt more children out of our foster care children who, \nthrough no fault of their own, have been separated from their birth \nfamilies and some for very good reasons because they have been abused, \nneglected, and have been, unfortunately, in some instances, hideously \ntortured at the hands of people who are supposed to be caring for them.\n  We have increased the opportunities for adoption. This amendment I am \noffering, called the ICARE Act, as an amendment to this bill proposes \nto improve the international adoption process. We have increased \ninternational adoptions from 7,000 children abroad in 1990 to over \n23,000 children by 2004.\n  You may know, Mr. President, of families from Georgia who have \nadopted children from other countries. In fact, Members of the Senate \nhave themselves gone through international adoptions with great success \nand, of course, a great blessing to the receiving family and a great \nblessing to these children whose options were extremely limited to the \ncountries from which they came.\n  This bill that has been thoroughly examined over the last several \nyears by the authorizing committees would afford foreign adopted \nchildren the same automatic citizenship that is granted to a child born \nto an American family overseas. If you are overseas and you have a \nbaby, that baby gets automatic citizenship. This would, at the act of \nadoption in a foreign country, provide that same coverage to children \nwho are adopted.\n  Of course, those of us with adopted children try to explain to \neveryone that once you have adopted children, it is impossible to \ndistinguish between children you have adopted and biological children. \nYou love them the same and they are an immediate part of the family. \nMany of us have experienced that on our own.\n  The amendment would also eliminate much of the redtape and paperwork \nassociated with foreign adoptions, centralize the current staff and \nresources working on international adoption into one office, the Office \nof International Adoption in the State Department, and it would enable \nour State Department\n\n[[Page S2854]]\n\nto provide greater diplomatic representation and proactive advocacy in \nthe area of international adoption.\n  The fact is, in conclusion, since 1965, when these original laws were \nplaced on the books, they have not kept up with either the pace or the \nchange of international adoption, and that is what this amendment seeks \nto do.\n  So on behalf of Senator DeMint, myself, Senator Craig, who serves \nwith me as cochair of the adoption caucus, and others, I offer this \namendment for the Senate to consider. When we get to the time when we \ncan vote on some of these amendments, I hope to reserve some time to \nspeak again about the importance of this amendment and, hopefully, it \ncan be adopted by a voice vote. Hopefully we won't have to have a long \ndebate about this, but if we do, I am prepared to debate this amendment \nfor the thousands and thousands of families in America who, in their \nmind, are doing literally God's work by going to countries and adopting \nchildren who, without this intervention in their life, would literally, \nin many instances, die.\n  For Americans, the least we can do is reduce the redtape, honor their \nextraordinary commitment and their deep financial commitment, as well \nas to bring a child here at great expense and to raise them, and it is \nnot cheap to do that in the United States. We want to honor that work \nAmericans are doing and say we are reducing their paperwork, making \nthings more automatic for them, all the while keeping our safeguards in \nplace for a transparent, cost-effective system of intercountry and \ninternational adoption.\n  That is what my amendment does. Again, I offer it on behalf of myself \nand Senator DeMint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad the senior Senator from Louisiana \nis on the floor. I commend her for her statement. She has been a Senate \nleader on this very important humanitarian matter. We have discussed \nthe question of international adoptions many times. I know how \nwonderful she has been in--I don't mean to embarrass her--not just her \nposition as a Senator, but in her personal life. She has been \nwonderful. She has worked with Republicans, Democrats, and those who \nhave no political affiliation on this issue.\n  I have to think that because of her work there are many children \nthroughout this country who are going to have a life much better than \nthey would have had otherwise. I commend my colleague. I am glad to \nserve with her and I know she wants to bring forward an amendment on \nthis subject. I believe it is No. 3225, which I should also note is a \nbipartisan amendment.\n  I support this amendment, the ICARE Act. I hope we can agree to have \nit formally offered and successfully considered. International adoption \ncries out for this relief. I will work with my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to see if we can get this adopted. I would be \nsurprised if there is any Senator--Republican or Democrat--who would \nobject to it. I certainly will give it my strong support.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we were making some progress yesterday. We \nhad a number of amendments that were adopted--one by the distinguished \nRepublican leader and others. But then some tried to turn this into a \npartisan fight, and I think that is unfortunate. I hope we are back on \ntrack. We heard from a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle \nwho support the bipartisan comprehensive bill, some of whom came down \nto speak for the first time in this debate. Senator Menendez spoke from \nhis unique perspective as one who was a Member of the House during \ntheir debate on their bill. He was there when they debated their \nimmigration bill. It turned out to be a very narrow and punitive bill, \nwhich he opposed. He is now a Member of the Senate and is supporting a \nfar better bill here today.\n  Senator Nelson of Florida described amendments in which he is \ninterested. Senator Lieberman spoke about an amendment which he and \nSenator Brownback wish to offer relating to asylum. Senator Brownback \nand Senator Lieberman have this totally bipartisan amendment to which, \nfor some reason, my Republican colleagues on the other side of the \naisle are objecting. Senator Kerry spoke forcefully and eloquently.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about the comments made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. Salazar. I was struck by his \ndescription of the slurs to which he has been subjected for his support \nof the comprehensive bipartisan committee bill. I talked with Senator \nSalazar, I think it was probably about 9:30 last night. He called me at \nhome and we talked about his experiences. I told him how proud I was of \nhim for standing up. Some of the things that were said were things such \nas: ``Go back to where you came from.'' His family came to North \nAmerica in the 16th century, a lot earlier than either side of my \nfamily. He is justly and rightly proud of his background, his ethnic \nbackground, and the great contributions he and his family have made to \nthis country. I think about how horrible it is that he has to face \nthese kinds of slurs. We are trying to do what is right for all \nAmericans. This is not a situation where we have tried to craft a bill \nfor one group of Americans over others, and Senator Salazar has worked \nto help us accomplish this.\n\n  So these slurs are wrong and it should be unacceptable to all of us. \nSenator Salazar is an outstanding Senator who has made great \ncontributions. He served previously as the attorney general of his \nState. He is thoughtful and genuine, and he approaches issues in a \nserious manner. I am deeply offended that opponents of comprehensive \nimmigration legislation have subjected him to these slurs. Let us \ndebate the issues and stop the name-calling.\n  I think that those of us, many of us, who have been called anti-\nCatholic or anti-Christian or anti-Hispanic or anti-southern or anti-\nwomen or anti-American, have been subjected to these attacks because \nthose who disagree with us find it easier to smear than honestly debate \nthe issues. I find it most unfortunate that a Senator of the quality \nand integrity of Ken Salazar would be subjected to this form of an \nattack. This seems to have become a new and unfortunate way to debate. \nIt is almost like an ethnic or religious McCarthyism we are facing. \nPeople don't want to debate the issue, so they slam somebody and \nsuggest base motives.\n  I remember in another debate when some Republicans disagreed with me, \nthey tagged me as being anti-Catholic and anti-Italian. I thought of \nthe slurs my Italian grandparents faced when they immigrated to this \ncountry, and what my mother faced as a young girl because she spoke a \nlanguage different than others were used to. But I also think of the \npride my Italian relatives felt, here in the United States and in my \ngrandparents' home in Italy, when I became a Member of the Senate. I \ndon't feel I have to prove my bona fides for any of my heritage. My \nfather was proud of his Irish background and my mother was proud of her \nItalian background. They were both proud of their heritage, but they \nwent through a difficult time at a different time in this country.\n  I think of the stories of when my father was a teenager and had to \nsupport his mother and sister because my grandfather died as a \nstonecutter in Vermont. At that time Vermont was a much different \nState. It was not the wonderful, proud State it is today. My father \nfaced signs that said: ``No Irish need apply'' or ``no Catholic need \napply.'' In their time, my grandparents faced similar things. That has \nchanged.\n  I worry about those who are unwilling to debate issues of importance \nto this country, people who won't debate the merits, but simply attack \npeople, as they have Senator Salazar or me with baseless religious or \nethnic claims. It is a form of McCarthyism; it is just intolerance of a \ndifferent nature. This Senate should be above that.\n  Those who have seen this happen, whether they are Democrats or \nRepublicans, should condemn it. They should stand up and condemn it, as \none of the greatest Vermont Senators ever to serve, Ralph Flanders, did \nwhen he supported a resolution of censure of Joseph McCarthy for what \nhe was doing. They were members of the same party, and he condemned \nwhat McCarthy did.\n  President Bush called for a civil debate and I wish his supporters \nwould follow that suggestion. I agree with the\n\n[[Page S2855]]\n\nPresident on this. We should have a civil debate. But I wish somebody, \neven one Republican, would step up and condemn the unfounded attacks \nand disassociate themselves from such poisonous conduct. We have a \nmajor piece of legislation here that will affect all 295 million \nAmericans, and it will affect 11 million people who are here in an \nundocumented status in our great country. Let's talk about that and how \nwe can best solve this difficult situation for the good of our country. \nLet's not impugn the character or the motives of any Senator.\n  During yesterday's debate, we had a procedural discussion that became \nunnecessarily heated. I have been here 32 years. Let's go back to \nhaving a Senate that will debate issues and get away from the polemics \nand the name-calling. During the course of the day yesterday, both the \nDemocratic leader and I suggested, along with members of the staff, \namendments on which we could have votes. Republican and Democratic \namendments alike. I think if we had votes on these amendments, or even \nnow if we had votes on these amendments, which are offered by \nRepublicans and Democrats, some by both, we would have the kind of \nmovement that, in my experience after 32 years, gets legislation \nthrough.\n  We sent an initial list of amendments to the other side that we \nbelieve could be scheduled for debate and votes. There is one by \nSenator Brownback and Senator Lieberman that has been rejected. It \ncould pass with probably 80 votes in this body if it came to a vote. I \ndon't know why we can't vote on that.\n  Some on the other side tried to turn this into a partisan debate. The \nDemocratic leader, Senator McCain, Senator Kennedy, and others have \ntaken a bipartisan approach. Senator Specter and I have worked very \nclosely, along with our staffs, under extraordinarily difficult \nscheduling to get this bill on the floor. What we brought to the floor \nis a bipartisan product, and everybody says, let's have a piece of \nbipartisan legislation. The President of the United States has said \nthat. Most columnists have said that. We say that in our speeches. \nWell, let's do it with our votes. Let's not do it just for the \nrhetoric; let's do it in reality.\n\n  The Democratic leader has filed a petition for cloture that I hope \nwill be successful on comprehensive, realistic, and fair immigration \nreform so we can take action this week. If we don't, let's stay through \nthe weekend and let's get this done. Let's get it done. Stop the \npolemics.\n  Finally, as I have said before, don't let politics in this country \ndegenerate into an ethnic and religious McCarthyism, which is what this \ndebate has become. As a man of faith, I am proud to be a U.S. Senator, \nbut I will make my decisions based on what the facts are before me. I \nam proud of my ethnic background. I am proud of the rich culture it has \nbrought to our family, as I am proud of my wife's background as a \nfirst-generation American and the language skills and the background \nshe brought with her. I am proud of the diversity of my grandchildren. \nBut I make my decisions as a Senator based on one thing: the \nextraordinarily solemn oath I have been privileged to take in this \nChamber six different times. I am mindful of the extraordinary \nprivilege it is to walk on this floor and to have a chance to vote. I \nwill vote my conscience. I will bring to bear my skills and my \nbackground as a prosecutor and a lawyer, as a Vermonter, aided by as \nfine a staff as anyone could have. I will bring that experience to \nthese votes. But I will not be cowed by the obscene and irrational \nname-calling by the other side; nor, as I mentioned earlier, will \nSenator Salazar, who is a man with an extraordinary background, \ntremendous integrity, honor, and abilities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have not yet been able to reach \nagreement on voting on key amendments. We do have some peripheral \namendments we will be offering and voting on. We have no agreement on \nlaying down an amendment, but I believe there is no objection to having \nSenator Kyl speak to an amendment he would like to lay down at a future \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we certainly have no objection to anyone \nspeaking on this bill at any length they feel appropriate. But at this \nstage, we are not going to agree to set aside the pending amendment for \nlaying down other amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I ask the distinguished Democratic \nleader if that applies to laying down an amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I don't see the logic, but if we can move ahead for \nSenator Kyl to discuss an amendment that perhaps one day he will be \nable to lay down and perhaps one day he will be able to vote upon it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3246\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, yesterday I sought to introduce amendment No. \n3246. I will not offer that again right now since the minority has \nindicated it would object to the offering of the amendment, but I will \nat least explain what it is. It is a very straightforward amendment \nthat essentially addresses the future temporary worker program. I am \nnot talking now about what is going to happen to the group of people \nwho are here illegally today. We are talking about people who in the \nfuture might want to come legally from their country to work \ntemporarily in the United States. For that group of people, there \nobviously needs to be a system for verifying their eligibility and for \nensuring that program can work. It is estimated that it would take \nabout 18 months maximum to make sure that all of the things would be in \nplace for that program to work.\n  This amendment simply provides that things that the bill calls for to \nbe in place within that roughly 18-month period of time would actually \nhave to be in place before the temporary worker program commenced. In \nother words, it answers the question that many people ask: If you grant \npeople a right to come to the United States and work here, how can we \nbe sure that you have done all of the other things you have said you \nwould do? In effect, this answers it by saying the temporary worker \nprogram doesn't start until we can certify that those other things were \ndone.\n  All of us have talked about the need to ensure that we have enough \ndetention spaces for people who came here illegally and need to be \ndetained; that we have enough Border Patrol agents; that we have enough \nappropriation for some of the other things the bill calls for--and we \nare talking about the underlying bill. Given the fact that we all seem \nto agree that those things need to be done, what this amendment does is \nanswer the question, How do we know they will be done? One way we know \nthey will be done is the temporary worker program doesn't kick in until \nthey are done.\n  We are not talking about in toto, we are only talking about 18 \nmonths' worth of the program. For example, we know that the number of \npeople within the Department of Homeland Security who will be required \nto investigate compliance with immigration laws related to the hiring \nof aliens needs to be increased by 2,000, and those people would need \nto have been employed. We know the number of Border Patrol agents \nwithin the Department would be increased by not less than 2,500 more \nthan on the date of enactment. That is approximately 1 year's worth of \nincrease in Border Patrol agents. In addition, detention spaces I \nmentioned would have to be increased to a level of not less than 2,000 \nmore than the number of beds available on the date of enactment. That \nis about the number that would be created in 1 year's worth of activity \nunder the bill.\n  The point is, we say there are certain things we have promised would \nbe done. In order to make sure that promise is kept and to answer that \nquestion of the American people who say: How do we know, since the law \nhasn't been enforced in the past, that you are going to enforce the new \none, one way we can demonstrate that is to say that the temporary \nworker program under the new law doesn't kick in until these certain \nobjectives have been satisfied.\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\n  They are not unreasonable. They are what is already called for in the \nbill. If we mean what we say in the legislation, then this amendment \nshould not be a difficult amendment to adopt.\n  I reiterate that this applies to what some on the staff have called \nfuture flow workers. It does not apply to the people who are here \nillegally today. There is a separate temporary worker program for those \npeople. But for future flow, in order to make sure that program will \nwork, we have to have certain things in place. This bill would require \nthat some of the things that we have promised would occur within that \nyear's period of time would, in fact, have to be in place before this \nnew temporary worker program would kick in. As I say, when we get an \nopportunity to offer that amendment--it is amendment No. 3240--I hope \nit will be adopted.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3206\n\n  Let me also speak to an amendment that is pending. It is the pending \nbusiness, but we haven't been able to get a vote on it. The number on \nthat amendment is No. 3206.\n  What this amendment implies is that people in certain categories \nwould not be able to participate in the program, and those categories \nare primarily people who are criminals or people who are absconders. By \n``criminals,'' we mean people who have been convicted of a felony or \nthree misdemeanors.\n  The current law provides that if you have been convicted of a crime \nof moral turpitude or a drug-related crime or five multiple offenses \nthat amount to 5 years in prison, you cannot participate in the \nprogram. That is fine, but it leaves out a lot of other crimes. I read \nthe list of crimes yesterday that would not be covered under the \nexisting bill.\n  What this amendment says is, if you have ever committed one of these \nother crimes or if, instead, you have committed one of these other \ncrimes, then the program would not be available to you, either. Let me \nnote what a couple of those other crimes would be. Crimes which are not \ncovered under the current bill but which would be included in this \namendment include burglary, involuntary manslaughter, loan-sharking, \nassault and battery, possession of an unregistered sawed-off shotgun, \nriot, kidnapping, making a false statement to a U.S. agency----\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Yes, I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator help me understand his amendment? As I \nunderstand it, he has spent a great deal of time explaining crimes that \nwould be included which would disqualify a person from the possibility \nof legalization, but he has not spent time discussing what I think is \nthe more troublesome aspect of his amendment, which would say that if a \nperson overstays a visa, he or she would be ineligible for \nlegalization.\n  If I could concede to the Senator from Arizona that, if he is going \nto add the crimes he has mentioned--I happen to think they are \ncurrently covered by the bill before us, but if there is need for some \nclarification in that regard, I think we could work on it--but would \nthe Senator be kind enough to address that basic issue? Are you saying \nif a person, currently on a student visa, is failing a class, drops the \nclass, no longer is a full-time student and is therefore out of \ncompliance with the student visa, that person by virtue of dropping \nthat class has now disqualified himself from legalization under the \nbill that is before us?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from Illinois asked the \nquestion. That was the second point I was going to get to. The first \nhad to do with crimes, but I will be happy to leave that conversation \nand move to the absconders, as I said. ``Absconders'' is the word that \nis used to describe those people who have been ordered by a judge to \nleave the country because of something they have done--more than simply \noverstaying a visa--and have refused to do that. In other words, they \nhave already demonstrated an unwillingness to comply with an order to \nleave the country.\n  Obviously, part of the enforcement of all of this legislation depends \nupon our ability to enforce the law for people who are unwilling to \ncomply with the law's terms. If someone has already demonstrated an \nunwillingness do that, it seems to me they should not be eligible. And \nlet me go on to say that the suggestion that a simple visa overstayer \nis caught up in this is not true--not true.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Why don't I explain it, and then the Senator from Illinois \nwon't have to keep asking questions about what it actually does.\n  There are four different sections. One of them has to do with the \nremoval of people where there has been a formal proceeding and the \nalien has been detained. That is section 238. There are probably about \n20,000--well, probably more than that, but there is at least a minimum \nof 20,000 because many of those are other than Mexicans. We do not have \nthe number for people, for example, who would be Mexican citizens.\n  There are also formal proceedings before an immigration judge. This \nnumber of absconders is far greater. That is section 240. There are a \nlot more in that category, perhaps 200,000 to 300,000 people.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask a question?\n  Mr. KYL. Let me finish the discussion so the Senator will not have to \ninterrupt and ask questions, please.\n  Third, there are the situations where you have visa waiver countries \nwhere, because of the terms of the visa waiver, there has been a \nprewaiver of a right to contest removal, so there is no formal \nproceeding. There are about 900 removed under that provision per year. \nSo this is not just visa overstayers. There are millions of visa \noverstayers, obviously. And finally the category of expedited removal, \nwhich is section 235, where an alien is detained until deportation. We \ndon't have data on how many were deported but are still in the United \nStates.\n  These are categories of people where it is not simply violating it--\nit is not coming into the United States illegally that triggers a visa \noverstayer. In fact, I am not sure we wrote this broadly enough because \na visa overstayer such as Mohamed Atta--somebody from a country that \ndoes not have a visa waiver, from a country such as Saudi Arabia--would \nnot be caught. So here is Mohamed Atta who overstays his visa, flies an \nairplane into the World Trade Center, and he would not, even under the \namendment we have provided here, be precluded from participating in the \nprogram.\n  What I am saying is I don't think we drafted this quite broadly \nenough, but it makes the point that merely overstaying the visa does \nnot catch you up in this particular bill. So it is wrong to say all we \nhave to do is overstay a visa and this amendment would catch you up. \nThat is simply not the case. The number probably caught up in this \nwould be in the neighborhood of 300,000.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, here is what I understand the law to be \nand what your amendment says. The law, as I understand it, is if you \nare in the United States on a student visa from a foreign country, you \nare required to be a full-time student and to stay. If you are failing \na course, you drop out of the course, you are no longer a full-time \nstudent and, therefore, you are ineligible to stay on a student visa. \nAt that point, you are subject to a final order of removal which means \nyou can be deported from this country, having a presence in this \ncountry that is not recognized by your student visa because you dropped \nthe course.\n  Now let me read what your amendment says. It says:\n\n       An alien is ineligible for conditional nonimmigrant work \n     authorization and status under this section if the alien is \n     subject to a final order of removal.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Keep reading.\n  Mr. DURBIN. ``Under sections 217, 235, 238, and 240.''\n  My question to you is this----\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time. The reason I said \n``keep reading'' is because I just read to you under each of those \nsections, 217, 235, 238, and 240, the specific circumstances under \nwhich someone would be precluded from participating in the benefits of \nthe bill. It is not, with due respect, as the Senator from Illinois \nsaid, overstaying a visa. You have to have been subject to one of these \nfour specific sections.\n  As I said, the first one is a visa waiver. There were 900 people last \nyear who were removed under that. It wouldn't\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\neven include a person such as Mohamed Atta, as I said.\n  I need to go back and try to fix the amendment with regard to that. \nSections 235 and 238 are the expedited removal of aggravated felons and \nI am sure the Senator doesn't want to allow those people to remain. \nSection 240 is where there has been a formal appearance before an \nimmigration judge and a person has specifically been ordered to depart \nand has not done so.\n  It is simply wrong to say if you come across the border and stay \nhere, or if you overstay your visa, you are caught up in my amendment. \nMy amendment is much more specific than that and specifically only \ndeals with those people you would not want the benefits to apply to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might further ask a question without \nasking the Senator to surrender the floor, of course, let me ask this \nquestion: What you said and the last thing you mentioned was if you \nwere in the United States and had an order issued that you will leave, \ndepart, but the language of your amendment doesn't say that. The \nlanguage says you are subject to a final order, which means you could \nbe--you could be--subject to a final order. You are not saying a final \norder has been issued for deportation, and, therefore, you are \nineligible. You are saying you are sure. If I have overstayed my visa, \nsadly, I am subject to an order of deportation, even if it has not been \nentered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me answer the question again by saying I \nknow my colleague is a good lawyer, but you have to read the whole \nsentence. You can't read half of a sentence and drop off the last part \nof the sentence. It specifically says under section 217, 235, 238, or \n240. It is not simply subject to a final order of removal. It is \nsubject to a final order of removal under one of those four sections.\n  The last section the Senator referred to is section 240. That is \nwhere there has already been a formal proceeding before an immigration \njudge, an order of removal has been issued, and it has been violated. \nYes, the person is subject to a final order of removal because that \nperson has already violated the judge's order.\n  As to each of these sections, as I said, there is a specific reason \nwhy it is included and why it isn't merely subject to a final order of \nremoval.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might further ask a question, if the \nSenator from Arizona wants to make it clear that overstays on visas do \nnot disqualify you from the pathway to legalization unless a final \norder has been entered saying you must be deported, I wish the Senator \nwould clarify that language. As it stands, you have said if you are \nsubject to--meaning you could be charged with--having overstayed your \nvisa, you could be deported then you are disqualified. I think if you \nwould clarify and tighten the language, it would overcome some of the \nserious concerns we have. The example the Senator used in other cases \nof terrorists and people we clearly don't want in the United States, I \ndon't think you will have much, if any, argument. But when it comes to \nthis particular circumstance, I think the language is subject to an \ninterpretation you may not want.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate the suggestion of the Senator from Illinois. It \nis a usual legislative drafting tradition to say what you mean by \nreferring to other sections of law and only those sections of law that \nyou intend to cover. That is what we have done here. We have not \nreferred to sections of law that would refer broadly to anyone who has \noverstayed a visa.\n  Let me reiterate. The Senator asked about the court proceeding. That \nwas the section 240 I referred to. That is specifically where there has \nbeen a proceeding. The others I mentioned I will reiterate again.\n  The visa waiver: As the Senator knows, there are 27 countries where \nwe have a relationship with a visa waiver. What that means is the \nindividual, upon entering the United States, waives rights somebody \nunder section 240 would not have waived because they do not even have \nto present a visa to the United States. They, in effect, agree as they \ncome in, as a condition to the use of that provision, to be removable \nfor violation of their visa.\n  As I said, last year, according to our information, a grand total of \n900 people were removed under that particular provision.\n  This is not something on which we round people up and send them home. \nThe expedited removal, sections 235 and 238--as I said, 238 is the \nremoval of aggravated felons--and expedited removal under the provision \nthe Department of Homeland Security has now established for other than \nMexicans who come to the United States, for whom there is no detention \nspace and who are being removed from the United States, are subject to \nthis as well.\n  To talk about what this problem is and why we are trying to solve it, \nyou have 39,000 Chinese citizens in the United States illegally whom \nthe Chinese Government won't take back. There are similar numbers of \npeople from other countries, although I do not know of any quite that \nlarge.\n  It is not a simple matter with people from countries such as this to \ntake them to the Mexican border and turn them over to Mexico which \nobviously won't take them. They are not Mexican citizens. We don't have \nthe detention space right now to accommodate about 165,000 other-than-\nMexican illegal immigrants. The Department of Homeland Security has \nannounced their streamlined procedure of expedited removal where it \ntries to get the country to take the individual back within a period of \nless than 4 weeks. They are trying to get it down to a couple of weeks.\n  But as I said, many countries won't take them back. What happens is \nyou end up with people we don't have a place to put. There is no \ndetention space available. They are given an order to appear before the \ncourt in 90 days. Basically, they are released on their own \nrecognizance and asked to come back in 90 days to the Department of \nHomeland Security and show up for their removal. They do not do so. \nThere is no place to put them. They do not show up for removal, and \nthey meld into our society.\n  I doubt the Senator from Illinois is saying these--I believe it was \nabout 165,000 such people last year--are people we should put on a path \nto citizenship.\n  Those are the four categories of people we are talking about: \naggravated felons, people who have already violated a court order, \nexpedited removal, and a small number of visa waiver people.\n  It does not apply to you simply if you overstayed your visa or if you \ncame into the country illegally and, therefore, violated our law that \nsays you are to present yourself at a port of entry. They violated that \nlaw. But merely coming into the country illegally is not covered by \nthis amendment.\n  So the roughly 12 million people, or however many we are talking \nabout here, would not be covered by this; at most, perhaps, in the \nneighborhood of 300,000.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, \nI understand the Senator's explanation, and I have to go back to a \npoint that I think if he would clarify his language in his amendment, \nit would allay some of the fears we have.\n  Let me give an example of why we are concerned. In the original \nCornyn-Kyl bill that was introduced, it was a question about the \nineligibility of aliens, or deferred mandatory departure, or a similar \ncircumstance where they would not be recognized and given this \nopportunity. Your language in that instance said it would be an alien \nwho would be ``ordered, excluded, deported, removed or to depart \nvoluntarily from the United States.''\n\n  There was specificity there. The decision had been made. I think that \nis a lot clearer and more consistent with the explanation you have \ngiven us than the words ``subject to a final order'' which I think is \nmuch more general in scope and perhaps too broad, maybe leading to my \nconclusion that may not be consistent with your intent.\n  I ask you if you would consider tightening your language here as you \ndid in the original bill with Senator Cornyn so we know exactly what we \nare dealing with.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the suggestion. I would be happy \nto visit with the Senator from Illinois who, as I said before, is a \ngood lawyer and who understands the details of this to make sure we are \ndenying the privileges of the underlying legislation only to those \npeople whom we intend to deny those privileges to. I think we\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\nhave a rough meeting of the mind as to who those people are.\n  I will say, however, it does get difficult because when the Senator \nfrom Illinois says, for example, we don't just want visa overstayers to \nbe caught up in this, as a general proposition, I agree with that.\n  What that means is, of course, Mohamed Atta and many of his cohorts \nwould not have been denied the benefits of this legislation because \nthey simply overstayed a visa.\n  The point here is it is hard to draw these distinctions and deny the \nprivileges to people you don't want to get them and yet not sweep too \nbroad a broom and preclude people you have no intention of denying the \nbenefits to from participating in those benefits.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield again for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. KYL. I would be happy to yield again.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, please let us not wave the bloody shirt of \nMohamed Atta. He would be disqualified from this program under existing \nlaw. Terrorists are not going to be given a legal pathway to \ncitizenship in America. No one wants that to happen, none of us. So I \ndon't think that was a good example of why we need the Kyl amendment.\n  Wouldn't you agree that in language already in the bill before the \nSenate, Mohamed Atta wouldn't have a prayer if he said, I want to stick \naround; I know I have been convicted as a terrorist, but I want to be \nan American citizen?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with all due respect, I think that question \nwas pretty far off the mark. Mohamed Atta committed his crime before he \ncould have been convicted of being a terrorist, and he obviously killed \nhimself in the process. The time to apply this legislation to him is \nnot after the fact but hopefully before the fact.\n  The problem is that at the time he overstayed his visa, to our \nknowledge, he had not committed any other crime except perhaps forging \nsome documents or making false statements to an immigration official--\nsomething such as that.\n  What I am saying is we have drafted this in a way that it would not \nhave caught people such as Mohamed Atta because to do that would be to \nexclude others from the benefits of the legislation both the Senator \nand I agree should not be excluded.\n  I am simply trying to say we have to be careful with the language \nbecause if we simply say--and I know the Senator from Illinois would \nagree with this proposition when he says we don't want to exclude just \npeople who have overstayed their visas, and he gave the example of the \nstudent who overstayed a visa--I know he doesn't mean to include within \nthat somebody such as Mohamed Atta because the reality is that is \nexactly what we have done here. If we could find some other way to add \na provision that says if we have evidence to believe somebody is a \nterrorist, they would also be included, that probably would be a good \nidea, and we would both agree to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The bill explicitly says if you want to move toward \nlegalization, you have to submit yourself to a criminal background \ncheck; no criminal record. Frankly, I can't imagine there would be a \nterrorist who would say, I will wait patiently for 11 years, and I will \nsubmit to a criminal background check so that in the 12th year I will \ncommit an act of terrorism.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, it may well be that Mohammed Atta may not \nwant to take advantage of the provisions of the act. That is \nspeculation. Although these terrorists did take advantage of our \nimmigration laws in many respects, we did not expect them to do that. \nWe thought they would sneak into the country. Instead they filled out \nthe forms and came in, many of them, with legal visas. I am not sure we \ncan assume what he will do or what he will not do.\n  Here is the point: Under the bill as drafted, only crimes relating to \ndrug offenses, moral turpitude, and the conviction of five offenses \ntotaling 5 years in prison would exclude someone from the benefits. \nThat is why we have added the other elements which, by the way, I \ninform my colleague from Illinois, the conviction of a felony and three \nmisdemeanors, are precisely the language from the 1986 bill.\n  Those who think the 1996 act was unworkable and amnesty and not a \ngood idea should be aware that all we are doing with respect to the \ncriminal violations is taking that same language and putting it into \nthis bill.\n  We have had a good discussion of this amendment. I am happy to see if \nthere is any way to further clarify the language that might get the \nSenator from Illinois to support the amendment. I want to get a vote on \nit.\n  As I said before, I want also to be able to lay down the previous \namendment which simply provides a trigger that before the temporary \nworker program kicks in, certain things we promised to do under the \nbill would have been done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there has been an agreement to take up a \nnumber of noncontroversial amendments. We are still trying to get a \nvote on the Kyl-Cornyn amendment, still trying to work out a procedure \nso Members on both sides of the aisle may offer controversial \namendments, but we have not gotten there yet. However, there has been \nagreement on four noncontroversial amendments. I give notice that we \nwill take them up as soon as the authors can come over.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the chairman of the Judiciary Committee tell us what \nthose four amendments are?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would. And before we can do it, we have to have \nconsent to set aside pending amendments.\n  Mr. KYL. Because I advise you in advance I will object to setting \naside pending amendments for consideration of further amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The ones agreed to are these, and we cannot proceed \nuntil the pending amendment is set aside: Mikulski-Warner, 3217; \nCollins, 3211; Dorgan-Burns, 3223; and Isakson, 3203. But we cannot \ntake them up, as noted, unless we have consent to set aside a pending \namendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I note that under the regular order, my \namendment is the first in line, having been offered on Thursday. These \nare subsequent amendments. It seems to me our colleagues would be \nwilling to take up these amendments in the order they were offered.\n  What is curious to me is why some amendments are more worthy than \nothers to be voted on. Maybe it is that people don't want to vote on \ncertain amendments because they are troublesome. But if the object here \nis to try to get this bill completed, then we have to agree on some \nfundamentals, and that is that all the amendments that have been \noffered ought to be voted on. It is logical they would be voted on in \nthe order they were laid down. There is no reason anyone can give me \nwhy there shouldn't be a vote on the amendment I laid down and that \nthat should not precede the other amendments. I consider mine at least \nas worthy as the other amendments, particularly because it goes \ndirectly to a point in the underlying bill, and to my knowledge, the \nother amendments, by and large, do not do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let us understand where we are at this \nmoment. In the colloquy with Senator Kyl, I raised an element of his \namendment which we, I think, generally agreed needs to be clarified. I \nhope we can work toward clarification.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, has asked whether we can now take up amendments which both \nsides agree would be constructive, moving us toward our goal of final \npassage, on a bipartisan basis, asking the Senator from Arizona, would \nyou please set your amendment aside, perhaps to work on the subject of \nyour colloquy a few moments ago, and then you will be back in the \nqueue.\n  We are not only prepared, incidentally, on the Democratic side to \nentertain the four amendments which have been spelled out by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, we are also prepared to debate and vote on \nat least three other amendments, the Lieberman-Brownback asylum, an \nAllard amendment 3213, and a Nelson amendment 3220.\n  So the argument among some that we are stopping the amendment process \nis not true. At this point, the Senator from Arizona is stopping the \namendment process because his amendment, which is not quite in the \nshape it\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nmight be in, or wants to be in, is going to be first or nothing else. I \nhope that is not where we are going to end this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. With all due respect, I think that is a bit of spin to say I \nam stopping the amendment process. On Thursday, Friday, Monday, and \nTuesday, I asked unanimous consent to proceed to amendments. Democrats \nobjected. The amendment following mine is the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Georgia. That is not on the list, either.\n  What is happening is that the Democratic side wants to vote on \ncertain amendments--most of which do not go to the heart of the bill--\nand does not want to vote on other amendments.\n\n  What we are saying is, we have a right to lay down amendments and \nvote on those amendments. I am happy to vote on every single amendment \nthat has been laid down. But Members on the other side will not give me \nan opportunity to lay down another amendment. I have asked for that \nrepeatedly. Unanimous consent has been denied. I asked the \ndistinguished minority leader this morning. He said no, there would not \nbe consent for me to even lay down the amendment I just got through \ntalking about.\n  So let's understand that the objections to moving forward are not on \nthis side. They are on the other side. I simply ask for the regular \norder.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If there is no objection on the other side, I renew that \nunanimous consent that we move immediately to consideration of \nMikulski-Warner, 3217; Collins, 3211; Dorgan, 3223; Isakson, 3203, with \n2 minutes of debate evenly divided before each vote, and that we start \ntaking those up immediately. I ask unanimous consent to move forward.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, I offer an amendment to that \nunanimous consent request which is that those amendments occur as \nidentified but to be preceded by a vote on amendments that are in the \nregular order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, we are back where we \nstarted. Senator Kyl will not let a single amendment be considered \nunless he is first. We have a bipartisan agreement to move to four and \nperhaps three other worthy amendments while he works on the language of \nhis, which is not acceptable. We have reached an impasse, and I object \nto his modification of my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, without being repetitious, although \nrepetition is only a minor vice here since nothing of consequence is \nlikely to be said in any event. Moving this bill along, Senator Kyl has \naccurately articulated the situation. We are being prevented from \nvoting on amendments which have priority in sequence, where we ought to \nbe voting, and it is just make-work to take up other amendments. It \nwould occupy some time and we would have fewer quorum calls, but it \ndoes not move toward the heart of the issue. Senator Kyl ought to be \naccorded the opportunity to vote on his amendment. The rules have \nbrought us to an absolute impasse again. So then we have another day \nwasted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I will take a minute. On Thursday of last \nweek, I offered in this Senate amendment 3215 which is pending after \nthe amendment by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, the Senator \nfrom Texas. On Friday, when the majority of the Senate went home and \nthere were no votes, I stayed in this Senate for 3 hours and presided \nin order for Senator Bingaman and Senator Alexander to offer their \namendments. We had last week a spirit of cooperation in this Senate to \nensure that suggestions and amendments of the Members would be dealt \nwith as expeditiously as possible. The Senate stayed in session on \nFriday to accommodate Democrats and Republicans alike with the \nunderstanding we would proceed in regular order this week.\n  To blame the Senator from Arizona for being obstructionist is totally \nincorrect. The fact is, there are other amendments following his that \nwould equally be objected to by the distinguished minority whip. So we \nare frozen at this time because there is a lack of spirit of \ncooperation in order to consider issues that are important to the \npeople of the United States of America on what I consider to be the \nmost important domestic issue in the United States of America.\n  So singular blame on any one individual such as Mr. Kyl is not only \ninappropriate, it is not right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I become very frustrated when it is evident \nthat nobody wants to do what is the will of the Senate. It is a \nhistoric responsibility when you bring a piece of legislation to the \nSenate, which is to allow Senators, Democrat and Republican, to work \ntheir will with offering amendments that are, hopefully, germane and \nresponsible to be debated and voted on.\n  Why would I want any amendments? I have all I want in the bill. The \nJudiciary Committee included agricultural jobs, a guest worker revised \nprogram, and a program that will deal with illegal undocumented workers \nalready in country that relate to agriculture in the bill.\n  Would I want anymore amendments? In fact, the Senator from Georgia \nhas already offered an amendment against me. One of my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle has openly said he wants to kill the AgJOBS \nprovision in this bill, and he has a multiple of amendments he wants to \noffer. I am willing to let him offer them. I am willing to debate him. \nI think I can defeat him. I hope I have the prevailing argument.\n  But what is at hand here is a very important piece of work done by \nthe Judiciary Committee, S. 2454. I am not going to suggest it is \nperfect in every way. The amendment process does refine and direct the \nwill of the total Senate instead of the will of a single committee.\n  I suspect the chairman of the Judiciary Committee would be hard \npressed to say this bill is flawless, it is perfect, it is without \nreproach. That is not what my phone calls are saying. That is not what \nthe public is saying. In fact, the public in many instances disagrees \nwith the provisions I have put in the bill.\n  What is important is exactly what the other Senator, Senator Isakson, \nsaid. This is one of our major domestic issues. It is an issue of \nnational security. It is an issue of border control. It is an issue of \nrecognizing the diverse economies of our country and the need for an \nemployment base that is legal, documented, and controlled. It is a \nmatter of immigration.\n  To suggest we are going to play games with who is on first and who is \non second about who makes an amendment, who offers an amendment--why is \nthe other side so nervous and frightened that somehow this bill might \nbe changed a little bit? Better or worse, I don't know.\n  I think all who have spent time on this issue and know the issue are \ncertainly willing to debate it or we wouldn't be with the issue. We \nwould simply be running politically away from it as this Congress has \ndone for a good number of years.\n  But the American people, in frustration, in anger, in fear, are now \nsaying deal with it, control your border, our border, our Nation's \nborder. Define and prescribe, background check, inspect those who cross \nit, at the same time, recognize that a certain type of employee is \ncritically necessary in American agriculture to do the tough, hard, \nbackbreaking work in the fields of America or to change the beds in our \nresorts or to work in certain forms of manufacturing or in oil patch.\n\n  Now, that is at that level of work, and that is an entry-level job, \nand it is critical to our economy that we have them. Americans, on the \nlarge part, have chosen not to do that kind of work anymore. But I \nrecognize the need to recognize American citizens who do, and in my \nAgJOBS reform of the H-2A program, we create a national labor pool and \nrecognize, first, if someone who is an American citizen is seeking that \nkind of employment, we make sure they are eligible and eligible first. \nIt is Americans first in this instance, as it should be.\n  At the same time, there must be a clear recognition that there are \nnow millions in this country, yes, here illegally, but all of them \nworking, and working hard, and paying taxes, and not getting the \nbenefit of those. Why?\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nNaturally, they are not citizens. We understand that. They probably \nought to go home when they are through working, and 90 percent of them \nwant to go home. But the irony is, as we continue to control our \nborder, we create an impenetrable line, as we should, and those who \nhave moved back and forth across that border historically no longer can \ndo that.\n  Well, it is an interesting thing. It is an interesting issue. The \nHouse tried to deal with it in one way--I do not think appropriately, I \ndo not think responsibly. I am not suggesting it is not responsible to \ncontrol the border. We are doing that in this bill. But I believe we \nare doing it in a much more sensitive and humane way.\n  The border has to be secured or what we do here will not work. You \ncannot try to control and identify and direct employment traffic, if \nyou will, in this country if you cannot control the flow of the \ntraffic. That is part of what we are all about in trying to deal with \nthis issue.\n  There are those who would say: Round them up and throw them out--\nround up 8 million, round up five times the size of the population of \nthe State of Idaho and somehow identify them and treat them as legally \nas you have to under the law and get them out? We cannot do that, will \nnot do that. It is impractical to do that. That is what this bill has \nstruggled to accomplish.\n  But let's stop and suggest that if this is the issue we all believe \nit is, why are we fearful of amendments? Why has the other side \nsleepwalked us for the last 2 days? We ought to have voted on 3, 5, 8, \n10 amendments by now. What are we fearful of?\n  I have my provision in the bill, but let Senator Chambliss amend it. \nLet him try. Let us debate it. Let us see the differences between what \nhe believes and what I believe. We both agree on so many things as it \nrelates to the agricultural employment base, but we disagree on some \nthings. There is nothing wrong with that kind of healthy debate. I do \nnot fear it. I will not fear it.\n  And I must say to my colleague from Illinois, when you tried to make \nthe straw person the Senator from Arizona, there is an expression south \nof the Mason-Dixon line that is simply said: That dog don't hunt. Find \na new straw person. This one does not work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, and so the Senator from Idaho says we \nought to have considered three, five, eight amendments by now. Well, he \nsuggests we are sleepwalking. Perhaps he was sleepwalking when we \nconsidered three amendments, the first by Senator Frist, the Republican \nmajority leader, the second by Senator Bingaman, the third by Senator \nAlexander. And the fourth was a motion by the Senator from Pennsylvania \nto table the Kyl amendment. It is not as if we have not been \nconsidering amendments. If I am not mistaken, moments ago I suggested, \nlet's move to four right now, and maybe seven. So let's move forward on \nthese amendments.\n  So to suggest we are not moving through the amendment process is not \naccurate. To suggest we are sleepwalking--if you were wide awake, you \nwould be aware of the fact that we voted on three amendments already on \nthis bill and others were just denied an opportunity to be called just \nmoments ago on the floor by the Senator from Arizona.\n  It appears now that those who oppose this bill or those who want to \nslow it down are intent on making the Kyl amendment the way to do it. I \nwould say that Senator Kyl and I had a colloquy just a few moments ago \non the floor, and it was very clear to me that his language in the \namendment needs to be changed so that it is clear to everyone what he \nintends to achieve.\n  I thought that is where he was going. I thought that is what he \nacknowledged. But having even acknowledged that, he will not allow \nanother amendment to come forward while his is still pending on the \nfloor. That is unfortunate.\n  It was said earlier that----\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. You are really going to suggest that the last 2 days of \neffort are called heavy lifting? Shouldn't we redefine what work in \nthis body is all about?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say in response, I do not believe I used that \nterm.\n  Mr. CRAIG. You did not use that term; I just did. But you have \nsuggested we have been at great industry here over the last 2 days?\n  Mr. DURBIN. No. I can tell you--reclaiming my time, I would say to \nthe Senator from Idaho, most of the work that has been going on has \nbeen off the floor in the Republican caucus because the Republican \nmajority has to decide whether we are going to have a comprehensive \nimmigration bill. There are 55 votes on their side of the aisle, 45 \nvotes on our side of the aisle.\n  We are standing firm in the belief that the bipartisan bill which \nemerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the support of the \nRepublican chairman, Senator Specter, is the good starting point for us \nto really address comprehensive immigration reform, for the first time \nin decades.\n  The heavy lifting has been off the floor while the party of the \nSenator from Idaho has been trying to decide their place in history. \nWill they be part of a comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform or \nstand in its path? They have to make that decision. We cannot make it \non the floor for them. The sooner they make it, the better.\n  Last night, the Democratic leader, Senator Reid, filed a cloture \nmotion to make it clear there will be a moment of reckoning. Here on \nthe Senate floor, in very short order, the Republicans and Democrats \nwill face a basic choice: Do we stop, do we kill this bill, this \nbipartisan comprehensive immigration bill or do we move forward? I hope \nwe move forward because I think this is a good bill.\n  When I listened to the Senator from Idaho talk about enforcement, \nwell, let me say, the enforcement provisions of the bill before us are \namazing. And I use that term advisedly. But they are amazing.\n  We increase the number of Border Patrol agents over the next 5 years \nby 12,000--12,000. Currently, there are about 2,000. Think about that. \nWhat a dramatic increase in making our borders safer.\n  We increase the number of interior agents going after those who \nshould not be in this country by 5,000 over the next 5 years.\n  Agents dedicated to combating alien smuggling, up 1,000 over the next \n5 years.\n  We also require the Department of Homeland Security to construct at \nleast 200 miles of vehicle barriers at all-weather roads in areas known \nas transit points for illegal crossings. This is in the bill before us.\n  We understand, as most would concede, that America's borders are out \nof control. They are broken down. Part of any comprehensive immigration \npackage must have strong enforcement. The bipartisan bill before us \ndoes exactly that.\n  It goes on to require primary fencing in areas where we think it is \nnecessary to stop illegal crossings. There are technology enhancements, \nreplacing existing fencing, constructing vehicle barriers in certain \nArizona population centers. The list goes on and on. Criminalization--\ngreater penalties for those crossing the border illegally.\n  All of these things indicate this is not just a bill dealing with \nlegalization, it is a bill dealing with enforcement. We took the \nprovisions which Senator Frist, the Republican leader, offered and we \nduplicated them. So to argue the bill before us is weak on enforcement \ndoes not stand up. It is strong on enforcement.\n  But let me be clear. Our lesson is this: Simply increasing \nenforcement will not solve the immigration problems of America. We have \n2,000 border agents now. We have increased them over the years. We have \ndone a lot over the last 4 or 5 years, and illegal immigration has \ncontinued. You need to do more.\n  In addition to border enforcement, you have to do two things. You \nhave to deal with the employment. What is the magnet that draws people \nacross that border into the United States? It is the prospect of a job, \na job that will pay much more than they can make in their villages in \nMexico, in Central America, or in Poland or Ireland, for that matter.\n  What we do is say that the employers who illegally hire people and \nexploit\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\nthem are going to be held accountable. There are tough penalties under \nthe law. So border enforcement is tough. Employer enforcement is tough, \nas it should be.\n  But there is a third element. The third element gets to the heart of \nthe issue. What are we going to do about 11 or 12 million people \ncurrently in the United States who are not documented? If you listen to \nsome of the cable show hosts, they say: Send them home. Deport 12 \nmillion people. That is totally unrealistic. Physically, it could not \nbe achieved. If it could be, it would be an expense far greater than \nanyone could imagine for this country.\n\n  What we have to do is have realistic, tough, fair answers. Here is \nwhat we have come up with. If you are here, having overstayed a visa, \nor without documentation, in the United States, we will give you a \nchance, a chance to become legal. But it is a long, hard road. It will \ntake you 11 years--11 years--of your life. You better be committed to \nbeing part of America's future--11 years.\n  In the course of that 11 years, it is not going to be easy. If you \nbreak the law, you are out. If you are not working, demonstrating \nemployment, caring for your family, you cannot qualify. If you do not \npass a criminal background check, you are out. If you do not pay a fine \nof several thousand dollars, you are out. If you have not learned \nEnglish, you are out. If you have not paid your back taxes, you are \nout. If you do not understand this government, its history, and what \nour country is all about, you cannot qualify.\n  Do you call that amnesty? Does that sound like something that is \nautomatic, moving to the head of the line, a free ride? It is not. It \nis a hard, tough process.\n  I come to the floor--and I have said it before; I want to repeat it, \nas many have in their own personal circumstances--as the son of an \nimmigrant. My mother was brought to America at the age of 2 in 1911. My \ngrandmother brought her, her brother, and sister over on a boat from \nLithuania. They landed not at Ellis Island but in Baltimore. They \ncaught the train to St. Louis and went across Eades Bridge over to the \neast side of the river in East St. Louis, IL, to meet up with my \ngrandfather, who was working in common immigrant labor--steel mills and \nstockyards and things we did in that part of the world.\n  I do not know if my mother, who became a naturalized citizen in her \ntwenties, could have met the qualifications of this bill--all of them. \nThey are tough. They are demanding. I hope she could have, but she may \nnot have. Fortunately for me, she became a naturalized citizen. I am \nvery proud of that. She raised a family with my dad--three boys, and \none of them turned out to be the 47th Senator from the State of \nIllinois.\n  That is an American story, a story repeated over and over and over \nagain. We want this bill to reflect American values. We want this bill \nto basically say: We are going to fix a broken immigration system. We \nare going to repair our borders with real enforcement. We are going to \nmake certain that the employers who are making this situation even \nworse are going to be penalized. We are going to do that and give those \nwho are here a chance to become legalized.\n  The Presiding Officer up here from the State of South Carolina has \nbeen very articulate about this issue. He has spoken out in many \nplaces, and I admire the statements he has made. He has noted the fact \nthat there are many people currently serving in the U.S. Armed Forces \nwho are not citizens. That is a fact. You do not have to be a citizen \nto serve as a soldier. And many of them are risking their lives today, \nin uniform, for the United States of America. Over 50 have been killed \nin Iraq. They are not legally citizens but serving their country they \nlove, willing to risk their lives for this country.\n  It has been raised by the Senator from South Carolina, and others: \nWhat are we saying to them? What are we saying to those who have \nserved, those who have risked their lives and may come home having lost \na limb or suffering some serious injury? Are we saying to them that \ntheir parents, their family, must still live in the shadows of America? \nOr are we going to give them a chance? That is what this bill is all \nabout.\n  So we have a strong bipartisan bill, supported by the Senator from \nPennsylvania, supported by three other members of the majority party in \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  It is true. We have been rather steadfast in our belief that this \nprocess has to move forward. And we only have a few days to try to \ncapture the moment and to bring together the political forces to do \nsomething historic.\n  Last Saturday, I went to a high school in Chicago. Cristo Rey is a \nJesuit high school in an area of Chicago that has a largely Mexican \npopulation. It is an incredible school with dedicated teachers, \nadministrators who are trying to give kids a fighting chance. They know \nwhat the statistics tell us. Fifty percent of Hispanic Americans drop \nout of school. So they are fighting against the odds to keep these kids \nin school. I stood there on a stage with about 20 students from that \nhigh school and surrounding high schools, some who had graduated a few \nyears ago and some who were currently about to graduate. I listened to \ntheir stories.\n  Oscar Ramirez was there. I had met him before. He said: Senator, the \nlast time you met me, I was pursuing my degree in biology from the \nUniversity of Illinois in Chicago. I got it. I got my bachelor of \nscience degree in biology. Right now, I have applied for a master's for \nresearch in neurobiology. But once I get my master's degree--and I am \ngoing to get it--I am still undocumented. In the eyes of the \nGovernment, I am supposed to leave.\n  I ask my colleagues, is America a better place if Oscar leaves? Is \nthis country better that a person of that talent would leave us at this \npoint? He came here as a child. His parents brought him here. They \ndidn't ask for him to vote on where to live; they brought him. This is \nthe only land he has ever known. He defied the odds--not only graduated \nfrom high school, but he has a bachelor's degree and is going for an \nadvanced degree. Wouldn't we be a better country with Oscar Ramirez as \na citizen doing neurobiological research on Parkinson's disease and \nAlzheimer's? Wouldn't we be a better place?\n  Standing next to him was a young woman about to get her bachelor's \ndegree in the city of Chicago in computer science and math who said: \nAll I want to do is teach. I want to teach in high school. I hope that \nsome kids will be as excited about math as I am.\n  Can we give up on a person like that? Are we ready to say we don't \nneed them in America--thank you for dropping by, but you can go back to \nwherever you came from? I don't think so. I think what they bring to \nAmerica is exactly what we need--values that we cherish, values that \ndistinguish us from many other countries. Why is this such a great \nnation? Because it is a nation of immigrants and a nation of immigrant \nspirit, the spirit of those who were willing to get up and take a risk \nwhere others were not.\n  When my mother's family left the tiny village of Jurbarkas in \nLithuania, I am sure there were villagers around them shaking their \nheads, saying: What are they thinking? They are leaving their home, the \nlittle plot of land they are tending to grow vegetables. They are \nleaving the church where they were baptized, their language, their \nculture, to go to a place where they can't even speak the language. \nThat Kutkin family must be crazy.\n  It was a crazy family like my grandparents and many like them who \nhave made this great Nation. They brought here risk taking. They \nbrought here family values. They were going to stick together through \nthick or thin, and they did it. Because of them, because of their \ncourage and the courage of millions like them, we are a different \nnation. Where other nations are torn apart by divisions, our diversity \ngives us strength.\n  That is what this bill tries to capitalize on. That is what this bill \ntries to build on. It says: Let us take the strength of that immigrant \nspirit and build a stronger America for tomorrow. Create obstacles in \nthe path, create requirements, give people a chance to earn their way \nto citizenship. It is a hard, long path, but an important one.\n  The Senate bill we passed takes this comprehensive approach. It is \ntough. It is fair. We improve border security, deploy new technology, \nincrease our manpower, crack down on employers that are hiring millions \nof undocumented workers. We do need tougher\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\nenforcement. We believe that. But in the Judiciary Committee bill, we \nacknowledge something that Senator Frist, the Republican majority \nleader of the Senate, and Chairman James Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin did \nnot acknowledge--a strategy that focuses only on enforcement is doomed \nto fail. In the last decade, we tripled the Border Patrol agents in \nAmerica. We have spent eight times as many hours patrolling the border. \nDuring that same time, the number of undocumented immigrants has \ndoubled. Enforcement alone is not enough. We need a realistic and \ncomprehensive approach.\n  As the Department of Homeland Security acknowledges, mass \ndeportation, which we might hear on some of the cable talk shows, isn't \ngoing to work and will cost us billions of dollars if we try. Amnesty \nis not an option, simply waving our hand and saying to everyone who is \nhere: You are now legal citizens, enjoy America. That isn't the right \nthing to do, either.\n\n  What we try to do is find a reasonable middle ground. If we are \nserious about reform, we need to offer the chance for immigrants who \nwork hard, play by the rules, pay their taxes, learn English, a chance \nto become legal in America.\n  Incidentally, what Senator Kyl said earlier about those who should be \ndisqualified, I can't argue with him. When it comes to criminal \nrecords, let's be honest, if you want to be a citizen and you want to \ncommit crimes here, we don't want you. Can I be any clearer? If you \nwant to commit a violent crime, if you want to endanger the life of \nanother person with a sawed-off shotgun or commit crime of moral \nturpitude, you can leave right now. We don't need you, and we don't \nwant you. We make that clear in the bill. It is already there. If you \nwant to make it all the way to citizenship, you can't have a criminal \nrecord, period.\n  You have to have been employed since January 2004. Aliens who enter \nafter that date or who have not worked continuously since then would \nnot qualify. You have to remain continuously employed going forward. \nYou have to pay about $2,000 in fines and fees, pass a security \nbackground check, a medical exam, learn English, learn about our \nhistory and government, and pay all back taxes. And then, if you meet \nall of those requirements, you go to the back of the line so that \npeople who are trying to move forward in this convoluted, bureaucratic \nlegal process will still be in the front of the line before you.\n  It is clear that is not amnesty. That is a process, a long, arduous \nprocess. It is an 11-year pathway to citizenship.\n  We have an important bill before us, a bipartisan bill. We have a \nsingular opportunity to make history this week in the Senate. If we \npress forward with a bipartisan spirit, the same spirit that guided the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, we can achieve this. Having achieved it, we \nwill be able to say that we tackled one of the biggest problems facing \nAmerica today and dealt with it in a responsible fashion.\n  I will not renew my unanimous consent request because I know the \nSenator from Pennsylvania would object. There is no point wasting our \ntime in that regard. I thank him for his leadership. I know he is \ntrying to find some balance to build a bridge over the troubled waters \nof the Senate. But at this moment in time, we are prepared to move on \nthe four amendments we have agreed to and three others. We would like \nto do that, I say to the Senator from Georgia. The amendment which we \nare prepared to accept may not be the one you want today, but perhaps \nwe could get to your amendment at a later time. I hope we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we are at an impasse. The rules of the \nSenate have been used to block meaningful consideration of the pending \nlegislation. What we have before us is the committee bill which was \nvoted out 12 to 6. I believe it is a good bill. It is a very good bill. \nBut under our rules, it is subject to being amended. The Senators who \nwish to offer amendments are being stymied by the Democrats who are \nimposing technical rules--led by Senator Reid, the minority leader. \nThat is the brutal fact of life.\n  We worked hard to try to find some amendments where we could go \nforward and have votes. We came up with a list, but none were \nmeaningful. None would advance the core considerations of this \nlegislation.\n  The rules of the Senate are very complex. If an amendment is not \noffered prior to cloture--and cloture is the expression to cut off \ndebate--the amendment may not be voted upon, cannot be offered after \ncloture if it hadn't been offered before cloture. If anybody is \nwatching on C-SPAN 2, which I doubt--it is just too dull; perhaps not \nby comparison with what else is available on cable or over the air--the \nreason is that Senators do not want to make tough votes. Today, it is \nthe Democrats who don't want to make tough votes. But another----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will as soon as I finish.\n  Today, it is the Democrats who don't want to make tough votes, but \nthere have been days when it was the Republicans who didn't want to \nmake tough votes.\n  Senator Reid said that they were experts on being cut off from \noffering amendments because they have tried to offer amendments and \ncouldn't. And he mentioned the minimum wage and stem cells, among other \nitems. But there is a significant difference on what is happening today \nand yesterday during the pendency of this bill, and that is that the \namendments to be offered relate to the bill, are germane to the bill. \nSenator Kyl wants to offer amendments that deal with the text of the \nbill. When Senator Reid was talking about stem cells, he was talking \nabout hypothetically, or maybe he did try to offer a stem cell \namendment--I don't know--or tried to offer a minimum wage amendment, \nbut he tried to offer it on a bill which was not germane.\n  It makes sense to say we are not going to vote on stem cells on the \nhighway bill, illustratively. And although Senator Reid wants to vote \non stem cells, he hasn't pushed that issue as hard as I have. I have \nbeen working on the stem cell issue since it burst upon the scene in \nNovember of 1998. The subcommittee which I chair on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education has had 16 hearings on it. I am the \ncoauthor of the Specter-Harkin bill which has passed the House as the \nCastle bill. I really want to bring that up, but I can see not bringing \nit up on an unrelated bill. We are working now on a schedule. The \nmajority leader has committed to finding a time to vote on stem cells \nin the immediate future.\n  The point is that when the Democrats tried to offer amendments, they \nwere to bills where they were not germane. I think that is the \nsituation. I do not have all of the amendments in my hand, but be that \nas it may, there is no doubt that the amendments which Senator Kyl and \nothers want to offer relate directly to this bill. Although I would \nlike to pass this committee bill, we are not going to get a fair shot \nat it because we are not going to get cloture. After cloture is voted \ndown tomorrow, there is going to be a mass exodus for the airports and \nthe trains. People will be going on the Easter recess, and this very \nimportant piece of legislation is going to die.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. OK.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee if he recalls a few weeks ago on the reauthorization of the \nPATRIOT Act when Senator Feingold of Wisconsin offered amendments which \nwere germane postcloture but was not given an opportunity to call those \namendments because the Republican majority leader, Senator Frist, \nfilled the tree? There was no question that they were germane \namendments. Senator Feingold rightfully took to the floor and held us \nin session for days because the Republican majority would not allow \nvotes on germane amendments on the bill that came out of our committee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the thought that comes to my mind is, \nwere they subject to being offered postcloture, had they been offered \nprecloture? Don't they have to be offered precloture? The \nParliamentarian is shaking her head in the negative. Repeat the \nquestion, and I will try to answer that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that you can offer germane \namendments postcloture, but the question is\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\nwhether you can get into a queue where the amendment will be called. If \nthere is a pending germane amendment filed precloture, it may take \nprecedence in terms of being called, and you may not have an \nopportunity. I think you have a right under our rules to offer germane \namendments postcloture. Whether you will have a chance to call those \nfor a vote depends on the process on the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, as we have seen in so many situations, and where I \nhave been willing to concede error on both sides of the aisle, I am not \ngoing to seek to defend preventing votes on relevant, germane \namendments, whether they are offered by Senator Feingold or Senator \nKyl, or anybody else. That is just not the way the Senate ought to be \nrun. I am glad to note that the Senator from Illinois didn't hear my \nanswer. He was talking, which he has a right to do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I apologize to the Senator, who is very patient. I will \nlisten to his remarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is not worth repeating. It is my hope that sanity may \nyet return to this Chamber. If it existed, it has certainly departed. \nWe have, in all seriousness, a bill before us that is enormously \nimportant.\n  Senator Durbin spoke at some length a few moments ago, and I agree \nwith most of what he said. We have a tremendous problem in this country \nwith undocumented aliens. We need to get a handle on what is going on. \nWe need to not have a fugitive class in America that is being exploited \nby employers. We need to control our borders. We have a serious problem \nwith terrorism. We have a serious question whether the people coming \ninto this country are taking American jobs or depressing American \nwages. We are simply not dealing with it.\n  To have the Senate floor empty, and we are going to have a quorum \ncall most of the time unless people come over and talk about ideas, \nwhich are fine but are not advancing the progress of this bill. I think \nit is important that our constituents know we are at an impasse because \nof technical reasons advanced by the Democrats. I do not say that in a \npartisan sense. I have voted for many Democratic proposals and for many \nof President Clinton's judges and across the line on many occasions \nwhen I thought the ideas merited it, not as a matter of party loyalty.\n  The Democrats are stonewalling this bill and no one is even on the \nfloor to defend them, so I will not attack them anymore.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I want to pose a question to the \ndistinguished minority whip. Last Thursday, I offered amendment No. \n3215, which is second in line after the Kyl amendment. I have listened \nintently to the distinguished Senators from Illinois with regard to the \nobjections they have expressed to the Kyl amendment. I have not heard \nthem say what their objection is to amendment No. 3215.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois this question: Amendment No. 3215 is \na simple amendment, which says that any provisions of this act which \ngrant legal status to someone who is here illegally do not take effect \nuntil such time as the Secretary of Homeland Security has certified to \nthe President and the Congress that our borders are reasonably secure.\n  Now, I would like to hear what objection someone would have to the \nUnited States of America living up to its responsibility of securing \nour borders?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Georgia, I think \nit would be an interesting debate. We may reach that debate as to what \nis reasonably secure. There are some, as I understand it, 300 million \npeople who cross our border with Mexico every year in legal status, for \ncommercial purposes and otherwise, and whether we are secure under the \nSenator's amendment, I would have to listen to his arguments on who \nmakes the certification and what are the standards for that.\n  If we had a situation where the fate of millions of people hinged on \na subjective decision about reasonable security, I think that would \nraise some questions about whether we are moving forward and whether \npeople would say: I can step out of the shadows now and I think at this \npoint I am prepared to tell you who I am, where I live, where I work, \nand here are my records. If there is this uncertainty, at any given \ntime you could stop the process.\n  I say to the Senator from Georgia, it would be an interesting debate \nand I am anxious to hear his side of the argument.\n  His is 1 of 100 amendments that have been filed. One of his other \namendments we are prepared to take up immediately. I don't think that \nis the same one. We are prepared to take that up because we think it \nwould move the bill forward in a constructive, bipartisan way.\n  I would like to hear the Senator's argument before making a final \ndecision.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Reclaiming my time, my response to the Senator would be \nthat I am not an attorney, but I spent 33 years in the real estate \nbusiness. I saw the term ``reasonable attorney's fees'' on more \ndocuments than the law would allow. I never met an attorney who could \nnot describe what reasonable attorney's fees meant. I think we can find \na lot of people in the Senate who understand that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for a few moments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2863-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2863-S2896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NEGRO LEAGUES BASEBALL MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to talk \nabout last night's passage of S. Con. Res. 60, a resolution that \ndesignates the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, MO, as \nAmerica's National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. I can't think of a \nmore appropriate time of the year to have passed this landmark \nlegislation than this week--opening week of the 2006 baseball season. \nThe passage of this historic resolution will allow an already fantastic \nmuseum to grow and become even better.\n  That would be reason enough to pass a resolution here were the museum \non any other subject. But on this subject, which is so significant to \nthe history of America, it made the resolution, I think, even more \nimportant. I am grateful to the Senate for passing it last night.\n  Many of baseball's most noted stars of the past century got their \nbeginnings in the Negro Leagues. Greats such as Hank Aaron, Ernie \nBanks, Roy Campanella, Larry Doby, Willie Mays, Satchel Paige, and of \ncourse, Jackie Robinson eventually brought their fast-paced and highly \ncompetitive brand of Negro Leagues baseball to the Major Leagues. In \nfact, much of the fast-paced style of baseball today is owing to the \ninfluence of the Negro League's brand of ball.\n  Unfortunately, before the color bar was broken, many skilled African-\nAmerican ballplayers were never allowed to share the same field as \ntheir White counterparts. Instead, such players played from the 1920s \nto the 1960s in over 30 communities located throughout the United \nStates on teams in one of six Negro Baseball Leagues, including teams \nin Kansas City and St. Louis in my home State of Missouri.\n  The history of these leagues is an interesting one. In the late 1800s \nand early 1900s, African Americans began to play baseball on military \nteams, college teams, and company teams. The teams in those days were \nintegrated. Many African Americans eventually found their way onto \nminor league teams with White players during this time. However, racism \nand Jim Crow laws drove African-American players from their integrated \nteams in the early 1900s, forcing them to form their own \n``barnstorming'' teams which traveled around the country playing anyone \nwilling to challenge them.\n  In 1920, the Negro National League, which was the first of the Negro \nBaseball Leagues, was formed under the guidance of Andrew ``Rube'' \nFoster--a former player, manager, and owner of the Chicago American \nGiants--at a meeting held at the Paseo YMCA in Kansas City, MO. Soon \nafter the Negro National League was formed, rival leagues formed in \nEastern and Southern States and brought the thrills and the innovative \nplay of the Negro Leagues to major urban centers and\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nrural countrysides throughout the United States, Canada, and Latin \nAmerica.\n  For more than 40 years, the Negro Leagues maintained the highest \nlevel of professional skill and became centerpieces for economic \ndevelopment in their communities. The Negro Leagues constituted the \nthird largest African American owned and run business in the country in \nthose days. They brought jobs and economic activity to many of the \ncities around the United States and played in front of crowds of ten, \ntwenty, thirty, forty, and even fifty thousand people. These crowds \nwere integrated. White and Black fans came to watch the Negro Leagues, \nand they sat together.\n  In 1945, Branch Rickey of Major League Baseball's Brooklyn Dodgers \nrecruited Jackie Robinson from the Kansas City Monarchs, which made \nJackie the first African American in the modern era to play on a Major \nLeague roster. That historic event led to the integration of the Major \nLeagues and ironically prompted the decline of the Negro Leagues \nbecause, of course, Major League teams began to recruit and sign the \nbest African-American ballplayers.\n  If you stop and think about it, the integration of baseball was the \nfirst of the major events in the civil rights movement in this \ncountry--well, not the first, because that movement, of course, had \nbegun early in the last century. But it was the first significant \nwidely known event. Baseball was even more than it is today America's \ngame. The effect of this on the national consciousness, the progress \nthat made toward equality and justice for all people, cannot be \nunderestimated. That event occurred because of the Negro Baseball \nLeagues. Without those leagues, we would not have the pool of ability \nand excellent baseball players from which Branch Rickey was able to \ndraw when he came to an agreement with Jackie Robinson. Ironically, \nthough, that event, which led to the integration of the Major Leagues, \nprompted the decline of the Negro Leagues, because Major League teams \nbegan to recruit and sign the best African-American players.\n  The last Negro Leagues teams folded in the late 1960s. Much of the \nstoried history of these leagues was packed away and forgotten until \n1990 when the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum was founded in Kansas City, \nMO, to honor the players, coaches and owners who competed in Negro \nLeagues Baseball. This museum is the only public museum in the Nation \nthat exists for the exclusive purpose of interpreting the experiences \nof the participants of the Negro Leagues from the 1920s through the \n1960s.\n  It is not a hall of fame, Mr. President. We don't want it to be a \nhall of fame. The Negro Leagues' baseball players belong in the Major \nLeague Hall of Fame. They were segregated long enough. It is a museum \nthat exists in order to educate and enlighten people, and to allow them \nto enjoy the experience of the Negro leagues in the United States.\n  Today the museum educates a diverse audience through its \ncomprehensive collection of historical materials, important artifacts, \nand oral histories of the participants of the leagues. The museum uses \nonsite visits, traveling exhibits, classroom curriculum, distance \nlearning, and other initiatives to teach the Nation about the honor, \nthe skill, the courage, the sacrifice, the humanity, and the triumph of \nthe Negro Leagues and their players.\n  This resolution designates the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in \nKansas City as America's National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum. This \ndesignation will assist the museum in its efforts to continue the \ncollection, preservation, and interpretation of the historical \nmemorabilia associated with the Negro Leagues. This effort is a must if \nwe hope to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the experience of \nAfrican Americans and the African-American ballplayer during the trials \nand tribulations of legal segregations.\n  The full story of the Negro Leagues should be preserved for \ngenerations to come and the passage of this legislation gives the \nmuseum another tool to do just that.\n  I highly recommend a visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum for \nanybody who is in Kansas City. Whether you are a baseball fan or not, \nyou will be moved by what you see and the stories you are told at the \nmuseum. You will be encouraged and inspired in every way by seeing how \nthese players confronted the injustices of their times, and with great \nspirit and energy overcame all obstacles placed in front of them.\n  This museum is a first-class operation of 10,000 square feet in the \nhistoric 18th and Vine neighborhood in Kansas City. It entertains \n60,000 visitors a year. There is a number of key features to the \nmuseum, but I think the passage through which you can walk and see a \ntimeline of the Negro Leagues' development, and then next to it a \ntimeline of important events in American history and the civil rights \nmovement, is very enlightening and very moving. You will learn about \nthese leagues and the players as people, and through that and through \ntheir experiences, you will learn about the times. These were not \ndowntrodden men who played in this game, nor were the owners or the \nfans.\n  They were joyous. They played a game they loved, and they played it \nextremely well. Yet in the context of everything they did was the legal \nand social situation in the United States they were battling, over \nwhich they eventually triumphed.\n  Those who visit will be encouraged and inspired by seeing how those \nplayers confronted the injustices and other difficulties of their time \nwith great spirit and energy and overcame the obstacles in front of \nthem.\n  I congratulate everybody at the museum who continues to work so very \nhard to make sure the story of the Negro Leagues is a piece of history \nthat is preserved for future generations. The passage of this \nlegislation is an important way to honor the museum, its employees, all \nits volunteers and supporters for their years of tireless advocacy on \nbehalf of the baseball legends of the Negro Leagues.\n  I especially thank and congratulate Don Motley, Bob Kendrick, Annie \nPressley, and Buck O'Neil of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum for \ntheir dedication and assistance in passing this resolution.\n  I also thank Senator Durbin for cosponsoring this resolution with me \nand others who cosponsored it as well.\n  I am not going to take up much more time of the Senate. I know we are \ntaking a little break from the important immigration debate, but I \ncan't pass up the opportunity to put in a good word about my friend \nBuck O'Neil and the tremendous work he continues to do for the Negro \nLeagues Baseball Museum. Buck is a true American treasure whose \nillustrious baseball career spans seven decades. It has made him one of \nthe game's foremost authorities and certainly one of its greatest \nambassadors.\n  I am not going to go through all of Buck's statistics as a player, as \na manager in the Negro Leagues, or as the first African American who \nbecame a coach in the Major Leagues. He did so with the Cubs. In that \ncapacity, he discovered superstars such as Lou Brock, for which I am \nvery grateful. If he had been in control of the Cubs' front office, \nthey would not have traded Lou Brock to the Cardinals for Ernie Broglio \nin 1964, and they might have won a couple pennants themselves. So I am \ngrateful Buck was not the Cubs' general manager at the time. I don't \nthink he would have made that mistake.\n  In 1988, after more than 30 years with the Cubs, he returned home to \nKansas City to scout for the Kansas City Royals.\n  Today Buck serves as chairman of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum he \nhelped to found. The work he has done after he retired from the game \nmay be even more significant to the history of baseball than his \nexploits as a player or manager. Nobody has done more to build this \nmuseum and to call the rest of us to remember the significance of Negro \nLeagues Baseball than Buck O'Neil.\n  He has reminded us that the leagues are significant in so many ways \non so many different levels. They represent a triumph of the human \nspirit, tremendous sportsmanship, high quality of play, and were of \nvital importance to the African-American community of the time, and \nthey led directly to the integration of the Major Leagues.\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\n  The work of Buck O'Neil and the museum led the Hall of Fame to hold \nspecial elections earlier this year to elect a class of Negro Leagues \nand pre-Negro Leagues ballplayers into the 2006 Hall of Fame induction \nclass. On February 27, 2006, the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown announced \nthat 17 former Negro Leagues and pre-Negro Leagues players and \nexecutives would be inducted into the Hall of Fame in July 2006. That \nwas largely because of the efforts pushed by Buck and the Negro Leagues \nBaseball Museum and concurred in by Major League Baseball. It was a \nbittersweet day for me and many of us in Missouri because the one name \nmissing from that list of 17 players and executives was Buck O'Neil.\n  I certainly think there is nobody who meets the criteria for \ninduction into the Hall of Fame more than Buck. If you look at his \nstatistics on the field as a player, his years as a scout, his years as \na manager and a coach, even more than that, his years as an ambassador \nfor baseball, a happy warrior for the Negro Leagues and the Negro \nLeagues Baseball Museum, it more than qualifies him for admission into \nthe Hall of Fame. I hope we can find some way to correct this oversight \nquickly.\n  In closing, I thank the Senate for its patience. I thank my friend \nand colleague from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, for his assistance and \nsupport in moving this legislation swiftly through the Energy \nCommittee.\n  I thank the colleagues who supported the legislation and allowed it \nto pass by unanimous consent last night. The story of the Negro Leagues \nis a story of true American heroes who contributed to this Nation on \nand off the field and confronted life with courage, with sacrifice, and \neventually with triumph in the face of injustice. I hope the Members of \nthe Senate will take an opportunity when they are in the area to learn \nmore about these heroes by visiting what I hope and believe will soon \nbecome known as America's National Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in \nKansas City, MO.\n  I thank the Senate, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, if I may ask a question of the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Talent for his \nleadership on this important issue. As a person who lives in Mobile, \nAL, I am proud of Satchel Paige. I assume he will be in the museum.\n  Mr. TALENT. Yes; he has a big place in the museum.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Satchel Paige was denied the right to fully participate \nin American baseball until the very end of his career. That was a \ntragedy. It was really a tragedy. It is something our Nation cannot \ntake pride in and should feel great sadness over. A number of other \nNegro Leagues players came from Mobile, which is a great bastion of \nbaseball excellence, including Willie McCovey and Hank Aaron, among \nothers, who developed out of that history of excellent baseball.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for his leadership. I think it will \nbe an important addition to our national heritage to have this museum.\n  Mr. TALENT. I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, today I wish to pay homage to Buck \nO'Neil a splendid athlete, a peerless ambassador of baseball, and a \nwonderful man who has become an American icon beloved by millions.\n  Many people first got to know Buck O'Neil as a major contributor to \n``Baseball,'' Ken Burns's landmark documentary on our national pastime. \nWhile narrating the history of the Negro Leagues and the breaking of \nthe color line in Major League Baseball, Buck passed along not only his \nprodigious knowledge of baseball and the society it helped to change \nforever but also his indomitable spirit, joy of living, and love of the \ngame.\n  Before becoming a television star, Buck O'Neil was a baseball star in \nthe Negro Leagues. As a first baseman and manager between 1937 and \n1955, he played on nine championship teams and three East-West All Star \nteams, won a batting title, starred in two Negro Leagues World Series, \nand managed five pennant winners and five All Star teams. As manager of \nthe Kansas City Monarchs, he mentored more than three dozen players who \neventually made it to the Major Leagues.\n  In 1962, Buck O'Neil became the first African-American coach in the \nMajor Leagues, where he helped the Chicago Cubs' Ernie Banks, Billy \nWilliams, and Lou Brock develop the skills that led them to the \nBaseball Hall of Fame.\n  Today, at age 94, Buck is still bubbling over with enthusiasm for \nbaseball, life, and his fellow human beings. He continues to serve on \nthe Veterans' Committee at the Hall of Fame and as chairman of the \nNegro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City.\n  On May 6, 2006, the San Diego Padres will honor Buck O'Neil as part \nof their Third Annual Salute to the Negro Leagues. I am honored that \nthis statement will be a part of that salute, and I send my great \nadmiration and appreciation along to Buck O'Neil and all of the other \ngreat players of the Negro Leagues.\n  Mr. President, I know that you and all of our colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate will join me in sending our best wishes to Buck O'Neil for this \nvery special day and for many more years of great service to baseball \nand the Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Missouri as \nwell for his great words on behalf of the contribution to baseball that \nhas been made by some of our country's finest sportsmen.\n  I thank my colleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, for his good \nwork in this Chamber. I also note he and I were participants in a codel \nthat just went into Iraq and Afghanistan. The issues we face around the \nworld on national security are so important that it is going to require \na coming together of our country to make sure we are working toward the \ncreation of a better, safer, and more secure world.\n  I want to speak briefly to the bill that is currently before this \nChamber, and that is the immigration reform bill in its comprehensive \nform that came out of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe from a \nnational security and homeland security perspective this Chamber is \nworking on one of the most very important issues facing our Nation \ntoday, and that is the issue of making sure we take our broken borders \nand the lawlessness coming across the borders and create a system that \nis comprehensive in nature to address that lawlessness.\n  I believe the legislation which came out of the Judiciary Committee \ndoes that, and it does so by making sure, first and foremost, that we \nare strengthening our borders, and secondly, making sure that within \nthe interior, we are creating the kind of immigration law enforcement \nprogram that is going to be effective; that looking at the immigration \nlaws and simply ignoring them is a chapter which will go away if we are \nable to get our hands around passage of this bill. And finally, dealing \nwith the reality of the 11 million workers in America--those workers \nwho toil in our fields, those workers who work in our restaurants, \nthose workers who work in our factories, and all of those who make the \nkind of lifestyle we have in America possible--we need to address those \nissues with respect to what some have said is the big elephant in that \nroom, and we need to do it in a thoughtful and humane manner that \nupholds the rule of law of our Nation.\n  I want to speak briefly about the importance of border security and \nwhat this legislation does.\n  In the days after 9/11, when we have hundreds of thousands of people \ncoming into this country, without any sense of where they are coming \nfrom, whether they come here to seek a good job and to be a part of the \nAmerican dream, or whether they come as terrorists across the border, \nit makes the statement that we need to make sure we are doing \neverything within our power to strengthen those borders. This \nlegislation out of the Judiciary Committee does exactly that. It does \nso by adding 12,000 new officers to make sure our borders are being \npatrolled. We go from a staff level of about 12,000 Border Patrol \nofficers up to an additional 12,000 and that will get us to almost \n25,000 people who will be deployed along our borders to make sure we \ncan enforce the law.\n  It creates additional border fences in those places where we know now \nthere are significant streams of illegal and undocumented workers \ncoming back\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\nand forth across the borders. So it creates those additional fences.\n  It creates virtual fences by deploying the kind of technology that \nallows us to detect movement across our border.\n  It also makes sure we create the avenues for checkpoints and ports of \nentry so we don't have the massive backup on the borders on either \nside.\n  I believe the border security aspects of this legislation are where \nRepublicans and Democrats should come together in the name of national \nand homeland security, and we should be supportive of this legislation \nfor that very purpose.\n  Second, this legislation is also about enforcing our laws. It is \nabout making sure we have an immigration system where everyone in our \ncountry is standing up for enforcing the rule of law.\n  We will do that by providing an additional 5,000 new investigators to \nmake sure those laws are being enforced. Today there are many \nviolations of our immigration laws that are taking place across every \none of our States in America, and yet our immigration laws simply are \non the books. They are not being enforced. A law on the books that is \nnot being enforced is almost like not having a law at all. So what we \nwill do is hire 5,000 additional investigators and create the law \nenforcement capacity to make sure those laws are being enforced in the \ninterior.\n  In addition, when apprehension occurs of someone who is here \nillegally, it is difficult to find a place to house these individuals \nuntil they are deported. This legislation calls for an additional 20 \ndetention facilities. Those 20 detention facilities will give us the \ncapacity to process those who are breaking the laws of immigration.\n  The legislation also addresses a very important issue that is \ncritical to State and local governments. State and local governments \nhave been dealing with the influx of undocumented workers and illegal \naliens in our country for a very long time. Yet there has been no \nsystem providing them compensation for what they are doing to try to \nenforce the laws at the State and local level, essentially on behalf of \nthe Federal Government because this is a Federal issue, after all. What \nthis legislation will do is provide reimbursement for the States for \nthe detention and imprisonment of criminal aliens.\n\n  The legislation also requires a faster deportation process. I go back \nto the old adage of justice delayed is sometimes justice denied. We \nhave people who are sometimes waiting in the system for months and \nmonths and years and years without coming to any kind of resolution. \nThis legislation will require a faster deportation process.\n  There are significant provisions in this legislation that will make \nadditional criminal activity for gang members, money laundering, and \nfor human traffickers. We know human trafficking across the borders \ncreates tremendous hardship on people. It also demeans people and \nresults in the deaths of many people. We know there is gang activity \nalong the border that deals with drug trafficking and a whole host of \nillegal activity. We need to make sure those involved in that kind of \ncriminal activity are brought to justice.\n  Finally, in terms of enforcing our immigration laws, it is important \nwe address what has become an industry in this country in terms of \nproduction of fraudulent documents and identification cards used in \nthis country. President Bush's wish to create a tamperproof card that \nwill go along with this guest worker program is a step in the right \ndirection because it will get us to the point where we will have a \ntamperproof card and we can avoid the identity theft and identity fraud \nwe see going on in this arena.\n  Finally, I want to address a third point in what I consider to be \nthis law and order bill, and that is our penalties that come along with \nthis legislation for the 11 million undocumented workers who are in \nthis country. There is a monetary penalty that is applied. In addition, \nunlike all Americans, there is a requirement that those who are here \nand undocumented have to register, and they must register on an annual \nbasis. For all of us who are Americans, there is no requirement of \nregistration. If we don't want to have a Social Security card or if we \ndon't want to have a license or if we don't want to be a part of the \nGovernment, our right as an American citizen is not to register. For \nthis group of people, we are going to require them to register with the \nU.S. Government.\n\n  There is a whole host of other things that is required of these 11 \nmillion people, including the requirement that they learn English, \nincluding the requirement that they pass a criminal background check \nand that they pass a medical exam, and the list of requirements goes on \nand on and on. I believe the legislation that was produced by the \nJudiciary Committee is, in fact, a law and order bill. It addresses a \nvery fundamental issue that is of paramount importance to all of us in \nthis Nation and that is the security of our Nation and the security of \nour homeland.\n  Finally, I conclude by making a statement about the humanitarian \nissues that ought to concern all of us with respect to our broken \nborders. I heard my good friend Senator John McCain at the outset of \nthe consideration of this legislation by the Senate a few days ago, \ntalking about what he had seen in Arizona and how the Arizona Republic \nhad reported that, I believe it was in 2004, 300 people had been found \nin the desert. Later he discussed how in the following year there were \nsome 406 or 407 people who had been found dead in the desert, people \nwho had died of thirst and hunger, rape and pillage and murder, out in \nthe desert. Perhaps it is only in America when we see those kinds of \nconditions that we as an American society say, That ought to be \nunacceptable to us as a country. How can we have 300, 400, 500 people a \nyear die in the deserts of Arizona? That is the kind of inhumanity that \nought to cause all of us as leaders in our country and all of us in our \nsociety to say, We must do something about this.\n  I was moved by Senator McCain's description of some of the people who \nwere dying in the desert, including the story of the 2-year-old girl \nwho had died in the desert and the 13 year old who had died clutching \nher rosary in that desert in Arizona.\n  I believe America can, in fact, come to grips with this problem. I \nbelieve we have an opportunity here in the Senate to deal with this \nissue. I am very hopeful my colleagues, both my Democratic colleagues \nand Republican colleagues, who are working on this issue will not let \nthis historic opportunity we have pass us by. It is this time, it is \nthis day, it is this week where I believe we as a nation can come \ntogether and develop comprehensive immigration reform that is long term \nand that will be long lasting.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Salazar. We did indeed \nhave a most important trip to Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkey, \nand were able to delve into some of those matters that are so important \nto our national security and check on the quality of care our troops \nare receiving. I enjoyed that very much. He is a fine addition to our \nSenate. I think we have a lot of agreements on this legislation, and \nsome disagreements. I appreciate the opportunity we have to discuss \nthese issues.\n  This debate is often centered around whether we are dealing with \namnesty here, and I believe this legislation, by all definitions, is \namnesty. But first I want to ask the question: Why is this so? Why is \nit that people care about whether we use a word such as ``amnesty'' to \ndescribe what this legislation that is before us today is? Why is that \nimportant?\n  It is important because most of us, when we were out campaigning for \nelection, promised not to do amnesty again. Many people in this body \nwho voted for the 1986 amnesty bill agreed it was amnesty and said they \nwouldn't do it again. The President of the United States, President \nBush, despite all of his intentions to try to enhance legal immigration \nin our country, has always said he did not favor amnesty. So that is \nthe deal. I think the American people have a right to expect that those \nthey elect to office will honor what a fair interpretation of the \nmeaning of that word is. If you promise not to support amnesty, then \nyou shouldn't support a bill that is amnesty.\n  You can redefine words to make them mean most anything you want. My \ndefinition of an activist judge is a person who redefines the meaning \nof words to have them say whatever he or she would like them to say so \nthey can\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\naccomplish a result they consider to be desirable. But words do have \nmeaning. We can have some understanding of what these issues are about, \nand I want to discuss it in some detail.\n  Senator Kennedy said:\n\n       Many have called this adjusted status amnesty. I reject it. \n     Amnesty means forgiveness, not pardon.\n\n  Well, I don't know exactly what that means. He said: This bill is not \namnesty.\n  He goes on to say: ``Amnesty is not a pardon.''\n  Senator Durbin, the assistant Democratic leader, said: ``Amnesty \nbasically says, We forgive you.''\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Amnesty, very simply, is if you have been charged and found \n     guilty of a crime, amnesty says, we forgive you. We are not \n     going to hold you responsible for your crime.\n\n  But only if you have been charged and found guilty, apparently.\n  Senator Feinstein says: ``Amnesty is instant forgiveness, with no \nconditions. And there are conditions,'' she says, ``on this'' bill.\n  Senator Specter said:\n\n       Amnesty is a code word to try to smear good-faith \n     legislation to deal with this problem. It is not amnesty \n     because the law-breakers have not been unconditionally \n     forgiven of their transgressions.\n\n  And Senator McCain said also:\n\n       There is no requirements. There must be no requirement \n     whatsoever to call this bill amnesty.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Amnesty is simply declaring people who entered this country \n     illegally citizens of the United States and imposing no other \n     requirements on them. That is not what we do, Mr. President.\n\n  So in an effort to redefine this situation to mean what they want it \nto mean, they have said unless there is no condition whatsoever, you \ncan't have amnesty. But people agreed that 1986 was amnesty and placed \nquite a number of conditions--some more significant than the ones in \nthis bill--on those who were given amnesty.\n  Those of us who are familiar with the law world--I served as a lawyer \nthe best I could for a number of years, and I know Madam President is a \nlawyer--we know what Black's Law Dictionary is. It is a dictionary \nlawyers use to define words in their legal context. Black's Law \nDictionary, as part of its definition of the word ``amnesty,'' says \nthis:\n\n       The 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided \n     amnesty for many undocumented aliens already present in the \n     country.\n\n  Black's Law Dictionary, the final definition of legal words, says the \n1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for people \nhere. It had conditions on it. It had some conditions on it; it just \ndidn't have many conditions on it. So everybody recognizes it as \nbasically amnesty, and that is why they called it that.\n  Again, I am not trying to use a code word here. What I am saying is \nthere is a systematic effort in this body to redefine the definition of \namnesty so they can tell their voters back home that although they \nopposed amnesty, this bill is not amnesty, and that is why they voted \nfor it. That, unfortunately, I would have to say, is where we are.\n  What does the Democratic leader in the Senate, Senator Harry Reid, \nsay about what amnesty is? Does he say that 1986 was amnesty and it had \nquite a few restrictions on the movement to full benefits of \ncitizenship in the United States? This is what the Democratic leader \nsays. This is what he said on September 20, 1993, when making a speech \non the floor in the Senate; it is part of the Congressional Record. He \nsaid:\n\n       In 1986 we granted amnesty, and I voted against that \n     provision in law. We granted amnesty to 3.2 million illegal \n     immigrants. After being in this country for 10 years, the \n     average amnesty recipient had a sixth-grade education, earned \n     less than $6 an hour, and presently qualifies for the earned-\n     income tax credit.\n\n  The earned income tax credit is if you don't make enough money to pay \nincome taxes and don't pay income taxes, not only do you not have to \npay them but they give you money back. The average benefit for a person \nwho qualifies for the earned-income tax credit, I would say \nparenthetically if anybody is interested, is $2,400 per year.\n  So that is what Senator Reid had to say about it in 1993, that the \n1986 law was amnesty. I don't think anybody disputes that 1986 was \namnesty.\n  He made another speech. We have a chart and I want to refer to it \nbecause I want to drive this point home. On March 10 of 1994, the \nDemocratic leader in this body today, Senator Reid, said this:\n\n       In 1986, Congress gave amnesty and legal status to 3.1 \n     million individuals not lawfully residing here. . . . Even \n     after Congress has passed massive legalization programs, \n     millions of individuals do not lawfully reside in the United \n     States today.\n\n  That was true in 1994, a mere 8 years after the bill passed.\n  He continues:\n\n       And many more continue to cheat the rules and continue to \n     enter unlawfully.\n\n  That is a true statement, I submit, this very day.\n  So did the Democratic leader have any doubt that 1986 was an amnesty \nlaw? I don't think so. In fact, everybody knows it was. That is what we \ndefined it as.\n  I want to go over some of the provisions in that act and compare it \nto the provisions in today's act. Let's talk honestly here. There is no \nmystery here. I would submit, as several of the proponents of this \nlegislation have tried to do, that you only have amnesty if you put no \ncondition whatsoever on the person who is here illegally--and they put \nsome conditions on those persons. Therefore, they say, Oh, no, I know \nwe promised not to pass amnesty, but this isn't amnesty because there \nare conditions on the people who are here illegally. So there is no way \nto do this but go over it truthfully and analyze it and see what the \nfacts are.\n  This was passed in 1986. What did it require, this amnesty of 1986? \nIt required continuous unlawful residence in the United States before \nJanuary 1, 1982. That is 4 years before the passage of the 1986 act--\nmore than 4 years, because I am sure it didn't pass January 1. So for \nmore than 4 years you had to be here unlawfully before this act applied \nto you. That is a restriction, isn't it, on amnesty, under the \ndefinition of those who want to say the current act is not amnesty?\n  But what does the 2006 act say? Physically present and employed in \nthe United States before January 7, 2004--employed in the U.S. since \nJanuary 7, 2004; continuous employment is not required. So the key date \nhere is that you have to have been in the country before January 7, \n2004. So we are requiring under this bill that you have to live in the \ncountry illegally for 2 years before you get on this amnesty track.\n  Under the previous law, they required 4 years. So with regard to \n1986, I think it is a tougher standard, I submit, than we have in \ntoday's standard. I don't think anybody can dispute that.\n  Then you have a fee. They say they are paying a fine, a big fine. \nWell, in the 1986 act, they say there will be a $185 fee for the \nprincipal applicant, $50 for each child, a $420 family cap. Now we have \na $1,000 fine, but it does not apply to anybody under 21 years of age; \nthey don't pay anything. They paid $50 per child back in 1986. They \ndon't pay anything. I submit that is about a wash. There is a little \ndifference in money. You had an inflation rate; what difference is \n$1,000 to $420?\n  Both of them say you should meet admissibility criteria. That means, \nI suppose, that you are not a felon. That is one of the main criteria. \nBoth of them said that. Surely we are not going to be taking in felons \ninto the country. In fact, regarding this bill to which Senator Kyl and \nCornyn have offered an amendment--which apparently is being blocked by \nDemocratic Leader Reid from ever getting a vote--they are contending \nthat this criminality requirement is not in this bill. In fact, this \nbill is weaker than the 1986 bill on the question of that issue of \nwhether you have a criminal record.\n  In 1986, people were worried about welfare claims and so forth, so \nthey put in language that said you are ineligible for most public \nbenefits for 5 years after your application. They said if you are going \nto come here to be a citizen of the United States, we do not want you \ncome here to claim welfare. We are going to prohibit you from claiming \nwelfare for at least 5 years. After that, if you get in trouble and you \nneed help, we will help you. But you have to come here not with a \ndesire to gain welfare benefits in our country which exceed the annual \nincome of most people in a\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nlot of areas of the world. So they put that in. There is no such \nrequirement in our bill. None of that. You can immediately go on \nwelfare, presumably, under the legislation that is before us now.\n  It does require a background check and fingerprinting, but presumably \nthat was done in 1986, also. But it focuses really on the crimes a \nperson may have committed while they were in the United States. I don't \nthink it has a mechanism under this act to actually go back to the \ncountry of origin--whether it is Brazil or Canada or Mexico--to see if \nthey have a criminal history there. That is a weakness in the system. \nBut even if it does, those systems are so immature and nonexistent, it \nwould not be very effective, I suggest.\n  This requires an 18-month residency period. This one authorizes \nimmediately a 6-year stay in the country. So they said you have to stay \n18 months before you make your application for adjustment to permanent \nresident status. In this bill, you have to stay 6 years, so that is \ntougher. And you have to work. What are people here for if not to work? \nSpouses and children don't have to work. People are here to work. It is \nonly a minimal work requirement--not continuous employment--and the \nproof level is very weak. Regardless, presumably the people who are \nhere want to work, and they ought to be able to prove that they have.\n  Then you adjust to permanent resident status. That is the green card. \nIn 1986, it required English language and civics. So, in 2006, it is \nEnglish language and civics, a medical exam, payment of taxes--really? \nPresumably the people are paying their taxes. And Selective Service \nregistration. So you earn your right to stay in this country by coming \ninto the country illegally and paying your taxes. Thanks a lot.\n  Then the final step is, in 1986, you paid an $80 fee, $240 for a \nfamily. In this bill, it is a $1,000 fee and an application fee.\n  All I am saying is, if you add those up, I don't think a principled \ncase can be made that 2006, in terms of conditions of entry and amnesty \nin our country, requires any more stringent requirements on them than \nin 1986, which Senator Reid and everybody else, including ``Black's Law \nDictionary,'' have concluded was amnesty.\n  I say to my colleagues, I would be very dubious of someone who comes \nup to you and says: Now, Senator, I know you promised in your campaign \nrepeatedly, just as President Bush did, that you would not support \namnesty. Don't worry about it. This bill is not amnesty.\n  I am telling you, the American people are pretty fairminded, and they \nknow perfection is not possible for any of us. But this has not been an \nissue which has not been discussed. Everybody has talked about the \nfailure of the 1986 bill. As a result, we wanted to do something \ndifferent. We said we were not going to do that again and we were not \ngoing to grant amnesty. I submit this bill does. I wish it were not so.\n  We can pass legislation that will work. I have repeatedly said we can \npass legislation that has good enforcement. We can pass legislation \nthat provides fair treatment to the millions of people who are here. \nThey are not all going to have to be removed from our country and be \narrested and prosecuted. That is not so. That is not part of any plan \nhere. But we do need to recognize that we should not give every single \nbenefit to someone who came illegally that we give to those who follow \nthe law and come legally.\n  Senator Leahy, who says this bill is not amnesty, even admits this is \namnesty in 1986. He says:\n\n       Opponents of a fair comprehensive approach are quick to \n     claim that anything but the most punitive provisions are \n     amnesty.\n\n  I am not claiming that.\n\n       They are wrong. We had an amnesty bill. President Reagan \n     signed an amnesty bill in 1986.\n\n  I suppose he voted for it.\n\n       This is not an amnesty bill. Our bill is more properly \n     called what it is, a smart, tough bill. The amnesty bill was \n     signed by President Reagan in 1986, and this is different.\n\n  But it is not different. Fundamentally, it is the same thing. I \nsubmit that is indisputable, and that is why we have a difficulty here. \nSome of those masters of the universe, sitting up in those glass towers \nwho write editorials, and the Chamber of Commerce, they don't \nunderstand what it is like to campaign for office, look your voters in \nthe eye, and discuss directly with them the issues facing our country, \nand to make commitments to them about what you are going to do once you \nget elected. They can redefine the meaning of words and think that is \njust fine. They can just say whatever they want to and then write their \neditorials. But they don't have to answer to the people they looked in \nthe eye and directly told they would not support amnesty.\n\n  In fact, the President, despite his drive to fix immigration and to \nenhance the flow of immigration into our country, has said a direct \npath to citizenship--by Scott McClellan, just less than 2 weeks ago. \nScott McClellan said a direct path to citizenship and amnesty are two \nthings they don't favor.\n  Why is this important? After 1986, we ended up with a big problem. \nThings were not working well in our country. So 6 years after this \nhappened, in 1992, we did an evaluation by an independent commission of \nthat part of the act which dealt with agricultural workers as part of \nthe Immigration Reform and Control Act. That was the name of it, the \n``Immigration Reform and Control Act.'' We told American voters--or \nthose in the Congress at that time did--that we are going to control \nthe immigration system.\n  The congressionally created Commission on Agricultural Workers issued \na report to Congress that studied the effects of the 1986 agricultural \namnesty on the agricultural industry. They did a study on it because \nCongress wanted to find out what had really happened with regard to \nthat legislation they had passed. One of the first things the \nCommission acknowledged was that the number of workers given amnesty \nunder the bill had been severely underestimated. They said this:\n\n       The SAW program legalized many more farm workers than \n     expected. It appears that the number of undocumented workers \n     who had worked in seasonal agricultural services prior to the \n     Immigration Reform and Control Act was generally \n     underestimated.\n\n  That is page 1 and 2 of their report, the executive summary.\n  What else did the Commission find? Did it tell us that the 1986 \namnesty of 3 million farm workers solved our agricultural labor \nproblems? Was that the fix that people thought it would be? How did it \nwork?\n  No, their answer was this:\n\n       Six years after the IRCA was signed into law, the problems \n     within the system of agricultural labor continue to exist. In \n     most areas, an increasing number of newly arriving, \n     unauthorized [illegal] workers compete for available jobs, \n     reducing the number of work hours available to all harvest \n     workers and contributing to lower annual earnings.\n\n  That is page 1 of the Report of the Commission of Agricultural \nWorkers, executive summary.\n  What did the Commission recommend that Congress do? What did they \nrecommend, this independent, bipartisan Commission? Did the Commission \nrecommend that we pass a second legalization program such as the one \nfor agricultural jobs that has been made a part of this bill, offered \nin committee and is now part of the committee bill that is on the \nfloor? Did they recommend that as a second program to solve the illegal \nalien agricultural workforce dilemma that was still in existence in \n1992, 6 years after the amnesty that was supposed to end all amnesties \noccurred?\n  No, the Commission concluded just the opposite. They found:\n\n       The worker-specific and industry-specific legalization \n     programs as contained in the Immigration Reform and Control \n     Act should not be the basis for future immigration policy.\n\n  That is page 6 of their report.\n  What did the Commission suggest that Congress should do? They \nconcluded that the only way to have a structured and stable \nagricultural market was to increase enforcement of our immigration \nlaws, including employer sanctions, and to reduce illegal immigration.\n  You talk to anybody on the street, and they will tell you the same \nthing. You talk to Americans. Overwhelmingly, 80 percent believe we are \nnot enforcing the laws effectively on our borders, and any legalization \ntoday without an effective enforcement program in the future will bring \nus back to an amnesty situation just like we face now, just like they \nfaced in 1986.\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\n  The Commission said this:\n\n       Illegal immigration must be curtailed. This should be \n     accomplished with more effective border controls, better \n     internal apprehension mechanisms, and enhanced enforcement of \n     employer sanctions. The U.S. Government should also develop a \n     better employment eligibility and identification system.\n\n  This was 1993, 13 years ago. What has been done about it? Let me \nrepeat that. We need to establish a:\n\n       . . . better employment eligibility and identification \n     system, including a fraud-proof work authorization document \n     for all persons legally authorized to work in the United \n     States so that employer sanctions can more effectively deter \n     the employment of unauthorized workers.\n\n  What a commonsense statement that is. Wasn't that what they promised \nback in 1986 when we were going to have an amnesty to end all \namnesties? Remember that they said this would be a one-time amnesty and \nwe were going to fix the enforcement system and therefore the American \npeople would go with us on that. We are going to do this one-time fix \nand be generous to those who violated our laws. But trust us, we are \ngoing to fix the enforcement system in the future. That is what \nhappened.\n  We have known that for 14 years--that the key to securing our borders \nand ending illegal immigration includes more border enforcement, more \ninterior enforcement, and a foolproof worksite verification system. \nStill, we are not prepared to do that. We are told we should do the \nsame thing we did in 1986 on a much larger scale.\n  I note that in 1986, we estimated there were 1 million people here \nwho would claim amnesty. That is what people were told when the bill \npassed. After the bill passed, how many showed up? Three-point-one \nmillion people, three times as many.\n  I don't know where they are saying 12 million people, and that is how \nmany will be given amnesty now, not 1 million. They are saying there \nwill be 11 million and that those would all be given a direct path to \ncitizenship.\n  Let me point this out. When you adjust to permanent resident status, \nyou get a green card. You are able to stay here permanently, as long as \nyou live here, and after a period of time--5 years--you can make \napplication and you become a citizen. If you haven't been convicted of \na felony in the meantime, presumably if you don't pay your taxes and \ndon't get caught for it or don't get convicted of it, you can still do \nso. Presumably you are drawing welfare or Medicare benefits and those \nthings, you can still make application.\n  We added up the years. Maybe about 11 years in this process, 10 \nyears, maybe, in the 1986 act, and about 11 years in process. They are \nsaying it takes 11 years for you to become a citizen. That is what it \ntook for anyone who came here in the first amnesty and became a \npermanent resident. They didn't get to become a citizen the next day; \nthey had to go through the same process as this amnesty requires.\n  Let me explain why 1986 was a failure and why we can have every \nexpectation that 2006 will be a failure. I am going to be frank with \nour Members. I don't believe this is an extreme statement. I am \nprepared to defend it. I believe everyone here who is honest about it \nwill admit it.\n  In 1986, we passed amnesty, and it became law as soon as that bill \nwas signed. Those people were eligible to be made legal immediately in \nour country and placed on a track to citizenship that day--the day the \nbill was signed. What did we have about enforcement? We had a promise \nthat we were going to enforce the law in the future. We are going to \nfix this border, and we are going to have workplace enforcement.\n  That was a mere promise. It never happened because I don't think any \nPresident wanted it to happen. We went back to the problem when \nPresident Carter was here, President Reagan, President Bush, President \nClinton, and this President Bush. None of them have demonstrated that \nthey actually intend to enforce our border laws.\n  I used to be a Federal prosecutor. I used to deal with law \nenforcement issues. I actually prosecuted one day--I think when I was \nan assistant U.S. attorney--an immigration case, a stowaway on a ship. \nA bunch of them stowed away on a ship. I know a little bit about it.\n  But those actions which are necessary to make the legal system work \nwere never taken by our Chief Executives. We in Congress can study the \nproblem at the border, we can see what those problems are, and then we \ncan pass a law to try to fix it. We can say we want more border patrol, \nwe want more fencing, we want more UAVs, a virtual fence. We can pass \nthose things, but unless the executive branch really wants it to \nsucceed, then--even then, we may not get the thing to work.\n  The truth is, they should be coming to us. President Bush comes to us \nand says what he needs to win the war in Iraq, and we give it to him. \nIf he came to this Congress--I hate to say it because I think he is a \ngreat President and a great person, and I support him on so many \nthings. But he has never come to our Congress and said: Congress, this \nborder is out of control; I need A, B, C, and D, and I will get it \nunder control. So now he wants us to grant blanket amnesty to 11 \nmillion people, and after you do that: Trust me, I will get the border \nunder control. That is a sad fact. Securing the border is the \nPresident's responsibility.\n  What about Congress? We were in committee and we were debating the \nbill. I offered an amendment to add 10,000 detention beds for the \nBorder Patrol. I do not know how many they need. I think that is not \nenough. We are at 1.1 people coming into our country illegally every \nyear. The number of people other than Mexicans who really need to be \ndetained, sometimes for an extended period of time, has surged. We need \nthe detention spaces to make the system work. Do you know what they all \nsaid, Democrats and Republicans? Fine. We accept that amendment. \nSenator Feinstein and I offered an amendment to speed up the hiring of \nnew Border Patrol agents. They accepted that. Then it hit me. All who \nhave been in this body for some time know the difference between \nauthorization and spending the money, appropriations. In this body, \npeople authorize all the time.\n  I just left one of the finest groups of people you would every want \nto meet outside--national forensic science leaders from around the \ncountry. They came to see me because I supported a bill, and we passed \nit, the Paul Coverdell forensic sciences bill. It was to add $100 \nmillion to help jump-start forensic sciences in America. Do you think \nthat $100 million was ever appropriated? Certainly not. I think we may \nhave gotten to $20 million one year. Because you authorize money to be \nspent for forensic sciences or for immigration enforcement does not \nmean that it is ever going to get spent. It has to go through the \nappropriations process. Maybe they want to spend it on a project back \nhome. Maybe they decided we need more money for Katrina, health issues, \neducation, whatever. At the end of the day, you don't get the money. So \nwe have at least two major problems: One, will it ever be appropriated \nand two, if the money is appropriated, will the President actually use \nit effectively?\n\n  I admit that this Congress authorized a budget that set forth a \nprojected expenditure for immigration enforcement that is larger than \nthe President requested, but it remains to be seen if it will ever be \nfunded.\n  Those are the things which cause us great concern. So I would \nchallenge quite directly the people who support this bill and say this \nis going to be different than 1986 to come down on the floor of this \nSenate, look at their colleagues and people who may be watching back \nhome directly in the eye, and assure them that we are going to have the \nmoney and we are going to have the will to enforce this legislation.\n  I was on a radio talk show earlier today. I was asked about \nenforcement actions that were taken against certain big businesses \nrecently. They all called their Congressmen and complained, and the \nenforcement sort of went away. You have heard those stories. Do we have \nthe will to actually make this happen? I think we could. I am not \nhopeless about this. I think we could, but I don't get the sense that \nwe are there yet.\n  I have compared it to leaping across a 10-foot chasm but leaping only \n8 feet, and like the Coyote and the Roadrunner, you fall to the bottom \nof the pit. That is where we are. We have some things in this bill \nwhich make enforcement much more likely to occur, but it does not all \nget there yet. We need to do a number of things.\n  For example, employment: The workplace law and provisions in the bill \nare\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\nnot effective and do not cover all employees of an employer. It is a \ncritical step. You have heard it said that this bill has fencing in it. \nIt is the most minimal amount of fencing; it is nothing like a \nlegitimate fencing.\n  I wish to say this: Good fences make good neighbors. There is nothing \nwrong with a fence. There is nothing in the Scripture that says you \ncan't build a fence. You have thousands of people coming across the \nborder in a given area, and you have just a few Border Patrol officers, \nand they are trying to do their duty every day. And you say it is \nsomehow offensive or improper or against the Lord's will to build a \nfence to try to contain it so you can maximize the capabilities of the \nlimited number of Border Patrol agents who are out there putting their \nlives at risk this very day to try to enforce these laws? They arrest \n1.1 million a year. What possible objection could we have to legitimate \nfencing?\n  They built one in San Diego; it was an unqualified success. They said \nit could be breached. I am told the one in San Diego has never been \nbreached. What happened on both sides of the fence, where lawlessness, \ncrime, gangs, and drugs were disrupting entire neighborhoods? Those \nneighborhoods have been restored. They have come back strong. They are \nprospering. The property values are up as a result of bringing some \nlawfulness to a lawless area.\n  Let me say this. Why is it that there has been such an aversion to \nfences? I will tell you why. Because those who want to have open \nborders, who have no desire to see the laws enforced, know, first of \nall, that it will work; and second of all, they have used it to twist \nthe argument and to say that anybody who favors a fence wants no \nimmigration, they want to stop all immigration, they just want to build \na fence around America--totally mischaracterizing the need for a \nbarrier on our borders. That is not fair. That is wrong.\n  The amendment I offered would have increased substantially the number \nof border-crossing points, so lawful people could come back and forth \nfar easier and at less expense with a biometric card. They could enter \nand exit the country with it. This could work. We can make this work. \nWe need more legal exit and entry points, and we need to block the \nillegal entry points. If we do that and we send a message throughout \nthe world that the border is now closed and no longer open to those who \nwant to come illegally, I think we will have a lot less people \nwandering off in the desert, being abused by those who transport them, \nand putting their lives at risk and many of them dying.\n  That is what you need to do. I am prepared to support any legislation \nthat would increase legal immigration. When we end illegal immigration, \nwe are going to need to increase the opportunity for people in numbers \nto come here lawfully, and we need to increase the exit and entry \npoints.\n  Another thing. I mentioned this biometric card and entering and \nexiting the country. Let me tell you why some of us are concerned about \npromises in the future.\n  We passed, 10 years ago, the US-VISIT program. It is supposed to do \njust what I said. A person comes to this country legally, comes with a \ncard. It is a computer-read card, and the person is then approved for \nentry. They need a biometric identifier, a fingerprint, and it can read \nthat. You are allowed to come in. It also calculates when you leave, so \npeople who do not leave can be identified and removed because they \ndidn't comply with the law.\n  Well, 10 years after passing that bill, we still don't have that \nsystem up and running. They tell us that this summer, we will have some \npilot program which can actually identify those when they exit in \ncertain border places, which, of course, means it is no system at all.\n  We authorized 10 years ago a perfectly logical, sensible system to \nmonitor the legal entry of people into our country, monitor their exit. \nWhat we have learned, particularly after September 11, is that many of \nthe terrorists were overstays. They came lawfully, but they did not \nexit on time.\n  We need additional bed space. This is so basic. Not an unlimited \nnumber of beds, but we need more. What is happening is, people come \nacross the border, and particularly those other-than-Mexicans cannot be \nreadily taken back across the border and dumped if they are from \nBrazil, Russia, or China. What do we do with these people? They need to \nbe held and they need to be transported back. We are doing that, to \nsome degree.\n  But what happens when we do not have the bed space? This is what \nhappens. I read a newspaper article in the committee a couple of months \nago on this very subject. People come in from foreign countries. They \ncome into the border, enter illegally, head off across the desert, they \nsee a border patrol officer and they are told to go up to the border \npatrol officer and turn themselves in.\n  Why would they do that? The border patrol officer puts them in the \nvan or his vehicle and he takes them another 100 miles inside the \nborder to the Customs and Border Protection Office and they are taken \nbefore an administrative officer. What does the administrative officer \ndo? He does not have any beds or place to put them, so he says we will \nhave a hearing on whether you are legally here. We will have a hearing \nand we will set it in 30 days. I will release you on bail; come back in \n30 days.\n  How many do you think come back? The newspaper reporter said at the \nplace he examined, 95 percent did not show up. So all we have done is \nsend the border patrol agents out to pick them up and transport people \ninto the country illegally. That does not make sense. We have to have a \ncertain amount of detention space.\n  We have an insufficient number of Border Patrol agents. There are \njust not enough. We need to get to that tipping point where people \nrealize it is not going to work if they try to enter illegally. We \nadded some Border Patrol agents in committee, but they say it takes \nyears to hire them. That is why we passed, 5 years ago, legislation to \nadd increased numbers of Border Patrol agents. Senator Kyl got that \nthrough. Being on the Arizona border, he knew the problem. What \nhappened? They still have just now been hired 5 years later. They say \nit is hard to hire enough people.\n  I was reading recently a book on World War I. When World War I \nstarted, we had 130,000 people in our Army, and 18 months later we had \n4 million people in uniform, 2 million of them in France. To say we \ncannot add 10,000 trained Border Patrol agents and get them trained in \na prompt period of time is not credible. There has been a lack of will \nto see this occur. Who is to say if we pass this legislation we will \nhave a renewed will in the future? The American people have a right.\n  We had a hearing on Monday in the Judiciary Committee. It dealt with \nthe problem of the appeals being filed by people who object to being \nreturned to their country. Since 2001, 4 years, we have had a 600-\npercent increase in appeals to the Federal court, court of appeals. You \ncan legitimately appeal a determination you are in the country \nillegally, but a sixfold increase in 4 years? What has that resulted \nin? It has resulted in a 27-month delay before your case is heard.\n  What does this tell an immigration lawyer who is meeting with a \nperson who has been apprehended and who has an appeal pending about \nbeing deported and the guy or the woman does not want to leave the \ncountry and says, if you appeal, even if it is frivolous, it will be 27 \nmonths before anyone ever reads it or makes a decision. That is why we \nare having this surge. That system is broken.\n  Senator Specter, Judiciary Committee chairman, had legislation in his \nbill in the Judiciary Committee to help fix it--not completely, I \ndidn't think--that made a substantial step toward fixing this broken \nsystem. They offered an amendment in committee to strip that language \nand it passed. So not only did we not improve the bill and have not \nimproved the bill with regard to fixing the broken system, but we \nstripped language that would have made a good step forward in fixing.\n  What does that say about the intent of the Members of this Congress \nto actually see the immigration law be enforced?\n  I repeat once again, our nation is a nation of immigrants. We believe \nin immigration. We have been enriched by immigration. But our Nation is \na sovereign nation and it has a right to decide how many people come \nand what kind of skill sets they bring. Once it makes that decision, it \nshould create a\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\nlegal system that will make sure that occurs. We have not done that.\n  As a result, in 1986 we provided amnesty, which no one disputes. Not \nSenator Leahy, not Senator Reid. We gave amnesty in 1986, thinking we \ncould fix it once and for all. And 20 years later we end up with not 3 \nmillion people here illegally but at least 11 million people here \nillegally and no enforcement mechanism close to being in place that \nwould actually work. I encourage my colleagues to think carefully. We \ncan fix our border enforcement. We can increase the number of people \nwho come here illegally. We can tighten up the workforce workplace very \neasily. We can make this system work.\n  As we tighten up the border, we eliminate the magnet of the \nworkplace, we can reach that magic tipping point where all of a sudden \nthe message is going out around the world that if you want to come to \nAmerica, the border is closed. You better wait in line and file your \napplication and come lawfully because if you come unlawfully, it won't \nwork. Then we will have a massive flip. We will not see so many bed \nspaces. We may not even need as many Border Patrol agents as we have \ntoday. But that message is not out there. In fact, the opposite is out \nthere. If we pass this bill, it will be business as usual. We should \nnot do it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                             Port Security\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to report on some of the \nprogress we have made in our effort to secure our Nation's ports and \nour cargo container system.\n  This morning, I testified before the Senate Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs about the GreenLane Maritime Cargo \nSecurity Act which I introduced last year with Senators Collins, \nColeman, and Lieberman. That critical and effective bill is on the fast \ntrack both in the House and in the Senate.\n  While that hearing was starting, we received another urgent reminder \nof why we need to improve our cargo security in this Nation. This \nmorning, this very morning at the Port of Seattle, 21 Chinese nationals \nwere discovered. They had been smuggled into the United States in a \ncargo container. That incident is a stark remainder that we today are \nstill not doing enough to keep our cargo container system secure. This \nappears to have been a case of human smuggling, but that cargo \ncontainer could have been filled with anything from a dirty bomb to a \ncell of terrorists. Today our country is vulnerable to a terrorist \nattack. Time is not on our side.\n  I will spend a few minutes this afternoon outlining the threat and \nexplaining how our legislation helps. By using cargo containers, \nterrorists can deliver a one-two punch to our country. The first punch \nwould create an untold number of American casualties. The second punch \nwould bring our economy to a halt.\n  Cargo containers carry the building blocks of our economy, but they \ncan also carry the deadly tools of a terror attack. Today we are not \ndoing enough to keep America safe.\n  In the Senate it can feel as though the dangers at our ports are \nmillions of miles away, but in recent years some in our Government have \nsaid they could never have imagined the devastation caused by recent \ndisasters.\n  Let me make this crystal clear. On March 21, 2 weeks ago, a container \nship called the Hyundai Fortune was traveling off the coast of Yemen \nwhen an explosion occurred in the rear of that ship. Here is a photo of \nwhat happened next. About 90 containers were blown off the side of the \nship, creating a debris field 5 miles long. Thankfully, there were few \nfatalities and the crew was rescued. They are still investigating the \ncause. It does not appear at this time to be terrorist related.\n  Imagine this same burning ship sitting a few feet from our shores in \nNew York, or Puget Sound, off the coast of Los Angeles, Charleston, \nMiami, Portland, Delaware Bay, or the Gulf of Mexico. Imagine we are \nnot just dealing with a conventional explosion but we are dealing with \na dirty bomb that has exploded on America's shore. Let me walk through \nwhat would happen next.\n  First, there would be an immediate loss of life. Many of our ports \nare located in or near major cities. If there was a nuclear device \nexploded at a major port, up to a million people could be killed. If \nthis was a chemical weapon exploding in Seattle, the chemical plume \ncould contaminate our rail system, Interstate 5, Sea-Tac Airport, not \nto mention our entire downtown business and residential areas. At the \nport there would immediately be a lot of confusion. People would try to \ncontain the fire. But it is unclear today who, if anyone, would be in \ncharge.\n  Then, when word spreads that it is a dirty bomb, panic is likely to \nset in and there would be chaos as first responders try to react and \npeople who live in the area try to flee.\n  Next, our Government would shut down every port in America to make \nsure there were not any other bombs or any other containers in any one \nof our cities. That shutdown would be the equivalent of driving our \neconomy right into a brick wall and it could even spark a global \nrecession. Day by day we would be feeling the painful economic impact \nof such an attack. American factories would not be able to get the \nsupplies they needed. They would have to shut their doors and lay off \nworkers. Stores across our country would not be able to get the \nproducts they need to stock their shelves.\n  In 2002, we saw what a closure of just a few ports on the west coast \ncould do. It could cost our economy about $1 billion a day. Now, \nimagine if we shut down all of our ports. One study concluded that if \nU.S. ports were shut down for just 12 days, it would cost $58 billion.\n  Next, we would soon realize we have no plan for resuming trade after \nan attack--no protocol for what would be searched, what would be \nallowed in, or even who would be in charge. There would be a mad \nscramble to create a new system in a crisis atmosphere.\n  Eventually, we would begin the slow process of manually inspecting \nall the cargo that is waiting to enter the U.S. ports. One report has \nfound it could take as long as 4 months to get it all inspected and \nmoving again.\n  Finally, we would have to set up a new regime for port security. I \ncan bet you that any new rushed plan would not balance strong security \nwith efficient trade.\n  The scenario I just outlined could happen tomorrow. We are not \nprepared. Nearly 5 years after September 11, we still have not closed a \nmajor loophole that threatens our lives and our economy. Time is not on \nour side. We must act.\n  I approach this as someone who understands the importance of both \nimproving security and maintaining the flow of commerce. My home State \nof Washington is the most trade-dependent State in the Nation. We know \nwhat is at stake if there were an incident at one of our ports. That is \nwhy I wrote and funded Operation Safe Commerce, to help us find where \nwe are vulnerable and to evaluate the best security practices. It is \nwhy I have worked to boost funding for the Coast Guard and have fought \nto keep the Port Security Grant Program from being eliminated year \nafter year.\n  Right after 9/11, I started talking with security and trade experts \nto find out what we need to be doing to both improve security and to \nkeep our commerce flowing. Ten months ago, I sought out Senator Collins \nas a partner in this effort. I approached Senator Collins because I \nknew she cared about this issue. I knew she had done a lot of work on \nit already, and I knew she was someone who would get things done. Since \nthat day, we have worked hand in hand to develop a bill and move it \nforward. I am very grateful to Senator Lieberman and Senator Coleman \nfor their tremendous work on this issue as well.\n  The GreenLane Act, which we had a hearing on this morning, recognizes \ntwo facts: We must protect our country and we must keep our trade \nflowing.\n  We know we are vulnerable. Terrorists have many opportunities to \nintroduce deadly cargo into a container. It could be tampered with any \ntime from when it leaves a foreign factory overseas to when it arrives \nat a consolidation warehouse and moves to a foreign port. It could be \ntampered with while it is en route to the United States.\n  There are several dangers. I outlined what would happen if terrorists \nexploded a container in one of our ports.\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\nBut they could as easily use cargo containers to transport weapons or \npersonnel into the United States to launch an attack anywhere on \nAmerican soil.\n  The programs we have in place today are totally inadequate. Last May, \nthanks to the insistence of Senators Collins and Coleman, the \nGovernment Accountability Office found that C-TPAT was not checking to \nsee if companies were doing what they promised in their security plans.\n  Even when U.S. Customs inspectors do find something suspicious at a \nforeign port, they cannot today force that container to be inspected. \nSo we have a clear and deadly threat. We know current programs are \ninadequate. The question is, what are we going to do about it? We could \nmanually inspect every container, but that would cripple our economy.\n  The real challenge here is to make trade more secure without slowing \nit to a crawl. That is why Senators Collins, Coleman, Lieberman, and I \nhave been working with the stakeholders and experts to strike the right \nbalance. The result is the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act. That \nbill provides a comprehensive blueprint for how we can improve security \nwhile we keep trade efficient.\n  At its very heart, this challenge is about keeping the good things \nabout trade--speed and efficiency--without being vulnerable to the bad \nthings about trade--the potential for terrorists to use our engines of \ncommerce.\n  Our bill does five things.\n  First, it creates tough, new standards for all cargo. Today we do not \nhave any standards for cargo security.\n  Secondly, it creates what we call the GreenLane option, which will \nprovide an even higher level of security. Companies that join it have \nto follow the higher standards of the GreenLane cargo. Their cargo \nwould be essentially tracked and monitored from the moment it leaves a \nfactory floor overseas until it reaches the United States. We will know \neverywhere that cargo has been. We will know every person who has \ntouched it. And we will know if it has been tampered with. The \nGreenLane essentially pushes our borders out by conducting inspections \noverseas before cargo is ever loaded onto a ship bound for the United \nStates. We provide incentives for companies to use the highest \nstandards of GreenLane.\n  Third, our bill sets up a plan to resume trade quickly and safely, to \nminimize the impact on our economy.\n  Fourth, our bill will secure our ports here at home by funding port \nsecurity grants at $400 million.\n  And, finally, our bill will hold DHS accountable for improving cargo \nsecurity. DHS is long overdue in establishing cargo security standards \nand transportation worker credentials. We need to hold DHS accountable, \nand our bill provides that infrastructure to ensure accountability and \ncoordination.\n  I thank all of our cosponsors and our partners. I especially thank \nSenator Collins for her tremendous leadership. She chaired the hearing \nthis morning, and her expertise and her commitment were clear to \neveryone in the hearing room.\n  I also thank Senator Coleman for his leadership and his work as \nchairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. Senator \nColeman has helped expose our vulnerabilities and has worked to develop \nsolutions.\n  I also thank Senator Lieberman for his leadership and support. I \ncommend our cosponsors, including Senators Feinstein, Snowe, and \nDeWine.\n  I would add, we are also beginning to see progress on the House side \nwith the SAFE Port Act. I thank Representatives Dan Lungren and Jane \nHarman for their leadership on that side.\n  Today we have a choice in how we deal with cargo security challenges \nfacing us. But if we wait for a disaster, our choices are going to be \nmuch starker. Let's make the changes now, on our terms, before there is \na deadly incident. Let us not wait until a terrorist incident strikes \nagain to protect our people and our economy.\n  Two months ago, the people of America woke up and spoke out when they \nheard that a foreign government-owned company could be running our \nports. That sparked a critical debate. Now we need to set up a security \nregime that will actually make us safer. Until we do so, none of us \nshould sleep well at night. A terrible image such as this one--a \nburning container ship with a dirty bomb in one of America's harbors--\ncould be on our TV screens tomorrow. So this Congress must act today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to return to the issue before us \nand which has been before the Senate for the last week and a half, and \nto say it has been my pleasure to work on the issue of immigration \nreform and border security ever since I have been in this Senate--a \nlittle over 3 years now.\n  As a Senator from a border State, it will come as no surprise that I \nhave actually spent a fair amount of time along the border talking to \nmy constituents, as well as visiting Mexico and other countries that \nare a source of a large number of immigrants who come to our country \nseeking a better life.\n  I believe that experience has given me some insight into what the \nchallenges we have are when it comes to border security. Of course, we \nhave proposals before this body to deal with this issue of our porous \nborders and the need to find some way to deal with the workforce \ndemands of this growing economy of ours.\n  We need comprehensive immigration reform. I have consistently called \nfor comprehensive reform because I believe we will not fix the broken \nimmigration system unless we address all aspects of the problem; that \nis, border security; interior enforcement; worksite enforcement; and \nthe 12 million who are in our country without authorization, finding \nsome way to allow them to reenter our immigration system legally, and \nto give them a second chance living in the country, not in the shadows \nbut out in the open, and enjoying the benefits and protection of our \nlaws.\n  This is, as we have all discovered, an exceedingly complex issue. And \nno one--no one--has a monopoly on all wisdom or on suggestions for ways \nto improve the system. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, has one \namendment pending that I believe will improve the proposal on the floor \nof the Senate, which is the bill produced by the Judiciary Committee. \nHe has sought a vote, and I have joined him in seeking a vote, on that \namendment to the bill that is on the floor. I have several other \namendments that have been filed that will also, in my opinion, improve \nthe work of the committee.\n  But we have been denied an opportunity to have those amendments \nconsidered and voted on by the Senate because the Democratic leader has \nsimply refused to allow any amendment that he personally does not agree \nwith to get a vote. We have had three votes in the last week and a \nhalf, relatively--I should say completely noncontroversial votes--but \nthe Democratic leader has refused to let the Senate vote on Senator \nKyl's amendment.\n  This is particularly troubling to me because it is one that I believe \nthe American people would wholeheartedly agree with, and that--whatever \nwe decide to do with regard to the 12 million people who are currently \nliving in our country in the shadows and outside the law--we ought to \nmake sure whatever we do does not include a blanket amnesty for 500,000 \nor so felons, individuals who have committed at least three \nmisdemeanors, and those who have had their day in court, who are under \nfinal orders of deportation or who have agreed to voluntarily leave the \ncountry once they have been caught in the country illegally.\n  Those individuals, either because they have had their day in court or \nbecause they are, in fact, felons or people with criminal records, \nought not to get the benefits, whatever they may ultimately be, of the \namnesty that is proposed in the underlying bill.\n  This is especially troubling to me because, as I have said earlier, \nif you look at what happened in 1986, with the Immigration Reform Act \nthat was passed then, Congress, in effect, told America you should \ntrust us to enforce the laws, but, of course, as we now know, that did \nnot happen. Indeed, when the amnesty was granted in 1986, some 3 \nmillion people stood to benefit from that amnesty.\n  I have demonstrated here on the floor that that amnesty, which we all \nagree, in fact, meets that definition, was a complete and total \nfailure. The reason why it was a complete and total failure is because \nthe American people were,\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\nin essence, told one thing and Congress did another.\n  I believe the American people will forgive an awful lot of mistakes, \nbut they will not forgive being fooled twice. The proposal that is on \nthe floor now, the committee bill that is being proposed, would, in \nfact, be a repeat of what happened in 1986, except to the extent that \nit is actually even worse because in 1986, in order to get the benefit \nof the amnesty, you could not be a felon, you could not be a person \nwith at least three misdemeanors, but under this bill, as offered and \nas voted out of the Judiciary Committee, you can. Thus, you can see the \nimportance of having a vote on this amendment, which we have been \ndenied, even though it was offered last Friday.\n  Now here we come up on the midweek, and we are going to have a recess \nof Congress for the next 2 weeks after this Friday, and I am afraid \nthat because of the lack of movement and progress on this bill, there \nare going to be some who are going to be blamed for our inability to \nmove forward. And I submit--I hate to say this, but I submit that the \nblame lies on those who simply denied the greatest deliberative body on \nthe planet from the chance to actually consider and vote on amendments \nto this bill.\n  This is not democracy. This is not what we are trying to export to \nother countries that have known nothing other than the boot heel of a \ntyrant. This is not our finest hour because what we are seeing is the \nminority leader on the other side simply denying democracy in \naction. It is intolerable and inexcusable.\n\n  It is clear to me that if we are unsuccessful in getting this bill \nthrough the floor and passed and an opportunity for the process to \nreconcile the differences between the Senate and the House version, \nshould we get a Senate version, the blame will lie at the feet of the \nDemocratic leader.\n  One of the things Congress promised the American people in 1986 was \nthere would actually be a fraud detection system as part of the amnesty \nthat was then granted to make sure it would actually be successful and \nthat we would not have to find ourselves in the condition we are in \ntoday where at the time we had 3 million who benefited from the amnesty \nand now today the potential number is 12 million. We know the potential \nfor amnesty is a huge magnet for those who come to this country in \nviolation of our immigration laws. I don't want to find the Senate, 5 \nor 10 or 20 years from now, saying: In 1986, it was 3 million who \nwanted to benefit from amnesty. In 2006, it was 12 million. And 20 \nyears from now we find the number is 24 million.\n  We know this is a national security problem. We know that we have, as \na sovereign nation, a right to protect our borders. We know there are \non average 2,300 people coming into our country each day. Each day the \nDemocratic leader denies us an opportunity to fix that problem, to \nallow the process to go forward, we are seeing 2,300 more people come \ninto the country illegally. I hope and pray it is not a criminal, a \nterrorist, someone who intends to do us harm but, indeed, it could well \nbe.\n  The Democratic leader supports a bill that would grant an automatic \npath to citizenship for 12 million people who are in this country in \nviolation of our immigration laws, yet he won't allow a vote on an \namendment that would bar felons and repeated criminal offenders from \nparticipating in the program. He argues that he likes the bill voted \nout of the Judiciary Committee and doesn't believe that amendment will, \nin fact, improve it. He certainly is entitled to his opinion, but he is \nnot entitled to obstruct the process. He is not entitled to dictate to \nthe Senate or the American people what this particular legislation will \nlook like.\n  I simply don't understand why this amendment, that would bar felons \nand repeat offenders and which actually clarifies that they can't be \ngiven whatever benefit will be conferred by this bill, would create any \ncontroversy whatsoever. If the American people were polled or asked, do \nyou think we ought to bar convicted felons, do you think we ought to \nbar repeat criminal offenders from the grant of amnesty, I think they \nwould say yes. If given an opportunity for a vote on the floor, this \nbody will say yes, because we are representative of the American \npeople. Yet we have been denied that chance for a vote.\n  There is simply a credibility gap with the American people on \nimmigration and border security. Congress needs to openly debate and \nvote on amendments so there is transparency regarding who will receive \ngreen cards and whether there are sufficient protections against fraud \nthat ran rampant during 1986, with the amnesty that was granted at that \ntime. As someone who has worked on this issue and devoted time to it, I \nwant nothing more than the opportunity to debate and vote on \namendments. I am interested, and I believe most Senators are actually \ninterested, in trying to find a solution to this problem. But we are \nmet with obstruction and a refusal to let the process move forward. It \nis simply unacceptable.\n  We cannot debate and vote on amendments until there has been an \nagreement on who will participate in the program and the extent to \nwhich fraud can be detected and prevented. Yet the Democratic leader \ndoes not believe it is necessary to secure the confidence of the \nAmerican people that Congress is not giving amnesty to felons or repeat \ncriminal offenders. Without public debate and votes with regard to the \nfoundation of this proposal, none of us will be able to return home and \ndefend the broader policy implications of this complex legislation.\n  The Kyl amendment has been pending since last Thursday. Not a single \nSenator has voted to table that amendment. Yesterday we went through a \nstrange exercise where, in order to determine how we can obtain some \nprogress on this bill, there was actually a motion to table the Kyl \namendment that would bar felons and repeat criminal offenders. Every \nsingle Senator who voted voted not to table the amendment. Ordinarily \nthat would indicate an agreement with the amendment. Yet we were not \ngiven an opportunity to vote on the amendment. The amendment ordinarily \nwould be accepted by the manager of the bill or would be subject to a \nvoice vote and become part of the larger bill, but that didn't happen \nbecause we, unfortunately, have some people in the process who are not \ninterested in finding solutions. They are not interested in allowing \nthe process to move forward but, rather, they are more interested in \ntrying to jam their solution down the throat of the rest of the Senate \nand to deny the rest of us a chance to offer suggestions and to get \nvotes.\n  I don't like to lose any more than anyone else, but I am willing to \nsubmit to this body amendments that I have and on which I wish to have \na vote. I hope to persuade my fellow Senators that these amendments are \nactually an improvement over the bill that is before the Senate. But if \nthis body decides, 51 or more Senators decide, to vote against those \namendments, I am willing to accept that. That is democracy. That is \nmajority rule. But to simply defy majorities and the process and say, \nif I don't like it, I am not going to allow anybody else to amend it, \nis unacceptable. In an institution known as the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, it brings this body no honor to obstruct the process \nand to try to jam this unacceptable bill down our throats.\n  The current committee bill disqualifies from the legalization program \nany alien who is ineligible for a visa. The Kyl-Cornyn amendment would \nclarify that by saying any alien who is ineligible for a visa or who \nhas been convicted of a felony or three misdemeanors would be \nineligible from the legalization program.\n  There are certain crimes, including felonies, that do not disqualify \nan alien for a visa. This amendment, therefore, ensures that no felon \nor repeat criminal offender will obtain an automatic path to a green \ncard and permanent residence in the United States.\n  This amendment is exactly the same text that was in the 1986 amnesty. \nIn other words, the very amendment Senator Kyl and I have offered to \nexclude felons and three-time misdemeanants was part of the 1986 \namnesty. So the proposal on the floor is even weaker than the amnesty \ngranted in 1986.\n  All we are trying to do is to bring it on a par with that amnesty of \n1986. Crimes that do not automatically disqualify an alien for a visa \nand would not, therefore, be covered by the Judiciary Committee bill \nthat is on the floor include assault and battery, manslaughter, \nkidnapping, weapons possession--for example, possession of a\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\nsawed-off shotgun--contributing to the delinquency of a minor, \nburglary, including possession of tools to commit burglary, malicious \ndestruction of property, possession of stolen property, alien \nsmuggling, conspiracy to commit offenses against the United States, and \nmoney laundering. Unless we are able to get a vote on the amendment \nthat is now pending that Senator Kyl and I have offered to exclude \nfelons and three-time misdemeanants, the proposal this body is asked to \naccept would give amnesty to people who have engaged in alien \nsmuggling, manslaughter, kidnapping, or illegal possession of a sawed-\noff shotgun.\n  The American people will forgive a lot, but they won't be fooled \nagain. And they won't forgive us if a minority of this body tries to \njam down the throats of the rest of the Senate provisions which would \nallow the entry of these individuals into the United States and would \nconfer a blanket amnesty and a path to a green card and legal permanent \nresidency in the United States. It simply defies common sense.\n  I have a number of additional amendments I intend to offer and intend \nto ask for a vote on. I will not be satisfied--and I submit there are \nother Senators who will not vote to close off debate--until we get a \nchance to have these considered on the Senate floor. One amendment, No. \n3310, addresses the confidentiality provisions. The Judiciary Committee \namendment that is on the floor contains provisions that would prohibit \nthe use of information furnished by an applicant to be used for any \npurpose other than a determination on the application. While the \ncommittee amendment would allow the information to be shared with law \nenforcement entities upon their request, the information could not be \nused by the Department of Homeland Security to investigate fraud in the \nprogram.\n  It is also worth noting that these provisions almost word for word \nwere included in the 1986 amnesty but are missing from the proposal \nthat is now on the floor. These confidentiality provisions have been \ncited by Government authorities as one reason why there is so much \nfraud in our immigration system, particularly the amnesty that was \ngranted in 1986.\n  For example, the testimony of Paul Virtue, former Immigration and \nNaturalization Service general counsel, in 1999 before the House \nregarding fraud in the prior amnesty program:\n\n       There is no question that the provisions of [that 1986 \n     amnesty] were subject to widespread abuse, especially the \n     Special Agricultural Worker program that granted agricultural \n     workers who had performed 90 days of qualifying agricultural \n     employment within a specific period temporary lawful status \n     that automatically converted to permanent lawful status after \n     one year.\n       Nearly 1.3 million applications were filed under [this \n     Special Agricultural Worker] status, about double the number \n     of foreign farm workers usually employed in the United States \n     in any given year.\n       Much of the fraud that occurred under the IRCA\n\n--the 1986 amnesty bill--\n\n     is attributable to statutory limitations placed on [the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service].\n       The confidentiality restrictions of law . . . prevented INS \n     from pursuing cases of possible fraud detected during the \n     application process. The agency was further thwarted by the \n     courts, which ruled that INS could not deny an application \n     simply because the supporting documentation was from a \n     claimed employer suspected or convicted of fraud.\n\n  Let me say that again. He said the confidentiality restrictions \ncontained in the underlying bill here that I want to amend thwarted the \nINS from denying an application simply because the supporting \ndocumentation was from an employer ``suspected or convicted of fraud.''\n  In 1986, just a few million amnesty applications were filed, but \nunder this bill, Congress is now considering an amnesty for 12 million \nimmigrants who are in this country in an unauthorized status. We need \nto make sure we don't hamper the Immigration and Naturalization \nService's ability to detect fraud. Yet this amendment would repeat the \nworst failures of that 1986 amnesty.\n  One other amendment I have filed and intend to call up, if we are \never given a chance to have amendments and votes on this bill, is \namendment No. 3309.\n  The committee amendment pending on the floor, which I offer this \namendment to improve, would create safe harbors for illegal aliens who \nhave filed applications for conditional immigration status.\n  To be clear, these are not aliens who have yet established \neligibility, or have even gone through background and security checks. \nThey have simply filed an application with the Government, and their \napplication might be in a stack of 10 million other applications.\n  Under this committee amendment, the one pending on the floor, to be \nclear, the Department of Homeland Security would be required to issue a \ntravel document and an employment authorization document to an alien \nbefore the agency has even determined eligibility under the program. \nTravel documents are as important as weapons. Yet this section would \nrequire the Department of Homeland Security to issue a travel document \nto all illegal aliens simply because they have filed an application.\n  Under the underlying bill, an illegal alien may not be detained, \nordered deported, or removed while the alien has an application \npending. That means any illegal alien can simply file an application to \navoid deportation, and many will, of course, because it could take \nseveral years, and probably will take several years, for the Department \nof Homeland Security to process all applications.\n  Another disturbing point is there are also no carve-outs for criminal \naliens or other dangerous illegal aliens who would normally be subject \nto mandatory detention. This underlying bill could be interpreted as \nnot allowing the Department of Homeland Security to detain any alien, \nirrespective of how dangerous that alien is to society.\n  While the amendment does say an alien may be deported if the alien \n``becomes ineligible,'' that is prospective and it means any illegal \nalien could only be subject to deportation for criminal activity that \noccurs after they filed their application.\n  We should be unwilling to create a significant loophole for criminal \nillegal aliens who could avoid deportation or detention by simply \nfiling an application with the Government.\n  The underlying bill would require the Department of Homeland Security \nto allow any alien apprehended before the program is operational, which \ncould be several years down the road, to apply for amnesty after the \nprogram is up and running. If it does indeed take several years, that \nmeans our immigration enforcement system, which right now apprehends \nmore than a million illegal aliens a year on the southern border, would \ngrind to a halt because any alien who is apprehended could simply file \nan application or indicate an intent to file an application, and the \nGovernment would be required to stop the removal process to allow that \nto occur.\n  Mr. President, I know there are other Senators who wish to speak. I \nam going to stop in a moment to give them that opportunity.\n  My point is there are many commonsense amendments that I believe \nwould garner the support of a majority of the Senate because they are \ncommonsense amendments. But as long as we are blocked from having those \namendments called up and considered and voted on, then there is no way \nthat Members of this body should vote to close off debate, vote for \ncloture, because we will be producing a product that is simply unworthy \nof the trust that has been placed in us by the American people. I \nbelieve that no individual Senator and, indeed, no leader of either \nparty should be allowed to refuse to allow this process to move \nforward. I think what is going to happen, because I think we are on a \npath toward failure--at least between now and Friday--and what we are \ngoing to see is the blame game.\n  There is going to be an attempt by those who have blocked this \nprocess from going forward to point the finger of blame at those who \nhave voted against ending the debate because we cannot get a vote on \nour amendments. I want to make it clear where the fault lies. That \nblame should be squarely placed at the feet of the Democratic leader, \nwho has denied us an opportunity to have a vote on these commonsense \namendments--amendments that I believe the American people would agree \nwith and, if given an opportunity, I believe the Senate would agree \nwith.\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. We are on the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened with some interest to my \ncolleague. I have to observe, though, he said that now we are going to \nsee the blame game, and he tells us where the fault lies. Well, that is \nthe first chapter of the blame game. I have not been out here with \nrespect to amendments. I have been chairing a hearing for a couple of \nhours. But I say this to those who are talking about these amendments: \nThose of us on this side of the aisle have certainly had a great deal \nof experience with having our amendments not considered by the Senate. \nMost recently, we had an amendment to a bill that would have dealt with \nthis issue of the Dubai company taking over American ports. The United \nArab Emirates' wholly-owned company, Dubai Ports World, was going to \ntake over the management of American shipping ports. We attempted to \noffer an amendment, but it shut the Senate down because the majority \nparty didn't want an amendment such as that offered.\n  I have been trying for a couple of years to offer an amendment on the \nreimportation of prescription drugs to drive down prescription drug \nprices in this country. We have been thwarted on that. I could go on at \nsome great length. To the extent there is a complaint that some have \nnot been able to offer amendments, we understand that pretty well. We \nhave been in that position for a couple of years now, including my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, who offered an amendment that \nwould have effectively prohibited our country from engaging in torture \nwith respect to those whom we have apprehended during wartime. That \namendment on the prohibition of torture shut down the consideration of \nthe Defense authorization bill last year month after month because the \nmajority didn't want to vote on the McCain amendment on torture. So \nthere is plenty of practice that has existed in this Chamber for \nprohibiting amendments.\n  Again, I don't know what the approach has been this morning on the \nfloor because I have not been here. When I listen to discussions about \nwhy can we not offer amendments, that is a cry that has been echoing in \nthis Chamber for a couple of years, much to the regret of those of us \nwho have had amendments to offer. It is a cry that has not been heard \nby the majority party, which now jumps to the front of the line to \ncomplain today.\n  I want to talk about this issue of the underlying bill, the \nimmigration bill and guest workers. I should also start by saying I \ndon't have any particular claim to understanding or expertise in this \narea. I don't serve on the Judiciary Committee. I was not someone who \nhelped write the underlying bill. So I don't come to the floor to claim \nto be an expert on the legislation. But I have spent a great deal of \ntime in the last year or so doing research in a range of areas for a \nwriting project dealing with American jobs and American workers, so I \nclaim to know something about that.\n  I claim to know, for example, that we have lost somewhere around 3 \nmillion-plus jobs in this country, most of them having moved to China \nor Indonesia or Bangladesh or Sri Lanka--but most perhaps to China. We \nhave lost millions of jobs in this country in the last 3\\1/2\\ to 4 \nyears. American workers, middle-income workers, and particularly \nworkers at the bottom of the economic ladder, have been devastated by \nwhat has happened with this race toward globalization and the race by \nthe largest American corporations to produce where it is cheap, and \nthen sell their products in our marketplace. All of that is going on in \na very accelerated way.\n  Now we see, with the bill brought to the floor of the Senate, not \nonly do we have a strategy in this country of allowing the export of \ngood American jobs, now we will have a strategy of importing additional \nlow-wage jobs.\n  I will review some numbers, if I might. We have somewhere around 11 \nmillion to 12 million people who have come into this country illegally \nand have stayed here. Some have been here a long while, and some \nrecently arrived.\n  Is it surprising that we have a lot of people who have come into this \ncountry and stayed in violation of the law? No, it is not surprising to \nme. We live in a big world, and a lot of people in this world don't \nhave the opportunities we have in this country. We have built something \nvery special in the United States. This is a country that provides \nbasic rights for people. It took us some while to perfect all that, but \nhaving struggled through the issues of civil rights, workers' rights, \nand women's rights, we have created an extraordinary country in which \nworkers can band together to collectively bargain and negotiate. We \nhave made decisions about the workplace and the right of a worker to \nwork in a safe workplace, child labor laws, minimum wages, \nenvironmental protection, so you cannot produce a product and emit \npoisonous chemicals into the air and water.\n  At the same time, we have created circumstances where businesses can \nearn a profit, and a good one. This is an economy in which we have a \nvast consumer base, with the most affluent consumers in the world. All \nof that coming together created a country that is unparalleled on the \nface of this planet. So if you go anywhere in the world, and \nparticularly impoverished areas in less developed countries, you will \nfind, in discussing this with those people, that many would say they \nwant to come to the United States of America. If you ask the question \n``why,'' they will say it is because there is opportunity there, jobs \nthere, better income, better pay. That is what you find. I have found \nthat in many parts of the world, particularly in less developed \ncountries.\n  Think for a moment what would be the case if tomorrow the United \nStates said: Look, what we have built here is quite wonderful. We \nunderstand it is unique and we want to share it with everyone. We have \nno immigration quotas and anybody who wishes to come here can come. \nTomorrow, you are all welcome. Come and stay as long as you want.\n  What would be the consequences of that? We all know the consequences \nof that. Those who are living in impoverished conditions from other \nparts of the world will find their way to this country. We will be \nimporting poverty and we will have a massive number of people migrating \nto the United States of America, because they would see this as an \nopportunity. So we don't have a circumstance where we say that anybody \nwho wants to come tomorrow, come on, this is wide open, and stay as \nlong as you want. No. We have a series of quotas for immigrants. We \nhave immigration quotas by country, by category, and then we allow \npeople in based on these quotas.\n  I will describe exactly what we now face. We have 11 million to 12 \nmillion people who are here illegally. Last year, according to data I \nhave seen, 1.1 million additional people tried to cross the border from \nMexico into this country, but they were denied access. So 1.1 million \nwere kept out who wanted to come in. And 400,000 to 700,000 who wanted \nin illegally got in illegally and are here. They came last year. \nAnother roughly 150,000 people--according to estimates I have seen--are \nhere on a temporary basis, H-2A or H-2B. Another 175,000 people came in \nlast year legally, as family members and quotas, just from Mexico. That \nis what we face.\n  Now, at the same time we face these pressures of people wanting to \ncome into our country, particularly in most cases low-skilled and low-\nwage workers, we face the largest trade deficits in the history of the \nworld. We face the wholesale movement of American jobs overseas. So we \nsee the two elements of the worst marriage of public policy; those are \nthe export of good American jobs to China and elsewhere, and the import \nof low-wage workers to take the jobs of those in this country who are \nat the bottom of the economic ladder. That is about corporations, big \ncompanies, about their strategy, which has been embraced and given a \nbear hug by this President and the Congress, controlled by the \nPresident's party, standing for corporations and their interests. \nExport American jobs, do another trade deal, cause more American jobs \nto leave this country. Import cheap labor.\n  Why? They say: We want to import more cheap labor because we cannot\n\n[[Page S2876]]\n\nfind Americans to do the work. So not only does the bill on the floor \nof the Senate describe that we will create a legal status for 11 \nmillion to 12 million people who are here because, practically \nspeaking, nobody is going to round them up, or arrest them, or detain \nthem, or export them--we will create a status for those folks--but in \naddition to that, it says let's also create a new guest worker program \nof 400,000 people per year each year, with an escalator of being able \nto increase that by 20 percent each year, which over 6 years could \namount to 4.7 million more people coming into this country who now live \noutside of this country.\n  And so the bill provides a guest worker program saying we not only \nwant to deal with the legalization of those who are here illegally--\nmillions and millions and millions of them--we also want to add \npotentially another 4.7 million. And, by the way, there is more than \nthat, but that is just the piece about which I am talking. On top of \nthat would be the provisions dealing with the new agricultural workers, \nwhich was an amendment offered in the committee.\n  So where do these 4.7 million people go--the ones who are now living \noutside of our country who come into our country legally--under this \nlegislation? They go to find jobs in competition with American workers.\n  Let's talk about low-skilled, low-wage American workers.\n  This Congress, as stingy as it has been for low-wage, low-skilled \nworkers, has decided for 8 years it will not increase the minimum wage. \nBoy, it is Katy bar the door if it comes to helping somebody at the \ntop--tax breaks, unbelievable tax breaks for people at the top.\n  One of the world's richest people told me the other day when I was \ntalking with him that he pays a lower income tax rate than the \nreceptionist in his office. Why? Because the priority in this Chamber, \nthe priority in this Congress, the priority of the President, is to \ndrive down income tax rates for people who have capital gains. Who has \ncapital gains? The wealthy. They have most of the capital gains. The \nwealthiest Americans are now paying the lowest tax rates, and this \nCongress can't be quick enough to see if they can't offer another gift \nto those at the top of the income scale.\n  I have nothing at all against those at the top of the income ladder. \nGod bless them, that is what America is about; it is about success. But \nthat does not justify saying that those who are the most successful \nshall pay the lowest income tax rates in our country, and that is what \nis happening. At the same time, Congress can't move quickly enough to \nprovide the lowest tax rates to those with the highest incomes. It says \nto the people with the lowest incomes: We don't have any interest in \nincreasing the minimum wage. Sit there for 8 years, let inflation work \nagainst your purchasing power; doesn't matter to us, we don't intend to \nincrease it. I think that is a terrible mistake, but that is the way \npeople at the bottom of the economic ladder have been treated in this \ncountry now for many years.\n  Now they will be treated again to the prospect of saying: Let's have \nsome more people come in; let's not just deal with this 11 to 12 \nmillion, let's have more people come in on top of that because we can't \nfind Americans to do that work.\n  Why can't we find Americans to do that work? Let me read something \nfrom Robert Samuelson, a Washington Post editorial. I fully agree with \nthis. He talks about:\n\n       It's a myth that the U.S. economy ``needs'' more poor \n     immigrants.\n\n  He is speaking especially of the guest worker provisions.\n\n       The illegal immigrants already here represent only about \n     4.9 percent of the current labor force, reports the Pew \n     Hispanic Center. In no major occupation are they a major-\n     ity. . . .\n       Hardly anyone thinks that most existing illegal immigrants \n     will leave--\n\n  Or be rounded up, arrested, or deported. I understand that. I think \nall of us probably understand that. I think there should be some \nenforcement of employer sanctions which we created but have not \nenforced, which would make a big difference with respect to illegal \nimmigration. Here is what Samuelson said:\n\n       In 2004, the median hourly wage in Mexico was $1.86 \n     compared to $9 for Mexicans working in the United States, \n     says Rakesh Kochhar of Pew. With high labor turnover in the \n     jobs they take, most new illegal immigrants can get work by \n     accepting wages slightly below prevailing levels. . . .\n       But what would happen if new illegal immigration stopped \n     and wasn't replaced by these guest workers?\n\n  That is an assumption. First, I don't buy the assumption that even if \nthis bill is passed with legalizing 11 to 12 million immigrants and \nthen allowing up to 4.7 million new people to come in who are now \nliving outside our country, I don't buy the notion that we have plugged \nthe border. I don't think we in any way inhibit illegal immigrants from \ncoming across the border. I know my colleagues are talking about \ntightening the border and employer sanctions, and I will talk about \nthat in a minute. Employer sanctions was the 1986 Simpson-Mazzoli bill. \nThat was a miserable failure, and I will explain why.\n  Again quoting Samuelson:\n\n       But what would happen if new illegal immigration stopped \n     and wasn't replaced by guest workers?\n\n  At some point higher wages would be going to American workers.\n\n       President Bush says that his guest worker program would \n     ``match willing foreign workers with willing American \n     employers, when no Americans can be found to fill the jobs.'' \n     But at some higher wage, there would be willing Americans.\n\n  As long as you can bring illegal immigrants, which is what has been \nhappening, into the country and they can work in the shadows and \nemployers can employ them for subminimum wage, I understand why \nemployers would not be employing American workers because they have a \nsteady stream of workers they can employ below the minimum wage.\n\n       Business organizations understandably support guest worker \n     programs. They like cheap labor and ignore the social \n     consequences.\n\n  That is what is at work here. What is at work here is the same \ncorporate interests who are exporting good American jobs are supporting \nthis bill because they cannot only export good American jobs on the \nproduction side, but for those jobs you can't export, you can import \ncheap labor. And that is what this is about: Export good jobs and \nimport cheap labor.\n\n  Let me talk for a moment about the debate over the Simpson-Mazzoli \nbill two decades ago at a time when we were told we had a significant \nimmigration problem. That was a bill about border enforcement, \nstrengthening enforcement at the border, and also creating employer \nsanctions.\n  The purpose of that bill was to say to employers: Don't you dare hire \nillegal immigrants; if you are hiring workers who are illegal, you are \ngoing to be in trouble, you are going to be slapped with a fine and \nsubject to enforcement actions. So I went back and read the 1985 and \n1986 debate about Simpson-Mazzoli. I won't embarrass anybody by reading \nit on the floor of the Senate. It was fascinating debate in the House \nand the Senate. This was nirvana. This was the entire solution. It was \ngoing to work like a charm because if you say to employers you dare not \nhire people who are not here legally, you shut down the job, you shut \ndown the magnet, you shut down illegal immigration, end of story.\n  The fact is it didn't work at all. We have people in my State, the \nState of North Dakota, today--in fact, I think there is a story in \ntoday's paper about illegal immigrants working on some energy plants in \nthe middle of North Dakota, found to be illegal. The question is: Is \nanybody going to take action against the employer? That would be a \nMinnesota employer, by the way.\n  Most of our troubles come from Minnesota. We joke about that.\n  If a Minnesota employer hires illegal workers, and he is caught, are \nthere any problems for the Minnesota employer? No, no, not even a slap \non the wrist; just a pat on the back. Nobody is going to prosecute. \nNobody is going to fine them. Nobody is going to take enforcement \naction. It is exactly why we are in the situation we are in today. \nThere are no sanctions for employers who hire illegal aliens.\n  I want to say very clearly that I don't in any way, because I oppose \nthis guest worker program that will bring 4.7 million people in to \ncompete with American workers at the bottom of the economic ladder, I \ndon't in any way want to diminish the dignity and self-\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nworth of immigrants. I don't mean that at all. I know in most cases \nthese are hard-working people, good families. Most of us have come from \nimmigrant families at some point in our lineage. Because someone would \ncome out and say, as I do today, that I don't support this proposal \noffered by the President and offered on the floor of the Senate, saying \nnot only are we going to legalize or give legal status to 11 or 12 \nmillion people who came here illegally, but in addition to that, we are \ngoing to allow 400,000 people a year with a 20-percent escalation \nclause for the 4.7 million additional people potentially in 6 years to \ncome into this country, I am not going to support that. That is a \nstrategy for corporations to provide a ladder of cheap labor coming \ninto this country, displacing American workers.\n  We have a serious crisis in this country with respect to the plight \nof America's workers. A lot of people who worked hard all their lives, \nworked for companies and were proud of it are now discovering their \njobs are not safe, their jobs are not secure. In many cases, their jobs \nare gone--gone to China, gone to Indonesia. Yes, they can find another \njob. The statistics show they find another job at 20 percent less \nincome. In most cases, they have lost their pensions; they have lost \ntheir health care. These are middle-income American workers, and the \nlow-income workers, the people at the bottom of the ladder, the people \nwho are high school dropouts, they work hard, they struggle, and now \nwhat they have confronted in recent years is a corporate strategy of \nbeing able to hire illegal immigrants at subpar wages, so the jobs are \nnot there for them.\n  We have a lot of people come to this floor and want to offer \namendments. They say they speak for this immigration bill, and they say \nthey speak for immigrants. Again, let me emphasize, I don't want to \ndiminish their concern for immigrant families. I don't want to do that. \nThat is not what I am about. But I want to come to this floor to say a \nword on behalf of American workers because nobody is coming to this \nfloor to talk about American workers, American jobs, and what it means \nto our country's future to have good jobs that pay well with retirement \nbenefits and health benefits.\n  The current strategy we are employing in this country today, a \nstrategy embraced by this President and this Congress, a corporate \nstrategy that says let us export good jobs and import cheap labor, that \nis a strategy that undermines our economy.\n  I am interested in the long-term economic health of this country. We \nhave a lot of kids who will grow up in this country, American kids, who \nwant opportunity. Every single set of parents wants to leave a country \nthat is better for their children. They want to leave a country that \nprovides more opportunities for their children, and that is simply not \nthe case these days, regrettably. It is because we have an economic \nstrategy that is off track, and we need to put it on track. I have \nideas about how to do that. Others do as well. But one of those ideas \nwould not include suggesting that we ought to displace American workers \nwith 4.7 million additional immigrant workers who now live outside of \nour country but who will come into our country to assume low-wage jobs \nand displace jobs for low-wage American workers. That would not be \nincluded in my suggestion of how to fix what is wrong in our country.\n  There is so much to say about this subject. I know there is great \npassion. I have heard it from all of the groups. I have used a lot of \nstatistics. This is not, after all, about statistics or data. It is \nabout hopes and dreams and aspirations. It is about human misery. It is \nabout living in the shadows. It is about all of those things. So I \nunderstand the passion that exists on the floor of this Senate about \nthis matter. But I also, as one Member of this body, lament that there \nseems to be so little effort and so little activity on this floor about \nthe passions and the hopes and the dreams and the inspiration American \nworkers have about their future.\n  I have indicated previously, I know we have this global economy and I \nknow part of that global economy plays a role in this immigration \ndebate. People say you are a hopeless xenophobe who doesn't get it. We \nall see over the horizon, and you somehow are nearsighted. My sense is \nthat we as a country will have our better days ahead of us if we adopt \npublic policy which is thoughtful and, yes, which has as a self-\ninterest the long-term economic well-being of our country.\n\n  But this global economy has marched and now galloped forward without \nadequate rules with respect to jobs and income and opportunity in this \ncountry, and too few people seem to care about the diminished \ncircumstances facing most American families and most American workers. \nThat, too, should play a central role in this discussion. That, too, \nshould be a part of the consideration here in the Senate. Regrettably, \nit has not been. My hope is that perhaps in the next 48 hours it will \nbe, finally.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader be recognized at 3:15 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I take offense at the characterizations of \nthe Democratic leader about obstructing this legislation, particularly \nfrom those from southern border States who, in addition to the \nculpability of the Federal Government, should take the blame for some \nof the failures of these last few years that have perpetrated these 11 \nmillion, 12 million illegal immigrants upon the United States. I \nrespect the comments of the Senator from North Dakota, putting those \nresponsibilities, some of them, on the businesses of Minnesota, but I \nmust say that the businesses of Minnesota and perhaps other Northern \nStates have, to their credit, resisted the imposition of workers from \nother countries upon themselves--again, to their credit. It is from the \nStates of southern borders, those businesses which have allowed this \nillegal immigration to go unchecked and which have, I believe to their \ndiscredit, employed these individuals.\n  It surprises me--in fact, I would call it the rank hypocrisy of those \nwho have stood here today representing these States whose businesses \nhave allowed these illegal immigrants to be employed, who have \nbenefited and profited from those employments, and who now are suddenly \ntrying to take aggressive action to impose these sanctions upon all \nbusinesses. I believe strongly that Minnesota businesses and others in \nNorthern States have been forced to accept illegal immigrants because \nof the failure of States on the southern border to stand up and to \nprotect their borders, in addition to the Federal Government. I deeply \nobject to those who are claiming that somehow that is the failure of \nNorthern States such as Minnesota.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside and that my amendment No. 3232 be called \nup.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I am disappointed that my colleagues \nacross the aisle will not let those of us who have good faith \namendments to call them up, debate them, and have a vote on them. This \nis most troubling\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\nbecause, while I disagree with many of the provisions in the bill, the \nborder security provisions are absolutely critical. The majority of \nAmericans consider border security to be one of the most important \npriorities considered by Congress. In holding up the amendment process, \nthe Democrats are holding up the chance to move forward on these \ncritical border security issues. This legislation is too important to \nfall victim to politics as usual.\n  As I said, I strongly disagree with this legislation in its current \nform. I think the provisions relative to agriculture are not in the \nbest interests of farmers and agribusiness people. I can't tell you how \nmany phone calls and letters and emails I have received from my \nconstituents in Georgia as well as from farmers across the Nation \nvoicing their objection to many pieces of the Judiciary Committee bill \nand encouraging me in my efforts to make some important changes.\n  So I was astounded to hear the minority leader yesterday suggest that \nthe Judiciary Committee's bill is good enough for him and therefore \nshould be accepted whole hog by the Senate. That is not the way the \nSenate works. This body is based on the concept of debate. To suggest \nthat this legislation should reflect the will of the 18 members of \nJudiciary Committee and ignore the will of the full Senate is to \nbelittle the enormous implications that will result from whatever \nlegislation the Senate passes.\n  I recognize that a number of pending amendments are going to require \nthe Senate to make some difficult votes. But we cannot try to avoid \nthese votes for political expediency. The American people deserve to \nknow where their Senators stand on these critical issues. And every \nSenator has the right to try to shape this legislation.\n  The folks on the other side of the aisle need to stop playing \npolitics as usual--which is obstruct, obstruct, obstruct. This bill is \ntoo important and their antics are going to prevent us from having a \nbill that actually means something and isn't just a repeat of the past. \nGeorgians and the American people deserve more than politics as usual--\nthey deserve a thoughtful and thorough debate.\n  Even though I am not allowed to offer my amendment at this time, I \nwould like to take a few moments to speak about it. And at this point I \nwould like to ask unanimous consent that Senator Brownback be added as \na cosponsor to amendment No. 3232.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the Judiciary substitute bill mandates \nthat the minimum wage that must be paid to workers admitted under the \nH-2A program shall be the greater of: the applicable state minimum \nwage, the prevailing wage, or the adverse effect wage rate, often \nreferred to as the AEWR. In almost every case in every State, the AEWR \nis significantly higher than the local prevailing wage. Interestingly \nenough, the U.S. Department of Labor does not determine this AEWR. AEWR \nwages are based solely on a U.S. Department of Agriculture's National \nAgriculture Statistics Service quarterly survey--a survey that has been \npublished by the Department of Agriculture for decades; a survey that \nwas never intended for the purpose for which the Department of Labor \nutilizes the collected data.\n  The AEWR reflects the average wage for disparate field and livestock \nwork over a multistate area. Packing house work--an occupation filled \nby a large number of H2-A workers--is not surveyed. The NASS survey \nresult is the average of all agricultural wages, including the wages \nthat are paid to workers whose higher production levels entitle them to \nadditional incentives or piecework pay. The U.S. Department of Labor \nthen uses this average wage without regard for differences in \noccupations, skills and seasonality by turning that average into a \nminimum guaranteed wage for purposes of the AEWR.\n  To put this in terms my colleagues can understand, this would be like \nif you took a survey of all congressional salaries, from Senators and \nCongressmen to staff assistants, and then took the average of those \nsalaries and mandated that the average wage must be the minimum amount \npaid to any congressional staffer.\n  Agricultural employers who use the H-2A program to avoid breaking the \nlaw by hiring legal workers are put at a distinct competitive \ndisadvantage when compared to growers who use the available \nundocumented workforce. In fact, this competitive disadvantage caused \nby the additional expense of using H-2A is a major factor in the \nagricultural industry's increasing dependency on an illegal workforce.\n  Those employers who have been utilizing an illegal workforce have not \nbeen paying those illegal workers anywhere near the adverse effect wage \nrate. Most troubling to me is that in the Judiciary Committee's bill, \nonce agricultural employers transition those illegal workers to blue \ncard workers, there is still no mandated wage floor for them! \nTherefore, H-2A growers will continue to experience unfair competition \nif the AEWR is not replaced with local prevailing wages.\n  I would also like to point out that the wages required of employers \nof workers admitted under every other temporary, non-immigrant visa \ncategory is a local prevailing wage rate determined by the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor through specific occupational surveys by the \nvarious states.\n  I believe this should be the case for the H-2A program as well. \nMoving from an Adverse Effect Wage Rate requirement to a prevailing \nwage would allow the use of a more localized, occupation-specific, \ncompetitive wage when growers access legal workers through the H-2A \nprogram. This would naturally raise wages for some farm workers and \nbetter reflect the economic realities of the area in which the work is \nperformed and the type of work being performed. It would also encourage \nagricultural employers to participate in a program designed to protect \nand identify the workers on our Nation's farms.\n  I urge you to support the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I will sound, unfortunately, \nlike a broken record for the next 15 minutes or so.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I will object to an amendment being called up at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has been recognized. \nThe quorum call has been lifted. No other unanimous consent request has \nbeen made.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. It is important to stress again and again we \nmust focus on border security first.\n  When I first announced and then introduced my border security bill \nlast fall along with my colleagues, Senator Sessions and Senator \nCoburn, people across America were talking about securing our borders \nbut there wasn't any action.\n  No bill in Congress was moving because most of the efforts tried to \ntackle everything and ended up doing nothing.\n  I proposed changing the way we address immigration reform and \nintroduced a bipartisan bill that focuses on border security first.\n  Until we secure our borders, the U.S. will never be able to control \nthe deeper problems of illegal immigration. I repeat: without securing \nour borders first, the U.S. will never be able to deal with its illegal \nimmigration problems.\n  That is why, I, along with my colleagues Senator Sessions, Senator \nByrd, and Senator Vitter are offering our bipartisan border security \nbill as a complete substitute to the bill that Senator Specter and the \nJudiciary Committee have offered.\n  We all have great respect for Senator Specter and the hard work by \nthe Judiciary Committee to complete the bill they reported out last \nweek under difficult time constraints. It is a good thing that we have \nso many people working together trying to find solutions to our illegal \nimmigration problem. But it is important that those efforts are not \nlost because we tried to tackle everything and accomplished nothing. \nThose efforts are why we must focus on border security.\n  My colleagues and I are convinced that there is only one way we are \ngoing\n\n[[Page S2879]]\n\nto find consensus and see real action this year, and that is if we take \nthe very important step of securing our borders first.\n  Our proposal would add 3,000 border patrol agents per year for 5 \nyears and enhance border security technology.\n  It also adds:\n  1,000 new investigative personnel dedicated to stopping immigrant \nsmuggling;\n  10,000 new Department of Homeland Security investigators dedicated to \nworksite enforcement; and\n  15,000 immigration enforcement agents dedicated to fraud detection.\n  At the same time, we give employers the tools they need to confirm \nthe status of prospective employees to ensure that they are following \nthe law.\n  If the companies have completed the verification process they will be \nprotected in their hiring decisions. And the companies will not need to \nbe concerned with verifying documents nor will they have to be in the \nbusiness of making sure that documents handed to them are not \nfraudulent. However, if a company ignores this process and hires \nillegal immigrants anyway, our proposal enhances the penalties for \nbreaking the law.\n  We believe that this is an important component for securing our \nborders and addressing the problem of illegal immigration. By removing \nthe motivation behind most illegal immigration--securing employment \nthrough fraudulent documents or unscrupulous employers--we can take \nanother important step towards resolving our illegal immigration \nproblems.\n  In addition to aiding employers identifying illegal immigrants, this \nproposal also helps border security agents to stop immigrant smuggling, \nhuman trafficking, and other border offenses. This will ensure that \ngangs, organized crime, and individuals looking to exploit illegal \nimmigrants for profit are prosecuted and prevented from putting \nimmigrants in harms way.\n  Currently, these offenders are difficult to prosecute and are soon \nback committing new offenses of the same old crime.\n  I understand there has been some confusion about who this provision \nof the Border Security First proposal targets. I would like to set the \nrecord straight and make absolutely clear that this section is not \naimed at prosecuting any religious or humanitarian groups that assist \nindividuals in need. These people are not prosecuted now nor will they \nbe in the future--nor should they be.\n  Instead, we need to stop the criminals who are smuggling people for \nfinancial gain and commercial profit. They are the ones hurting \nimmigrants, not our religious and nonprofit groups.\n  I would also like to clarify for the record that this proposal does \nnot make illegal immigrants in this country felons. It merely seeks to \nsecure our borders as a first step towards resolving our illegal \nimmigration problems.\n  I continue to push for border security first because I believe that \nit is our responsibility to work together to find a solution to this \nproblem confronting our Nation. Our fellow Americans expect no less \nfrom us.\n  I continue to push for border security first because it makes common \nsense.\n  We all agree that the borders need to be secured.\n  And with a problem as pressing as illegal immigration, it is \nimportant that we work to build a consensus and that we concentrate our \nefforts on getting something accomplished that moves us along the path \ntowards resolving this problem.\n  The disagreements we face all stem from the additional problem of \nwhat to do with the illegal immigrants already here. I am for securing \nthe border first--and then developing a plan for the illegal immigrants \nalready here. We cannot afford to miss this opportunity to begin \nsolving this problem because we concentrated on the things we disagree \nabout rather than working to make sure we accomplished what we all \nagree needs to be accomplished first.\n  Unless we secure our borders first, the problem will only continue to \nworsen and the number of illegal immigrants we need to address will be \nlarger than it is now.\n  Unless we secure our borders first, the U.S. will never have a firm \ngrasp on the interior problems we have as a result of illegal \nimmigration.\n  Unless we secure our borders first, we will never be able to \nadequately address the remaining issues that illegal immigration \npresent.\n  Unless we secure our borders first, we will miss this opportunity to \nbegin solving a problem and we will have failed to properly do our jobs \nfor the American people.\n  By implementing tough new changes to secure our borders we can take \nan important first step toward addressing illegal immigration.\n  Today as we continue this debate and we continue to think about the \nbill that is before the Senate, we need to redirect our attention and \nput border security first so we can then go on. The ``do everything'' \nbill that is before the Senate today will end up doing nothing. The \nreason is if it is passed by this Senate and goes to the conference \ncommittee, it cannot be squared with the House version that has already \nbeen passed. It will be easier to square the circle than it will be to \nbring these two disparate bills together, and that is why we need to do \nsomething to secure our borders first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I come to the floor, and I am broadly \nsupported by our caucus, because we come to a moment in time where \npeople are looking at the Senate, America is looking at the Senate, and \nasking: Why? Why are we at a point where we are addressed with a \nproblem that is not insurmountable--seemingly insurmountable at times \nbut a problem which can be addressed, which addresses the issues that \nare so fundamental to our country--issues of national security, issues \nof fairness, issues of compassion--challenges that if not addressed \nwill continue to grow, thereby threatening the security of the American \npeople, who are watching.\n  Republicans are here--we see it right here on the floor right now--\nand we have been here since last Wednesday on a bill doing what the \nAmerican people expect; that is, identifying a problem, discussing a \nproblem, putting together amendments in order to take a bill to the \nfloor and, therefore, improve a bill. And yet we are being denied that \nbasic opportunity.\n  Right this very moment, we are here to address a national problem, a \nproblem that is pressing. It impacts every American listening. I \nmentioned the word ``fairness'' because it is basically a matter of \nfairness--of fairness to a group of people, the 12 million undocumented \npeople here in this country today, who, yes, came here illegally, but \nwho are listening and watching right now and asking that question, Will \nmy plight be addressed and addressed appropriately?\n  It has to do with fairness to the Senate, where each of us came here \nprobably for different reasons, but to participate in governing and \nmoving America forward to a future that we know will be safer, that \nwill be healthier, that will be more prosperous; and fairness for our \nconstituents, who are scratching their heads right now, at first maybe \nsaying, well, there it is, the Senate, once again, not able to address \nproblems, but then, after a moment, saying that is wrong; those are the \npeople who are sent to Washington to represent us, to address the \ntoughest, most fundamental problems that are out there today, and that \nis our secureness, our security, to address issues that affect internal \nenforcement of the laws of the land, a nation of laws, and, yes, a \nnation that has captured the richness of our immigrants.\n  Twelve million people are living in the shadows. I would argue that \ntoday our Democratic colleagues are living in the shadows by not \nstanding up and addressing the problems, the challenges, the \nopportunities that have been identified. The minority refuses to vote. \nThey refuse to give us simple votes, up-or-down votes, on issues we can \ndebate on the floor, that we are ready to debate.\n  The other side of the aisle is refusing to govern. That is why we \ncame to the Senate. They refuse to come to the\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\ntable to even attempt to address the problem. They are willing to let \nthese 12 million people continue to struggle. They are willing to let \nour national security, by not addressing the problem, be compromised. \nThey are willing to let our health care, our education, and our \nimmigration system be crippled.\n  I come to the floor to make the statement that the immigration system \nis broken, and yet the Democrats today do not have the courage to \naddress the problem, to fix the problem. They show a lack of courage, I \nthink, conviction, and leadership to fix the problem. You fix the \nproblem by doing something, not coming with a solution and saying: This \nis it; take it or leave it. It is to allow us to have an amendment \nproposed, to debate that amendment, and then to vote on that amendment.\n  What happens, then, when we take an issue that is totally \nnonpartisan--it is not a red State, blue State, liberal, conservative, \nDemocratic or Republican issue--and all of a sudden politics gets \ninjected into it? Thus I ask the other side of the aisle to please put \nthe politics aside and allow this body--100 individuals--to cast votes, \ntake up amendments and vote on them.\n  There have been a lot of media reports saying that caucuses are \nfractured--our caucus is fractured and the Democratic caucus is \nfractured. I think that in many ways can be overplayed, but it does \nreflect the fact--not the fracturing but the diversity of ideas, good \nideas, that need to come to the floor and be debated in order to solve \nthese huge problems that are out there: on the border, first and \nforemost; interior enforcement at the workplace; the temporary workers, \nthe 12 million people.\n  We have ideas right here. There are 50 different people with a bunch \nof ideas, yet not one is being allowed to come to the floor, lay down \ntheir amendment, have the manager take up the amendment, debate it, and \nthen vote on that amendment. And we are not going to all agree. That is \nwhat the Senate is all about: to debate, to deliberate, to discuss, and \nthen to act.\n  I think our side has shown our courage to come forth and address a \nproblem. There are not clear-cut answers and not answers everybody is \ngoing to agree with. But by working together--not Republican and \nDemocrat, but by working together, each of us operating with our own \nconvictions, allowed to vote with our own convictions, we can move this \nprocess forward.\n  It comes back to fairness again. It is the fairness for each of us. \nIt is the fairness for the 12 million. It is the fairness for the \nimmigrants who want to come to this country, yes, legally so they will \nhave a clearly defined system.\n  I want to thank the members of my caucus for coming to the table. It \nis a tough issue, the whole immigration issue. It is a broken system. \nIt demands to be fixed. They are ready to fix it, but right now the \nother side of the aisle is not allowing us. Without fail, all of our \npeople have come forward with good ideas. We do not all agree with each \nother--but to work together in a constructive way, bringing out the \nvery best of this body, when, I would argue, over the last 24 hours we \nhave seen the absolute worst.\n  I do believe the American people deserve better. And again, as I \nopened, I said the American people have to be scratching their head. \nNow I used to say this is another insufferable attempt of the other \nside to block, to obstruct, to postpone, to delay, but now I think it \nis beyond that.\n  We know the American people care passionately about this issue. It is \ntime for us to come together--not Republican versus Democrat--and allow \nthese amendments, in an orderly way, determined by the managers, to be \ndebated and voted upon so we can move this country forward, where we \nknow if we act we will be safer, we will give hope where there is no \nhope today, we will respond with compassion, because I have confidence \nin the system itself.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, my questions to the majority leader are \nwhether the conduct of the Democrats is consistent with the usual \npractice of the Senate, which allows Senators to offer, at a minimum, \ngermane amendments to pending legislation, and whether the position \ntaken by the distinguished Democratic leader is consistent with the \npractices and protocol of the Senate?\n  His approach was summarized in a news conference yesterday that I \nspoke about on the Senate floor--I had a minor confrontation with the \nDemocratic leader yesterday--where a question was posed by a reporter. \nQuote:\n\n       Senator Reid, the Republicans are saying that you are not \n     allowing amendments to be voted on on the floor. Is there a \n     reason for that?\n\n  And Senator Reid responded, and I quote:\n\n       We are happy to take a look at amendments that don't damage \n     the integrity of the bill, but if it is going to be, in the \n     estimation of the unified Democrats, an effort to denigrate \n     this bipartisan bill, then they won't have votes on those \n     amendments.\n\n  My question is, is it up to a Senator or a caucus or a party or the \nMembers on one side of the aisle to take a look at the amendments and \ndecide whether they damage the integrity of the bill and to set a \nstandard that if an amendment is going to be, in the estimation of the \nunified Democrats, an effort to denigrate this bipartisan bill, then \nthey won't have a vote on that amendment? Or is it the practice and \nprotocol of the Senate to allow Senators to vote for amendments as \nindividual Senators see the situation in their own right?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in response to my colleague and the manager \nof this bill, it is clear that by protocol, precedent--and I would even \ntake it back to something more basic than that--and simple fairness and \nrespect for individual Members, Members be allowed to come forward and \noffer their amendments and then, yes, discuss it with the Democratic \nleader, the Republican leader, and especially the managers of the bill. \nBut to think that the minority party can cherry-pick which amendments \nwill be considered and no other amendments will be considered is \ntotally outside of the realm of both practice, protocol and, again, \nfairness of the body itself.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished majority leader for a very \npoignant, accurate, conclusive response.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just hope that my friends on the other \nside of the aisle--and there isn't a single Senator over there I don't \nconsider a friend and have great respect for--I hope they remember this \nexchange between the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the \nmajority leader today, as we wind down this session of this Congress. I \nwant them to remember this because you don't have to have a very long \nmemory to understand what has happened in the Senate with our inability \nto offer amendments. The most recent that I can think of, of course, \nwas the Dubai Ports situation on lobbying. The next thing I can go back \nand look at is the PATRIOT Act, where the distinguished majority leader \nfilled the tree.\n  There is no need--we went through this yesterday. There is no need to \ndo this. But the Senate, in the 200-plus years it has been in \nexistence--even though the rules are somewhat difficult to accept, they \nare here. And they are here for a reason. Because over the generations \nof the Senate, there is always the ability to have an endgame. There is \na way to proceed orderly on a piece of legislation. And what we should \ndo on this, if everyone is so upset with what is taking place here, is \nin the morning we will have an opportunity to invoke cloture. All \ngermane amendments will be allowed, if they were filed before 1 o'clock \ntoday. There would be an opportunity then to debate these amendments \nand vote on them. So there is no more orderly way to proceed to a \nmatter than cloture.\n  I wish to switch a little bit here and talk about something that is \nextremely personal to me. I have been a legislator for a long time. The \nfirst job I had in public office was in 1964. I have been involved in \ngovernment for 42 years. I was a city attorney, served on county \nboards, the State legislature, and other such opportunities that the \npeople of the State of Nevada have given me. I don't want this to be \ntrue confessions,\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\nbut I want to relate to the Senate that the biggest mistake I ever \nmade, the largest error I ever made was 15 or 18 years ago, as a Member \nof the U.S. Congress, when, with my chief of staff, my dear friend \nReynaldo Martinez--he and I played baseball together. He was a star on \nthat team. I wasn't. But we beat everybody. We were the California \nScholastic Federation champions when I was a sophomore in high school.\n  He was my chief of staff. He is retired, a wonderful man. He has \ncredentials in the Hispanic community. He has had a school named after \nhim in Nevada. He has a youth center named after him. He is a very \nfamous Nevadan and my dear friend.\n  A group of people came and talked to us and convinced us that the \nthing to do would be to close the borders between Mexico and the United \nStates; in effect, stop people from coming across our borders to the \nUnited States. This period of time for which I am so apologetic--to my \nfamily, mostly--lasted about a week or two. I introduced legislation. \nMy little wife is 5 feet tall. We have been together for soon to be 50 \nyears. As I said here on the floor a few days ago, her father was born \nin Russia. He was run out of Russia. His name was Goldfarb, his family. \nThey were Jewish. My wife heard that I had done this. She does not \ninterfere with my legislation. Only when I ask her does she get \ninvolved in what I am doing. I didn't ask her about this. She, in \neffect, said: I can't believe that you have done it. But I had done it.\n\n  To compound this, I held a meeting a day or two after being \nconfronted by my wife, a meeting in Las Vegas. It was a townhall \nmeeting to explain this travesty that I called legislation. My friend, \nJudge John Mendoza, was there, somebody who, when I lost my Senate race \nin 1974 by 524 votes, spent all night with me consoling me, but he was \nin that audience. Larry Luna, Larry Mason, Isabelle Pfeiffer, people I \nhad not talked to about this, in addition to my wife, pointed out the \nerrors of my way. I have done everything since that meeting in Las \nVegas, in conversation with my wife, to undo my embarrassment.\n  I have nothing against my friend, the junior Senator from Alabama, \nfor bringing up what I had said those many years ago today on the \nSenate floor. I have no problem with that at all. But I do want to tell \nhim and the rest of my friends in the Senate, that is a low point of my \nlegislative career, the low point of my governmental career. That is \nwhy I believe we need comprehensive immigration reform today. People in \nAmerica are counting on us to move forward with comprehensive \nimmigration reform. They recognize that this country's national \nsecurity depends on securing our borders and fixing our immigration \nsystem. They all want us to do this, Democrats and Republicans, to come \ntogether and do this.\n  I still believe that the bill before us is a compromise. I believe it \nis a good bill. It is up to my Republican friends to decide what they \nwant to do. They can work with us to move forward and vote cloture and \nhave some amendments that are germane postcloture. My friends, the \nmajority, can move forward with a bill that will fix our borders and \nreform the immigration system or continue to stonewall. It is in the \neyes of the beholder who is stonewalling. I think what we have here is \na compromise. We have a real bipartisan opportunity to fix our \nimmigration system. Thanks to the hard work of the Democrats and \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee, we have a bill that will do it.\n  So I hope that tomorrow morning, an hour after we come into session, \nthat there will be a bipartisan vote to invoke cloture, move forward \nwith this legislation, look at those germane amendments, vote them up \nor down, and move forward with the process.\n  I, first of all, want everyone in this Chamber to know that there is \nno animosity between the two leaders. We have jobs to do. We do the \nbest we can to fulfill those responsibilities. But as far as the two of \nus are concerned, there is no ill will toward me from Senator Frist. He \nhas never shown that on a personal basis. I have attempted not to do \nthat with him. I will say on one occasion I did, and he brought it to \nmy attention. I acknowledged that, and I understood what he was \ncritical of. It was constructive criticism, and I took it as that.\n  I hope we can move forward. There have been proposals made by both \nsides. My friend's proposal on this side of the aisle was not \nacceptable. My proposal to him was not acceptable. But it is only 4 \no'clock. Maybe something will happen before tomorrow morning's cloture \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as I said in my remarks a few minutes ago, \nthe disappointing thing to me is the situation we are in, in that in \nall likelihood, unless we have a radical departure in the next hour, \nthe course we are on is to leave here in a few days having accomplished \nnothing for the American people. The American people expect more.\n  We all know that the institutions of government in today's world are \nwatched by the American people because we were elected on their behalf \nto identify problems, to struggle and work through those problems \nthrough a process that has worked well for a couple hundred years, and \nthat is debate and amendment. We have a bill on the floor that came out \nof the Judiciary Committee, a process I am actually proud of.\n  It has been confusing to people, I know, but I basically said: There \nis a problem out there that we know is there. It is getting worse. It \naffects the safety and security of the American people, plus the \ncompassionate side, people dying crossing the borders, plus 12 million \npeople who are having to wake up every day in the shadows out of fear \nthat in some way somebody is going to come and touch them in a \ndevastating way or not being able to report a domestic violence \nincident because it exposes them. That is wrong.\n  We have the opportunity--because of leadership, and working with the \nDemocratic leadership, we got a bill to the floor, knowing 3 to 4 \nmonths in advance that we would be here now spending time on it--to fix \nthe problem, to solve the problem. And maybe it is the surgical \npersonality in me that says, if somebody in the room has cancer, you \ncut it out. You just don't sit there and talk to them and say: Come \nback in a few weeks or a few months or a few years, because they die \nfrom not acting and fixing it.\n  That may be too much my approach, but stepping back from that, I know \nthis is a process here whereby if we start now and take the first \namendment from last week, the Kyl amendment, which was introduced and \nhas been discussed and debated, and last night we voted not to table \nit--why don't we take it and vote on it and go straight through, and \nthen we would have the opportunity to effect a bill. I think we can \nimprove the bill. I think it would get 60 votes for cloture, and then \nwe could have a bill that would solve the problems that are out there.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is well known that there are a number \nof Senators who have been engaged in active negotiations and are trying \nto come to an agreement so that we could get this very difficult and \nchallenging issue behind us. There are Senators Graham, Martinez, \nDomenici, Brownback, Hagel, and Specter, who led the legislation \nthrough the Judiciary Committee, and Senators Gregg, Obama, Salazar, \nDurbin, and especially Senator Kennedy. We have all been involved in \nnegotiations and discussions morning, noon, and night, as have our \nstaffs, as well as various outside groups. We are always very close to \nagreement. I cannot say we are going to reach agreement, but it is not \nfor lack of knowledge, expertise, or dedication in trying to solve this \nissue.\n  Senator Frist has encouraged us. We have met with him constantly and \nhe has offered his encouragement as a leader and we are grateful for \nthat. We are close. If we can reach an agreement, I think it would have \n60 votes in this body. I haven't seen an issue in recent years that has \nso much emotion associated with it. Nor do I know of one that probably \ndefines the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and what kind of \na nation we are.\n  The occupant of the chair, Senator Martinez, and Senator Salazar \nbrought a perspective to this issue which is very valuable. Both have \nadded life experiences on this issue. So it is not for lack of \nknowledge or expertise or talent, and we are very close.\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\n  But there has been a shadow on our discussions. The fact is the \nSenate has not moved forward with debate and amendments and votes. The \nSenate is supposed to do that. That is what this body is supposed to be \nall about. Now for a week and a half we have not been able to have a \nvote on a single issue. We should not be afraid to debate these issues \nand to vote on them. That is what we are supposed to do. We don't have \nto wait for cloture every time before we debate and have votes. Senator \nKyl and Senator Cornyn have devoted thousands of hours to this issue. \nThey deserve a vote on their proposal. That is the way the Senate is \nsupposed to function.\n  There are those on the other side who have amendments that probably \nwould be very tough votes for those of us on this side. We are here to \ntake tough votes. That is what we come here for--to take tough votes. I \ncould argue, as we do maybe too often, legitimately that this is one of \nthe greatest challenges we face in our time--securing our borders, \ntaking 11 million people out of the shadows who are exploited every \nday, fulfilling the job requirements that we all know are necessary to \nensure our economic future.\n  I want to assure the Democratic leader that those of us on this side \nfollow the leadership of our elected leader. We cannot vote for cloture \nwhen it is proposed by the other side. The majority rules. The majority \nsets the agenda in the Senate. For there to be an expectation that \nsomehow we would vote for cloture as proposed by the Democratic \nleader--I imagine if my friend from Nevada were in the majority, he \ncould take great exception to the Senator from Tennessee filing cloture \nand then expecting the other side to follow that.\n  We have a short period of time. I hope as these negotiations \ncontinue--and we are close, I must say. I think my friend from \nMassachusetts would agree, although I must say he is very interesting \nto negotiate with. But I also point out that his word is good.\n  I hope people will listen to the Senator from Florida, who is in the \nchair. I hope people will listen to the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nSalazar, and others who can explain to us better than anyone how urgent \nit is that we resolve this issue. Americans are unhappy with us, in \ngeneral. But this issue has aroused passion in a way that few of us \nhave ever seen across this country. In Los Angeles, Phoenix, Arizona, \nand New York City, and around the Nation, it seems to me we owe every \nAmerican a resolution on this issue.\n  Can we please move forward with amendments, start voting, and then \ncome to a resolution of this issue. I thank both leaders for their \nindulgence and my colleagues for their active involvement in this \nissue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sure it was an oversight by my friend \nfrom Arizona in just mentioning Senator Salazar, but also Senator \nMenendez has been involved in the things we have done over here, and he \nis a great addition to our caucus.\n  My friend from Arizona, who has established his credentials as being \ncourageous as none of the rest of us have, except perhaps Senator \nInouye, said we should not be afraid to take votes. So my suggestion--I \nmade it yesterday and I make it today--is that there has been \nsignificant debate on the Specter-Leahy substitute. It is now before \nthis body. We should not be afraid to vote on that. As I said, we are \nwilling to vote. We don't need to have cloture. We can have an up-or-\ndown vote on that right now. That is one alternative that could be \nconsidered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I think our point has been made. If we are \ngoing to address an issue that deserves to be addressed and that the \nAmerican people expect us to address, we have to change course here \nfrom the last several days. It is going to require amendments and \ndebate and allowing amendments to come to the floor. There is no \ncomparable bill. The Medicare bill had 128 amendments; the highway bill \nhad 47; the Energy bill had 70. But to think we can make progress on a \nbill flying through the Senate without the opportunity for debate and \namendment is unrealistic. It is outside of the realm of what the \nAmerican people expect and what our responsibilities are as Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I so appreciate that the majority \nleader has called this to the Nation's attention because we have been \nworking on this bill for almost 2 weeks now. The majority of the body \nhas not had its say. The Judiciary Committee worked very hard on this \nbill. However, it is a bill that I could not possibly invoke cloture on \nbefore we have had a chance to have input and the opportunity to change \nit in the direction that the full majority of this body--hopefully, a \nresounding majority of the body--would support.\n  The House of Representatives passed a bill that probably not one \nMember of the Senate would support. That is not going to be the final \nposition of Congress. The Senate is taking a different approach. The \nSenate, in general, agrees that there should be a guest worker program. \nIt has been very difficult to come up with the right solution on how \nour country handles the 12 million people who are here illegally--a \nsolution that is fair and equitable for the citizens of the United \nStates and ensures law and order on our borders. It would be wrong for \nCongress to pass a bill which indicates border security is business as \nusual, or that the laws of our country can be broken with no penalty \nwhatsoever. Most of us want to pass a guest worker program that allows \npeople to come back and forth legally into our country, help our \neconomy, earn their benefits and be able to keep them--not in the \nunderground, but aboveboard. Most of us want that.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us does not provide the right \nsolution. Yet, we are sincere in our desire to amend it. That is what \nour leader is trying to say. I think it is wrong for the Democratic \nminority to hold up amendments and not allow those who have worked for \nhours, days, weeks, and months on this bill, to offer alternatives, \nhear debate, and start shaping a bill that would put our country in the \nright direction, secure our borders, keep our friendship with Mexico--\nour neighbor to the South, and treat people fairly.\n  Passing a bill that achieves these objectives is a goal I think we \ncan all reach, but not if we cannot have amendments and are forced to \nvote on cloture. I could not possibly vote for cloture, nor could all \nbut one or two on our side. That is not bipartisan. It is not the \nprocess we have followed in this Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to let us proceed \nwith amendments. Don't waste the next 24 hours. Let Senator Kyl have \nhis chance to have his amendment voted on. Let others who have ideas \nhave their amendments voted on.\n  I think one area we have not significantly addressed, one I would \nlike to be able to talk about, is an alternative for people who do not \nseek citizenship in America. There are many wonderful Mexican workers \nin our country who want to remain citizens of Mexico, who intend to \nstay with their families in Mexico, but who desire the economic \nopportunities in America. Why would we not provide them an opportunity \nto come out of the shadows, to work and earn their pay in the open, and \nthen go home? Why should they wait in a 10-year line for U.S. \ncitizenship, which they do not seek?\n  Clearly, we have not fully vetted this issue. The Judiciary Committee \nworked hard to produce a bill, a bill which I do not support. Yet, they \ncertainly worked hard, did their homework, and were very thorough. We \nneed to have a chance to work on that bill with the rest of the Senate \nbecause most of us are not on the Judiciary Committee. Immigration is \nan issue that affects all of our States and our country as a whole. We \nneed to address it in a sincere, productive way that will come to the \nright solution. The only way to do that is to allow the Senate to \ndebate and vote on amendments. If we can come to a consensus, and have \na 75-to-25 vote, or a 90-to-10 vote on a final bill, then we would have \nproduced the right solution. We will not be able to do that if we \ninvoke cloture before voting on amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am seeking recognition, standing on the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Chair heard the Senator from \nKansas first.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I tell my friend from Illinois that I \nwill be very brief.\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\n  I understand all of the discussion has been about cloture. It has \nbeen about the process of the Senate. It has been about denying \nMembers--in this particular case, on our side--the ability to offer \namendments. Let me say that we are about to go on a 2-week recess \nwithout doing anything about trying to secure our borders. We are doing \nsome things, but we are not doing the things we need to do. There are \n32,200 reasons why we should move and why we should reach \naccommodation, if we possibly can, to pass a good immigration reform \nbill. That is 32,200 people who will be coming across our borders \nduring the 2 weeks we will be in recess. And 2,300 are coming across \nper day as of today. There have been about 150 come across our borders \nillegally while we have been speaking.\n  As a matter of fact, as chairman of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence, I know how this affects our national security. I know all \nthe talk has been about procedure and germaneness and allowing \namendments. But let me talk a minute about national security.\n  Mr. President, 1.2 million illegal aliens were apprehended as they \ncame across our borders last year. Two or three times that amount were \nnot apprehended. If you lived in Tucson, the number was about 439,000 \nwho were apprehended. Two or three times that amount were not \napprehended. If you lived in Yuma, in California, that number was about \n140,000 approximately, and in McAllen, TX, there were 135,000 in just 1 \nyear.\n  Of the 1.2 million who were apprehended who came across illegally--I \nam not talking about the ones who came across and were not \napprehended--165,000 were persons coming from countries other than \nMexico. Where did they come from? We are talking about the Middle East. \nWe are talking about Southeast Asia. We are talking about Eastern \nEurope. We know because we have apprehended people from Afghanistan, \nPakistan, Iraq, and Iran. We have actually apprehended people from \nIran, 10 of them, and Somalia and Venezuela.\n  I want to say something about these folks. Their goals may be to find \na job and be part of the American dream, but they may not be as well. \nAnd truthfully, I think that is only a snapshot of the reality.\n  I think the intelligence community can tell you who we caught, but \nthey can't tell you who we haven't caught. So at 2,300 people coming \nacross the border who are illegal every day--every day that we argue or \nthat we don't argue it, that basically we don't have an opportunity to \nconsider the amendments and move this bill forward, national security \nis being threatened.\n  I want Members to consider that and see if we can't work toward some \nsolution that will allow a series of amendments to be considered and \nmove on with this bill. Otherwise, in the next 2 weeks, I have to tell \nmy colleagues, the people of Kansas are going to look at me or, for \nthat matter, every Senator and say: What on Earth are you doing going \non recess for 2 weeks when you have 32,200 more people coming in, most \nof whom are not vetted and some could be injurious to the national \nsecurity of the United States?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I asked my staff how many amendments have \nbeen filed to this bill. The number is 228 amendments; 228 amendments \nhave been filed to this bill. If you follow the proceedings of the \nSenate, you know there is no way on Earth we can consider 228 \namendments and actually vote on this bill by the end of this week or \neven by the end of next week. It is physically impossible. Decisions \nwill have to be made, as they are made on every single piece of \nlegislation, on which amendments will be cut, which amendments will be \nconsidered.\n  I have had amendments that I thought were extremely important that \ndidn't make the cut. That is the nature of this Chamber. Sometimes we \nhave to step back and say at some point we will have to vote on a bill \nif we want a bill passed.\n  Our concern on this side of the aisle is that if we get mired down in \nthe amendment process, we have a fundamental problem. What we are \nwitnessing here you cannot analogize to a baseball game because in a \nbaseball game, there is no clock. In the Senate, there is a clock, not \njust by day but by week. And at the end of this week, we are scheduled \nto go on recess.\n  For that reason, Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader of the \nSenate, filed a cloture motion yesterday. Under the Senate rules, that \nmeans that tomorrow morning at about 10 o'clock, we will vote as to \nwhether we want to close off debate, close off the amendment number at \n228, or let more amendments pile on.\n  What is the likelihood that we would consider and pass this bill this \nweek if we allow all amendments to be filed that each Member wishes? \nThere is no chance whatsoever.\n  What Senator Reid believes and I share is that we have a historic \nopportunity. We may never get this chance again. The last time we had \nany serious debate about immigration reform was more than a decade ago. \nHonestly, the situation has gotten worse in this country ever since. \nNow we have a chance. We have a chance because on a bipartisan basis, \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee produced a bill. It is not perfect, but \nit is a good bill, strongly supported by Senator Kennedy on our side \nand Senator McCain on the other side, supported by Republicans and \nDemocrats who brought it out of the committee 12 to 6.\n  Our fear is that if we allow this process to mire down with hundreds \nof amendments, the clock will run out; we will have missed our chance.\n  It pains me to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say \nthere is no way we can vote for cloture, there is no way we can vote to \nclose down the amendments that are going to be filed here. We have to \nstand together as a party. I think there is more at stake. I think this \nbill, this bipartisan bill, is evidence that both parties can come \ntogether and must come together if we are going to solve an intractable \nproblem, such as the problem of immigration reform.\n  America is not going to remember whether we considered 1 amendment, 5 \namendments, 10 amendments or 20 amendments. America will not remember \nwhether Senator Kyl's amendment was called first or fifth in order. But \nAmerica will remember with this vote tomorrow who was on the right side \nof history, who was on that side of history that said we have to move \nforward to reconcile a serious challenge in this Nation.\n\n  The Senator from Kansas talks about security. I am happy to report to \nhim that every bill under consideration dealing with immigration has \nstrong security provisions. There is a provision offered by Senator \nFrist to make our borders stronger. Virtually the same provision is \nbeing offered on the Democratic side of the aisle in a bipartisan bill. \nThere is no argument about enforcement, strengthening our borders, \nknowing who is here, where they work, where they live, and what they \ndo. If we are going to be a secure nation, that is essential.\n  There is no argument about employer enforcement. It has to be part of \nan enforcement system.\n  Where we do have differences of opinion, of course, is what to do \nwith 11 or 12 million people already here. We think we have struck the \nright balance, giving people an opportunity over an 11-year period of \ntime to earn their way to citizenship. If they work hard, if they have \na job, if they pay their taxes, if they have had a criminal background \ncheck, if they are learning English, if they know about our Nation's \nhistory and its civics, if the people who are asking for this clearly \nare good citizens, people of good moral virtue, those are the ones we \nwant as part of our Nation.\n  I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say unless we can \ncall one amendment or five amendments before 10 o'clock tomorrow \nmorning, we would as soon see this process stop. That would be \nunfortunate. Voting for cloture doesn't mean there is an end to \namendments. It means there is a limited time for those amendments \npending, some 30 hours. We still have time to debate and amend this \nbill, and we will. But Senator Reid and I share in the belief that we \nneed a process that brings this to a conclusion. There is no way we can \ndeal with 228 amendments and have this bill completed this week. That \nis why we moved forward on this effort to try to file cloture on a \nbipartisan basis and move this bill to final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first, I thank our majority leader for \ncoming to the floor and pointing out what is happening because I think \nthis is a miscarriage of justice, very unfair, and is an indication of \nwhat is fundamentally wrong with the Senate these days. It is important \nthat in the light of day, the American people be told why immigration \nreform, on which the American people feel very strongly we should act \nand I believe they feel we should put great focus on border security, \nis long overdue.\n  We made runs on it in the past. I was around when we passed \nimmigration reform, by title at least, in 1986 and again in 1996. It \ndidn't work. We have to do more for border security. We have to decide \nif we want a temporary worker program, how is it going to be assigned, \nwhat are the responsibilities for it to be implemented, and exactly how \nare we going to deal with, again, 11 and 12 million people who are in \nthis country.\n  Frankly, I have very little to say on this subject because I am not a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. I do not consider myself an \nauthority, an expert on the substance, as is my colleague from Arizona, \nSenator Kyl. He worked on it. He is on the Judiciary Committee. They \ndiscussed it, considered it for weeks and months. I have a lot of \nrespect for the work that was done in the committee.\n  I have been proud that our majority leader, Senator Frist, has forced \nthis issue to a head. Some people have said: Wait a minute, we are not \nready, we haven't had time to cook this issue; there are too many \nproblems. We should have done this last year, and our leader has been \nsaying since January this issue must be addressed. It is overdue, and \nit is going to be addressed. And, frankly, he told us when it was \ncoming up--last week. He forced an action in the Judiciary Committee. \nMaybe it was a forced action, but it was time we acted.\n  I have made the point in a variety of forums in the last couple of \ndays that this is what the Senate ought to be doing. This is a big, \nimportant, difficult issue. The American people expect us to act \ninstead of sweeping around the edges on salami issues and all kinds of \nother issues. This is a big issue. This is an important issue. This is \nabout who we are and who we are going to be.\n  Thank goodness the Senate is living up to the expectations our \nforefathers had for us: to take up a tough issue, have a debate, have \namendments, and have votes. And all of a sudden people say: Oh, we \ncan't have votes; we can't vote on amendments on both sides of the \naisles. Senators are saying: I don't want to have to cast a tough vote. \nHallelujah, finally we are going to do something that matters around \nhere.\n  Will we get it right? I don't know. I have been trying to listen to \nboth sides of the debate. I want action. I hope it is the right one. \nBut we are never going to know until we go forward and consider this \nissue and get it done in a responsible way.\n  If forced to vote on the bill that came out of the committee right \nnow, I would vote against it. I don't think we have found a third way. \nI don't think we have found the sweet spot. I think we have to have \nmore responsibility.\n  Illegal aliens are illegal. This is a very difficult, sensitive \nproblem. We have to think about it. But I don't think we can say: OK, \ngee, say you're sorry and pay a fine and everything will be OK. It has \nto be more serious than that.\n  I was looking forward to amendments. Some people will say: Oh, vote \nfor cloture, let's get this over with; there are too many amendments. \nWe haven't voted on one amendment. We have been dragging around here \nfor over a week now. Senator Kyl has tried every way in the world to \nget a vote, and the minority in the Senate is blocking even a vote on a \ncritical amendment by a senior Senator in the leadership of the \nmajority, I might add, because they don't want to vote.\n  Frankly, for floor people, I note there are some ways this issue can \nbe stuffed down the opposition's throat. I don't want to do that. I \nthought we were going to rise to the occasion and have a bipartisan \ndebate.\n  This is the Senate. This is not the House. And, by the way, I have \nbeen a party to stuffing the minority, and people didn't agree with me. \nI filled up the tree. I filed cloture instantly on bills and on \namendments. But almost every way, almost every time it backfired on me. \nI admit it now. I remember filling up the tree and blocking Senator \nMcCain from offering his amendment on campaign finance reform. I did it \nmore than once. I told him I was going to do it. In the end, he won.\n  This tactic that has been employed by the Democratic leadership \nblocking even a vote on amendments on an issue of this magnitude is \noutrageous and, quite frankly, I am offended cloture has been filed by \nthe minority leader. It is not unprecedented. It has been done 18 times \nin the last 10 years. Yes, I did it, too, and again, it doesn't add to \nanything. It destroys the potential for good will.\n  I will vote against any cloture motion filed by the minority leader. \nHe does not manage the Senate. The majority leader does. And even when \nI disagree with him--I admire Senator McCain standing up and saying: I \nam not going to support that. Senator McCain has the high hand, he has \nthe winning hand probably, but he said: Wait a minute, you can't block \nSenators from even having a vote on their amendments, even though he is \ngoing to vote against them and speak against them.\n  What have we done here? This approach cannot stand, it will not \nstand, and what I am going to urge our leadership to consider doing is \nif we don't get something worked out by sunrise, then the Senate \nDemocrats are going to be cut out. There is a way we can get an \nagreement between the Republicans in the House and the Senate, the \nmajority in the House and the Senate, and force it to the floor whole-\nhog and say: Vote for it, up or down. It can be done. I don't want to \ndo that. I object to that. But when David Broder writes these articles \nabout how he can't understand why the majority doesn't work with the \nminority, hey, Mr. Broder, take a look at the Senate today. This is the \nkind of conduct which makes it impossible for us to get our work done \nand makes the majority decide to just ignore the minority.\n\n  I am one of those people whose votes hang in the balance. I am not \nlocked into a position. I probably am willing to go further toward what \nthe Judiciary Committee did than some of my colleagues. But I am \noffended by this, and it may affect my overall vote on the final \nproduct.\n  This bill has the potential to be bipartisan. It has the potential to \nbe a major achievement by the Senate and by the Congress and, more \nimportantly, for the American people. I hope our leadership will say: \nOh well, maybe we just didn't talk enough to each other, and let's work \nthis out. Let's go forward. We are not going to be able to finish this \nlegislation this week. So what. Take next week. Take next month. This \nissue is too big, too important. The illegal alien problem we have in \nthis country--and the need for immigration reform--is doing serious \ndamage to our country. There are good aspects to the bill, but there is \ndamage being done and the relationship between people is not moving in \na positive way. This is where we show whether we are statesmen or \npolitical hacks who are just trying to find a way to avoid a tough \nvote.\n  I plead with my colleagues: Let's find a way to go forward on this \nand get a solution we can all vote for and feel good about. Right now, \nwe should be ashamed of what we are doing and the way we look.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments of the \nSenate's time to try to put this legislation at least into some \nperspective, as someone who has worked on legislation dealing with \nimmigration for some period of time, so the American people can have an \nunderstanding of what this debate is really all about.\n  I think all of us understand what has been well stated here, and that \nis our borders are broken and porous. Ten years ago, we estimated that \nabout 40,000 were coming into this country illegally and we were \ncatching maybe almost half of them. Now the estimates are from 400,000 \nto over 1 million, and we are catching 5 or 10 percent of them. We have \nincreased expenditures by $20 billion in terms of law enforcement and \nbuilding fences and increasing border\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\nguards 300 percent over the period of the last 10 years, and it doesn't \nwork. It has not worked, and it is not working today. Although there \nare a number of our colleagues who believe it offers the best way to \ntry to get a handle on our borders.\n  That was the position which was taken by the House of Representatives \nand passed by the House of Representatives, effectively criminalizing \nevery individual who is undocumented here in the United States and \ncriminalizing any individual who might have been indirectly helping \nthat person, whether it was a minister, a member of the clergy, or a \nnonprofit organization such as a humane group that operates in a \nfeeding program or looks after people who have been in shelters. That \nis why Bishop Mahony, the cardinal of Los Angeles, said that the House \nlegislation was such a vicious piece of legislation. Those aren't my \nwords; those are his. That was the position of the House of \nRepresentatives. Many of us who have worked on immigration issues \nbelieve that is not the answer.\n  The fact is, it was the majority leader who introduced similar \nlegislation in the Senate of the United States which to many of us \nrepresented the position of the Republican Party. That was the position \nwhich was introduced by the majority leader. There wasn't a great deal \nof turmoil or opposition at the time he did that, so that was why many \nthought that was going to be the position of the Republican Party. That \nis at least one aspect of this debate and discussion.\n  Another aspect of it: Some 3\\1/2\\ years ago, the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain, introduced legislation dealing with immigration in \na more comprehensive way--rather than just law enforcement, looked at \nother factors in addition to law enforcement. Over 3 years ago, I \nintroduced legislation that looked at a number of different aspects in \nterms of legalization and other kinds of approaches but different from \nthose of Senator McCain. At about that time, Senator Hagel and Senator \nDaschle introduced different legislation. This was all before the 2004 \nelection.\n  Then, after the election, when we saw that these different pieces of \nlegislation which were introduced were not working, Senator McCain and \nI worked together and in May of 2005 introduced common legislation. We \nwere convinced of a number of things. We were convinced, first of all, \nabout the importance of securing our borders from a national security \npoint of view. You have all these individuals who are coming in here, \nand in the wake of 9/11, we don't know who they are, and this presents \na national security issue. If you have millions of immigrants who are \nvirtually underground because they are undocumented, this is a national \nsecurity issue. When we find out that Homeland Security is worried \nabout different cells in different parts of the country, and we know we \nhave millions of immigrants who are subject to exploitation because \nthey are undocumented, this is a national security issue.\n  So we looked at it and said: What are the features that are going to \nbe necessary to deal with national security, because that is very \nimportant, and to deal with the fact that there is this magnet, drawing \npeople to the United States, the magnet of the American economy so that \nstrong individuals who want to provide for their families, work hard, \nplay by the rules, and provide for their families are offered jobs by \nAmerican employers? So they come here and send money back to look after \ntheir children and families, to develop a community. Many hard-working \nindividuals have come, and many of them have enlisted in the Armed \nForces of our country. More than 70,000 are serving in the Armed Forces \nof our country. Permanent resident aliens are in the Armed Forces \nserving in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n  So we said: What is necessary is we have to bring these people out of \nthe shadows. How are we going to do that? We have to entice them out so \nthey feel they can be a part of our American system, and how is that \ngoing to happen? Since they cut in front of this line instead of \nwaiting their turn, if they were to follow the immigration laws, we \nwould say: You have to go to the back of the line. You have to go to \nthe back of the line. You have to wait until that line is cleared up. \nYou have to pay a fine, pay your taxes, abide by the laws of this \ncountry, work hard, and then, 11 years from now--11 years from now--you \nwill be eligible to become an American citizen. The other side says: We \ncan't do that because that is amnesty. That is amnesty.\n  It is very interesting that whenever we talk about the undocumented, \nin many instances men and women who work hard, who are trying to \nprovide for their families, who are devoted to their religion--98 \npercent of the undocumented are working today. Working. These are \nqualities which we admire--people who work hard, provide for their \nfamilies, have beliefs in their God, are attentive to their church, \ncare for their children--all qualities we admire. But that is too bad; \nwe are just going to send them back or criminalize them. We are going \nto send them back.\n  So we have a difference here in the Senate. We have an agreement that \nwe have to get a border and it has to be secure. We have the \nundocumented, and the question is, How are we going to deal with them? \nAnd we have differences in this body. Many say we have to send them \nback. We heard speeches even earlier today saying that we can't permit, \nunder any circumstances, that they remain here in this country. There \nhas been no talk about how they are going to do it. Of the 240 \namendments that are before us, I didn't see any asking for $240 billion \nto get the buses out there to ship them back, while their children, who \nare American citizens, are pleading that they remain here, and their \nchildren are going to school and want their parents to stay. No, no. \nLet's just get a bumper-sticker solution and call it amnesty. Bumper \nsticker: It Is Amnesty. Bumper sticker: Bad. It is just a bumper-\nsticker solution, rather than dealing with a complex issue.\n  So Senator McCain and I worked on this issue. We worked out the \nprogram, the penalties, the requirements for people who are here to be \nable to earn their way toward the possibility of citizenship, bring \nthem out of the shadows, treat them in a humane way, understanding that \nwe have a problem and an issue. And as much as those on the other side \nof the aisle might bellyache about this solution, they don't have any \nanswer, other than criminalizing it. That is the answer they have: \ncriminalizing. So we have what I consider a just solution. It may not \nbe the right one, it may not be, but at least it is--I believe and the \nmajority of the American people believe that earning your way to be a \ncitizen in this country is an acceptable way to treat these \nindividuals.\n  So then the issue is, we have a magnet here in the United States. Now \nwe are talking about the border. How are we going to lessen the \npressure on the border? There are a number of things in our bill. One \nis that we want to try to cooperate with Mexico, the countries of \nCentral America, in terms of trying to work out more effective ways and \nmeans of being able to do it. There are a variety of different ways. \nThe Mexican Government has indicated that. I think there are a variety \nof different ways of trying to do that to lessen the pressure. We have \nbasically the only proposal that gives any consideration to that \nwhatsoever, and I think it can be extremely meaningful.\n  We find the remittances, as they go back to Mexico, to many of these \ncommunities. So many of the people who are here remit funds because \nthey care about their families and their communities. We could work \nwith Mexico to lessen the pressure.\n  Nonetheless, we understand that we are still going to be a magnet. So \nwe say: OK, let's set a figure. We had a negotiation, and 400,000 was \nthe figure for temporary workers. After 4 years, they have an \nopportunity to petition for a green card and after 5 more years--to \nbecome 9 years--to be able to become American citizens if they \ndemonstrate they have worked hard, paid their taxes, haven't run into \ntrouble with the law.\n  So we are saying we want to make the borders secure in terms of the \nsecurity issues, and we want to make it safe for people to come here, \nand we want to have a process so that the magnet which is the American \neconomy will draw people in an orderly way--not to replace American \njobs but to advertise and see if there are Americans available. But if \nthey are jobs Americans won't do, there will be a\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\nlegal way for people to come in. So the person who is down in the \ncenter part of Mexico will have an alternative: Do you want to risk \ngoing across the desert and dying in the desert, or do you want to go \nto your embassy and find out if there is a job for which you are \nqualified and go to the United States and have at least some job \nprotection in the job you have? That is the alternative. Legality. \nLegality. Legality in gaining entrance, not illegal across the border, \nearning the legal position by earning your legalization.\n  Then we have the enforcement provisions. In the United States, if \nemployers are going to hire undocumented aliens, then we have 5,000 \nindividuals who are going to be trained and equipped to be able to go \nafter employers who are going to attempt to violate the law. The \ntemporary worker gets the biometric card, comes up and presents it to \nthe employer, and then we know he or she is documented. If not, then we \nknow he is undocumented, and then that person is going to be subject to \npenalties. It has never been tried before, but it is a local process \nand a legal system.\n  What many of us are saying here tonight is we have a total package \nthat talks about the border, talks about the temporary worker, talks \nabout law enforcement, and talks about earned legalization. That is the \npackage. That is the package that came out of the Judiciary Committee \n12 to 6. Not bits and pieces, not just border security like the \nRepublican leader had or like the House of Representatives had. It \ngarnered 12 members of the Judiciary Committee, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, in a bipartisan way, after 7 days of hearings, 6 days \nof markups, and scores of different amendments. What Senator Reid is \ntalking about is why not let us have a vote on that particular approach \nto the challenge that we are facing on immigration? There are those who \njust want law enforcement--fine. But why is it that those who worked, \nand worked hard, and looked at this and studied it, and studied hard, \nand after days of hearings and a lot of work--why should we be denied \nthe opportunity to have a vote on the total package?\n\n  That is what we are being asked. We are being asked: Let's split that \npackage up somewhat. Let's try to divert it.\n  I know there are those strongly opposed to it. I respect them. I have \nheard them. I listened to them. They are on our committee and strongly \noppose it. I strongly respect that. But aren't we entitled to at least \na chance to have a vote on a comprehensive approach? What is so \ndifficult about it? I agree with the Senator from Mississippi, this is \nimportant. We ought to be continuing on this issue. It is of vital \nimportance and consequence. It affects the lives of hundreds of \nthousands, millions of people. We have seen what is out there, across \nthe country--500,000 people in southern California, 100,000 people in \nChicago. You are going to see next Monday in 10 different cities, more \nthan a million individuals who are out there demonstrating.\n  Why are we not dealing with this? Why don't we deal with it? What \nmany of us are asking, including myself, is give us at least the \nopportunity to vote on that. If that is not successful, if we cannot \nget the majority here, then so be it. We have to find a different \napproach.\n  We talk about trying to work through these accommodations. I am \nalways interested in listening to individuals, people who are concerned \nabout this. We have had, as I mentioned, early in this debate, the \nextraordinary stories from our friend and colleague, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenici, telling his life story--the absolutely \nextraordinary story of his parents. We listened to the good Senator \nfrom Florida, Mel Martinez, talk about this. I listened to my \ncolleagues. Ken Salazar's relatives were here 250 years before any of \nour ancestors were here, down in the Southwest and out in Colorado. We \nlistened to Bob Menendez as well. We listened to our other colleagues \nwho have been engaged in this. They understand its difficulty and its \ncomplexity.\n  We do have a recommendation from our committee. It seems that in the \nlife of this institution we ought to be able to have a vote on that \nparticular proposal. If it does not carry, then we will have to deal \nwith the other reality. But to deny us the opportunity to get that as \nwell as consider other amendments, as the Senator from Illinois pointed \nout, that will be relevant and current tomorrow, after cloture--I think \nwould be an enormous loss.\n  I certainly have worked and I am glad to work to reduce the \ndifferences among views and opinions. I think all of us are going \nthrough the learning experience. As much as we know about immigration, \nwe always learn more from talking with people who are concerned and \ninterested and knowledgeable about these issues. The legislative \nprocess is an evolving process. I have certainly observed that over an \nextensive period of time. So we are always interested.\n  If there are ways we can achieve the outlines that we talked about, \nat least from my point of view then it makes sense. What does not make \nsense is to try to separate different groups against each other. That I \nfind difficult to accept. We cannot have one group that has been here \nfor a lengthy period of time, another group that has been here almost \nas long, and have them treated in different ways. That doesn't really \nsolve the problem. It might help some people in terms of how they are \ngoing to vote on a particular issue, but it really is not dealing with \nthe substance. We are interested in dealing with the substance, not \njust getting safe political positions for our colleagues. We want to \nget this legislation done.\n  We certainly want to try to find common ground, right up until the \nvery end. I will certainly work in any way I can. I know others are \nthinking and working hard on it. As has been pointed out by every \nspeaker, this is too important a piece of legislation to let it slip \nby. It is too important.\n  I am proud of the proposal that is before the Senate. I think it is \nthe result of a great deal of thought and examination by a variety of \nour different colleagues from all parts of the country and with all \ndifferent kinds of constituents. When you get an issue that is as \nvolatile as this, and you have a 12 to 6 vote and you have that kind of \nbipartisanship in this, recognize those of us who support this proposal \nunderstand it is a total kind of approach to the challenge. The single-\nshot approaches have not worked. Let's just try, here in the United \nStates Senate, to give an opportunity for this comprehensive approach, \nwhich is meaningful in terms of our national security, is enormously \nimportant in terms of economic progress, and most important is a \nreflection of our humanitarian values. Let's give that a chance. That \nis what we are hoping, and I hope the Senate will give us that \nopportunity to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Massachusetts leaves \nthe floor, I wonder if I might ask him a question--if he would be kind \nenough just to respond to this, I hope.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts was one of the prime participants in \nour Judiciary Committee markup and meetings. He was on the prevailing \nside of the vote which passed out the bill which we are now debating.\n  I inform the Senator, by the way, it was my recommendation at the \nleadership meeting that rather than the leader's bill, the Senate \njudiciary bill be the underlying bill.\n  The question I wanted to ask the Senator is this: The Senator is \naware of the Cornyn-Kyl bill, which to some extent is a competitor of \nthe bill that passed. That was rejected in the Judiciary Committee; \nthat is to say, we lost that vote.\n  The Senator was talking a moment ago about alternatives in the \nSenate, I believe. I don't think he would want to be misunderstood in \nthis regard. He said there is no answer but to criminalize them. I know \nthe Senator--I presume the Senator did not mean that in the Senate \nthere has been nothing proposed except to criminalize the people who \nare here illegally because the Senator, of course, is aware of the \nalternative legislation Senator Cornyn and I introduced.\n  Would the Senator at all like to comment on that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The remarks that I had were directed toward the \nundocumented. The Senator from Arizona has an amendment that is \nportrayed as only preventing the adjustment status for criminals, but \nif you look and examine the various provisions which are included in \nthe Senator's amendment,\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\nthey also include the status offenders which effectively would be \ndenied any opportunity for the benefits of this legislation.\n  In the provisions included in the legislation--I haven't got the \namendment right before me, but there are three or four different items \nthat would do so. That, I think, goes to the heart of this whole \nprocess because effectively, if the Cornyn-Kyl amendment is adopted, it \neffectively takes out 60 percent, as I understand it, of those who are \nundocumented from any kind of adjustment of status.\n  I have listened to the Senator debate this. That is certainly my \nunderstanding and the understanding of others who studied it carefully, \nand that would leave the individuals in the kind of state they are \ntoday, where they would have an illegality in their current status and \nwould continue to be subject to the kinds of exploitation which is \nhappening now and continue to depress wages on other workers. I believe \nthat would really strike at the heart of the legislation. I know the \nSenator does not agree with me on that.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could just ask the Senator from \nMassachusetts, I was not referring to the amendment which is pending on \nthe floor of the Senate. I was referring to the Cornyn-Kyl bill, which \nis a comprehensive immigration reform bill that deals with enforcement \nat the border, enforcement at the worksite, a temporary worker program, \na way to deal with the illegal immigrants different in ways from the \nbill that passed the Judiciary Committee but nonetheless is a \ncomprehensive reform bill which was voted down. But it does represent \nan alternative on which we would like to have a vote on the Senate \nfloor.\n  I wanted to give the Senator an opportunity to acknowledge that in \nthe Senate there are alternatives to criminalizing the illegal \nimmigrants--if he wanted to?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thought at the beginning of the Senator's comments he \nwas referring to the amendment----\n  Mr. KYL. There was a misunderstanding.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator notes, the House bill had the \ncriminalization. The Frist bill had the criminalization issues. The \nCornyn-Kyl does not have that particular provision. I do think when we \nvoted on that issue, on the Durbin amendment, I think the Senator voted \nagainst the Durbin amendment, if I am correct, which was to \ndecriminalize. So I don't quite know what the Senator's position is on \nthe issue, but I stand corrected.\n  I was mentioning the House bill and the Senate majority leader's \nbill.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. In the debate and \ncharacterization of things, sometimes we make a characterization and it \nmight be subject to misinterpretation. It may well not have been, but \nin any event, I appreciate the Senator's clarification.\n  I want to respond to several things that have been said here--first \nof all, to join the majority leader and the others who have spoken to \nthe issue of the need for a debate and the ability to offer amendments \nand to vote on those amendments as a part of this very important \nlegislative effort. I don't know that we will do anything more \nimportant this year than try to adopt comprehensive immigration reform. \nIt is critical to my State. There are an awful lot of people in the \nState of Arizona illegally who do not enjoy the protection of the law, \nand should. Simply because they came here illegally, they should not be \ndenied that protection. We need to find a way to ensure that in some \nway the status of everyone who works in and remains in the United \nStates is in a legal status. It is also critical that we secure the \nborder and provide an enforcement mechanism to ensure that people who \nwork here work here legally.\n  Let me divide my remarks in two pieces, if I could, first of all, to \nrespond to something the Senator from Illinois, the minority whip, had \nto say when he was here. He noted there are about 200 amendments that \nhave been filed. His point was it is hard to figure out which ones to \nconsider.\n  My point is this. If anything is certain, it is that if you do not \nstart, you don't consider any of them. It is always the case that there \nare more amendments filed than are considered. But at least we start \nthe process at the beginning of the debate. I laid down an amendment \nlast Thursday afternoon. It is the pending amendment. This is Wednesday \nafternoon. Tomorrow it will be pending an entire week. It was the first \namendment laid down. The other 199 followed it. We have not even gotten \na vote on amendment No. 1 yet.\n  To complain that there are 200 amendments out there and we just don't \nknow where to start and it has been a whole week and we can't figure \nout where to start and that is why we are stopping you from voting on \nany of them doesn't wash. Let's be very clear. The reason the \nDemocratic side has prevented us from offering amendments and from \nvoting on amendments is because they don't want to vote on them--\nperiod. It is not that there are so many they can't figure out which \nones to allow a vote. They don't want to vote on them.\n  Why? There are two reasons. The first is they like the bill as it is. \nThat is a perfectly legitimate point. But that is always the case with \none side or the other. But whichever side doesn't like the bill gets a \nchance to try to amend it. If the majority is right, that they have the \nvotes, they can vote these amendments down.\n  Senator Kennedy just spoke to the amendment that is pending. He \nobviously does not think it is a good amendment. He is going to vote \nagainst it. I think it is a real good amendment and it goes right to a \npoint of the bill that is pending before us: should criminals be \nallowed to participate in the benefits of this legislation? I say no.\n  That is an amendment that people do not want to vote on. I guess that \nis the other thing. Not only do a lot of folks on the other side like \nthe bill as it is, and therefore they don't want to see it changed--\nalthough that is not really a good reason for denying us a right to \noffer amendments--but I don't think they want to take a vote on some of \nthese amendments perhaps because it is somewhat embarrassing.\n  I am willing to concede that there are lots of drafting errors. I \nhave made some including on this bill. So it is not always the way you \nwant it to be. But including crimes of moral turpitude and drug \ncrimes--whoever drafted the bill on the other side--they felt they had \ncut out criminals from participating in the program. The problem is, \nthere are a lot of crimes besides drug crimes and crimes of moral \nturpitude. I read that list. I think it would be better to simply say \nwe agree that we didn't mean for criminals to participate, and either \ntable the amendment or again vote for it or vote against it, whatever. \nBut we could have had that done with a long time ago. Instead we have \nspent a day debating on whether to vote on the amendment.\n  As I said before, with all these 200 amendments you are never going \nto get any of them done if you do not start. The Democratic side has \nprevented us from starting. As the majority leader said, that is not \nacceptable. And for the minority leader to file cloture to cut off \ndebate and cut off the filing of any other amendments, that adds insult \nto injury because then it says not only can't you debate this bill or \namendments that are offered, but there can't be any other amendments \noffered.\n  There is talk about some kind of compromise. Clearly, if a new \namendment is offered there should be an opportunity to respond to that \nin some way, including potentially offering an amendment to it. It is \nvery difficult because of the complexity of this bill to ensure that \nany amendment is germane. That is a term of art which you will hear in \nthis body, but that is all you can do after cloture is invoked, and it \nis hard to do that. It is no simple proposition to say let's close off \ndebate and finish the bill, whatever is germane. That is very difficult \nto do. Choking off debate with a cloture motion is done to stop \nfilibusters. There hasn't been a filibuster. We would like to get a \nbill. We would like to have debate and vote on amendments and vote on a \nbill.\n  Most of us in this body want comprehensive immigration reform.\n  The reason I engaged in the colloquy with the Senator from \nMassachusetts is because we have two competing versions. His version \npassed in the Judiciary Committee; mine did not. Both are \ncomprehensive. They both deal with border security, with security in \nthe entire area of the country, including at the workplace with a \ntemporary\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\nwork program and with providing a new status for the people who are \nhere illegally. They do that in different ways, but they both tackle \nthe same comprehensive issue.\n  It is a straw man that anybody on this side doesn't want a bill.\n  It is also wrong to say that we can't start voting because we just do \nnot know where to start. The reality is, we could have started and we \nshould have started and this bill is not going to be completed until we \nstart.\n  There were a couple of things that the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid that I want to clarify. One is there is quite a bit of derogation \nwith the House position. While there are some things in the House bill \nthat I agree with and others that I disagree with, I must say this is a \nvery different picture of what the House stands for and what \nRepublicans stand for than what has been portrayed.\n  For example, I think there are probably many out there who believe \nthe House bill stands for the proposition that we need to make it a \nfelony for people to be in this country illegally. And since the House \nis controlled by Republicans, that must be the Republican position. \nNothing could be further from the truth. I don't know of a Republican \nSenator, No. 1, who wants to have it a felony for a status violation of \nthe immigration law or for crossing the border illegally.\n  What happened in the House of Representatives? Representative \nSensenbrenner, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said we need to \ntake that felony status and change it to a misdemeanor. So a vote was \ntaken. On that vote there were 164 ayes and 257 nays. The vote lost. So \nit remained a felony.\n  Who voted against the amendment to make it a misdemeanor? Mr. \nPresident, 191 of the 202 Democrats voted against the amendment to turn \nthe felony to a misdemeanor; 191 of the 202 Democrats voted to leave it \na felony. The majority of Republicans voted to make it a misdemeanor.\n  Let us stop denigrating the House of Representatives, and in \nparticular the Republicans, by somehow contending that either \nRepublicans, or the majority of the House Members who are Republicans, \nwanted this to be a felony. It was the Democratic Members of the House \nof Representatives who voted to keep it a felony. The majority of \nRepublicans voted to make it a misdemeanor.\n  We need to clear up some of the impressions that have been created \naround here because of very sloppy language. I will put it that way so \nI don't ascribe any bad motive to anyone.\n  Part of that impression could have been created. That is what I was \ntrying to correct with the Senator from Massachusetts a moment ago when \nhe said that the alternative was to round them up and send them back \nand that there was no answer but to criminalize them. I appreciated \nwhat the Senator said because the Senate does not have a bill to \ncriminalize the status of aliens, certainly not to make them felonies. \nAnd no one I know of has proposed an alternative to round them up and \nsend them back. Everyone has agreed. I shouldn't say everyone because \nthere are people who believe it is possible to somehow force all of the \nillegal immigrants to be returned to their country of origin. I think \nthat is a very unrealistic option and that, therefore, it would not be \nappropriate to round up everybody and send them back. That is a false \nchoice. There isn't a bill on the floor of the Senate today that does \nthat.\n\n  Why are these false choices presented as the only alternative to the \nbill that is before us on the floor? As I pointed out, there are \nseveral other choices. One was introduced by Senator Cornyn and myself, \na comprehensive bill that doesn't round up everybody and send them back \nbut criminalizes everyone.\n  I think to engage in this debate we should engage with reason and \nwithout mischaracterizing things. There are good enough reasons to \noppose each other's bill without mischaracterizing them. If I have ever \nmischaracterized anything--I hope I haven't--I apologize for it.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts said something else that is very \nimportant. He said it was a necessity to have an incentive for illegal \naliens to come out of the shadows, and the bill that he and others had \ncrafted provided this potential for citizenship to provide that \nincentive.\n  That is one approach. I disagree with it. But that is certainly an \napproach. But it is not the only approach.\n  I want to go back to what most people have said about the people who \nare here illegally to illustrate a point. Most folks say they just came \nhere to do work that Americans won't do. Let me stipulate that many--in \nfact, the majority--of the people did come here to work. There is no \nquestion about that. Let us not forget that between 10 and 15 percent \nof the people who are apprehended when they come here by crossing the \nborder illegally are criminals. These are bad people. They don't just \ncome here to work. They come here for illicit purposes. They are \ncriminals and they need to be dealt with as criminals. That is between \n10 and 15 percent.\n  But there is another 85 to 90 percent who undoubtedly come here \nprimarily to work, to earn money, mostly to send back to friends or \nrelatives in their home country. So let us stipulate to that.\n  Most of them did not come here to become citizens of the United \nStates. As a matter of fact, Senator Hutchison pointed out something \nwhich is very true. If you know one thing about Mexican citizens, it is \nthat they are very proud. They have a beautiful country. It is actually \na wealthy country. Their culture is a tremendous culture and they are \nvery proud of it. They are very patriotic and nationalistic.\n  I think it is a bit odd that we--not me but many here--just assume \nthat they all want to be citizens of the United States. Many want the \nability to be here permanently, to reside here and to work here \npermanently, if that is their choice and they have green cards for that \nreason. Many other people from other parts of the world have green \ncards but don't choose to become citizens. That is fine. But we \nshouldn't presume that everyone wants to be a citizen simply because \nthey came here to work.\n  The other fallacy is they came here to do work that Americans won't \ndo. I think you have to amend that slightly to say that they came here \nto do work that Americans won't do at the price that people from other \ncountries are willing to do it for.\n  In fact, there is a lot of work that Americans are willing to do, if \nthe work is there, that people from foreign countries are doing today \nside by side. I mention the construction industry as a good example \nbecause in my State of Arizona it is hard to get enough good \nconstruction workers. There are many thousands, tens of thousands or \nmore, working in construction that are illegal. I would quickly grant \nthem temporary permits to work in the United States in construction. We \nneed their help. But I also know that in the field of construction \nthere have been many times when a very well-qualified American citizen \nconstruction worker can't find a job. It is very cyclical employment.\n  What we don't want to do is assume that all of the people who came \nhere from another country came here to do jobs that Americans won't do \nand, therefore, there will always be a job for them because Americans \nwill never do the work. Americans will do this kind of work. They will \ndo it gladly. They don't want to do it for free. They do not want to do \nit too cheaply. But there aren't very many jobs that they will do for a \npretty cheap price. If the jobs aren't there, obviously the reason we \nhave a temporary program is to issue a temporary permit while the job \nis there, and when the work returns you can start issuing more \ntemporary permits.\n  One of the problems with the underlying bill is you convert all the \ntemporary permits into permanent legal residency and then you have no \nability to ask anyone who is a guest here to leave because they have a \nright to stay here permanently even though there is no job for them \nsome years in the future.\n  The point is, it is true that you need an incentive for illegal \nimmigrants to participate in a legal program. All of the bills have \ndifferent kinds of legal programs. The Cornyn-Kyl bill has one; the \nbill on the floor has one. We provide a lot of incentives and some \ndisincentives. You can stay for up to 5 years under our bill. Nobody is \nrounded up and deported. You can stay for 5 years.\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\n  One reason that number was fixed was because the survey of over \n35,000 Mexican citizens who are illegal immigrants said if they could \nstay for 5 years and participate in the guest worker program, 71 \npercent of them said they would then return home. I don't know that \nthey all would. I think it is totally wrong to assume they all won't. \nThere is an incentive to stay here for 5 years. You can also \nparticipate in a temporary work program when you go home. The sooner \nyou go home the longer you can participate in that program. You can \nbuild a nest egg and take that back with you when you leave.\n  There are incentives in our bill as well. It may not be the incentive \nof citizenship. I don't think you have to have that incentive in order \nto, as the phrase goes, bring people out of the shadows.\n  Different people can argue about this. Reasonable people can differ \nabout all of these things. I am willing to listen to the debate on the \nother side. But I would ask a favor in return. Just as we allowed the \nbill to be passed out of the Judiciary Committee, as the Presiding \nOfficer is well aware--and we didn't filibuster the bill there, though \nit could have been filibustered--we allowed it to pass out knowing that \nit would pass over our votes. We had an alternative. It didn't have the \nvotes to pass. We would like an opportunity to vote on that alternative \non the floor of the Senate. Is that too much to ask?\n  We would like an opportunity to vote on about five amendments.\n  I am speaking now for Senator Cornyn and myself. That is all. We \nboiled it down to just five along with our underlying amendment. I \nwould like the opportunity to do that.\n  When we debated the energy bill, I think the comment was there were \nover 70 amendments, and these were significant amendments. This isn't \nlike the amendments to the budget bill. I think there have been two \nrelatively insignificant--well, one good--I won't characterize them. \nThere have been two amendments voted on. The authors, I am sure, \nthought they were all significant.\n  But the bottom line is nothing has gone to the heart of the bill one \nway or the other until that debate occurs and until those amendments \nare allowed to be offered and until they are allowed to be voted on. It \nis unfair to think that we could just shut off the debate, have one \nvote on final passage and be done with it.\n  I will say this because there is another Member of the minority here. \nI have another amendment that I have repeatedly tried to lay down. All \nit does is say with regard to the temporary worker program that before \nthat program actually starts, the mechanisms be in place for it to \nwork. The experts say that it takes about 18 months. You can start \ngetting ready for it. You can put those mechanisms in place, and the \nminute they are ready, the program can start.\n  You might disagree with the amendment, but it is not an unreasonable \namendment. There are a lot of folks who say: How can we trust you to \nhave a workable program? And the answer is, watch us. We will create \nit. The sooner it is ready, you can start your program. That is the \nkind of thing we are talking about. I don't think they are \nunreasonable.\n  I appreciate the indulgence of my colleagues, but I wanted to clear \nup some things. You can't finish the voting until you start the voting. \nWe need to start it. There are legitimate amendments. Nobody is \nfilibustering.\n  Let us get on with the process so that we can conclude this important \npiece of legislation, get the bill to the House of Representatives, and \nhopefully be able to say at the end of this year that we were able to \ntackle and to successfully resolve the most difficult issue \ndomestically facing this country today, the problem of illegal \nimmigration.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  While the Senator from Maryland is present, allow me to congratulate \nher on her Lady Terps who in the first half didn't look like they were \ngoing to pull it out but came back like the champs they are.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I also have been working on a terrorist \nvisa amendment. I call up that amendment, No. 3216, for consideration.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I object on behalf of the minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am very disappointed we cannot get that amendment up. I \nhave been working now for some time to get that amendment to move \nforward. It is an amendment I filed last week. It is a simple, \ncommonsense amendment that denies visas to advocates of terrorism. \nYesterday morning, I came to the Senate to speak on that amendment and \nasked for a vote.\n  Now, more than 24 hours later, we have still not had a vote on my \nsimple, 14-line amendment. It is just one example of the Democrats \ncontinued obstruction of well intentioned efforts to debate and make \nimprovements to the immigration bill.\n  Put simply, the Democrats are denying me a vote on my proposal to \ndeny visas to terrorists. Any Democrat who says this is anything other \nthan partisan obstructionism are themselves in denial.\n  To demonstrate the height to which this obstructionism has risen, I \nam again going to explain what my amendment does and how simple it \nreally is.\n  My amendment is so simple, in fact, that it adds only 6 words to the \nentire Immigration and Nationality Act. And half of those are the word \n``or.'' The other three are ``advocate,'' ``advocates,'' and \n``advocated.''\n  These 6 words are narrowly targeted to address a loophole in our \ncurrent visa system that is evidenced by the following statement:\n  Colleagues, believe it or not, this a heading from our very own \nDepartment of State Foreign Affairs Manual. The same Foreign Affairs \nManual issued to the Department's 25,000 employees located in more than \n250 posts or missions worldwide.\n  Even more alarmingly, this is from the chapter that instructs our \nconsular officers to whom visas should be issued. Visas are, of course, \nthe ticket that foreigners, including terrorists, need to enter the \nU.S.\n  This instruction says to the consular officer deciding whether or not \nto issue a visa that they need not deny a visa to an individual who \nadvocates terrorism. I, for one, cannot imagine a more pertinent ground \nfor denial. If advocacy of terrorism is not grounds for exclusion, I \ndon't know what is.\n  Not only am I concerned about the message this sends to our dedicated \nconsular officers, I am just as concerned about the message this sends \nto terrorists. It says to them, feel free to lay the groundwork for an \nattack at home, apply for a visa, and come to America to finish the \njob. This is not the message that the U.S. should be conveying to \nterrorists.\n  This Congress has already passed important legislation denying visas \nto terrorists, including in the PATRIOT and REAL ID Acts. The REAL ID \nAct, signed into law on May 11, 2005, specifically states that one who \nendorses or espouses terrorist activity is inadmissible.\n  The real REAL ID Act became public law on May 11 of last year, 8 days \nafter publication of this manual. Yet, today, more 10 months later, the \nState Department is still instructing its consular officers that \nadvocacy of terrorism may not be a ground for exclusion.\n  Clearly, the State Department needs to be sent a message that we, in \nCongress, are serious about securing our borders. And particularly \nserious about preventing known advocates of terrorism--people who are \nmost likely to wish harm to our country--from entering into the United \nStates.\n  Admittance to the United States is a privilege, not a right. My \namendment says, if you advocate terrorism, you lose the privilege of \ncoming to the United States.\n  I would like the opportunity to debate this amendment. I, for one, am \ncurious to hear from the Democrats their reason for opposing it.\n  It is a common sense amendment worthy of debate and a vote. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in calling for a vote on this legislation that \nslams the door shut in the face of advocates of terrorism who seek to \nenter our country.\n  I also submitted a second amendment last week which I believe is \nanother commonsense amendment to improve the immigration bill.\n  My amendment No. 3213 calls upon the administration to develop a plan \nfor securing the borders to curb the inflow of vast quantities of \nmethamphetamine into this country.\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\n  Our Nation has been hard hit by the illegal trafficking of \nmethamphetamine. My home State of Colorado is no exception. In just 10 \nyears, methamphetamine has become America's worst drug problem--worse \nthan marijuana, cocaine or heroin.\n  According to estimates from the DEA, an alarming 80 percent of the \nmethamphetamine used in the United States comes from larger labs, \nincreasingly abroad, while only 20 percent of the methamphetamine \nconsumed in this country comes from the small laboratories.\n  Therefore, my simple amendment calls for a formal plan that outlines \nthe diplomatic, law enforcement, and other procedures that the Federal \nGovernment will implement to reduce the amount of methamphetamine being \ntrafficked into the United States.\n  My amendment aims to build upon the methamphetamine provisions of the \nPATRIOT Act. We must impress upon the Secretary of State, the Attorney \nGeneral, and the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security the \nimmediate need for a firm plan of action. It is imperative that such a \nplan include, at a minimum, a specific timeline to reduce the inflow of \nmethamphetamine into the United States.\n  There must be a tough standard for keeping excessive amounts of \npseudophedrine products out of the hands of methamphetamine \ntraffickers. We must outline a specific plan to engage the top five \nexporters of methamphetamine precursor chemicals. It is important that \nwe protect our borders to ensure national security and the safety of \nour communities.\n\n  Now, here we are today, 1 week to the day after filing my \nmethamphetamine amendment, and still there has been no opportunity for \na debate, much less a vote. I urge my colleagues from across the aisle \nto allow us to proceed on this and other amendments worthy of debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield for a question from the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \nleadership on this issue. I do not know if he saw the program \n``Frontline'' recently, but it talked about the methamphetamine scourge \nthat is affecting the United States and the fact that now more of this \nillicit drug is coming in from Mexico. It is a serious, serious \nproblem. I congratulate him for addressing this problem.\n  I hope he understands that when we offered to call his amendment, \nasked for unanimous consent to call his amendment and adopt his \namendment, there was objection on his side of the aisle. We stand ready \nat this moment to call your amendment for a vote and to adopt it \nimmediately. I think it is a very important amendment, and it is one of \nthose that was on the agreed list and, unfortunately, a Member on your \nside objected to it. So I hope we can get to it soon. I thank the \nSenator for his leadership on this amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand negotiations are going on \nbetween the leadership in both parties, and my understanding is the \nmethamphetamine amendment may very well be included in a managers' \namendment and we will not have to be necessarily voting on that \nparticular amendment.\n  There is a second amendment, though, that is very important we do \nbring up for a vote. I know this is also being discussed by the \nleadership. That is the one which states that advocates of terrorism be \ndenied a visa.\n  I have two amendments. My hope is we can get that particular \namendment up for a vote. It is the one I just recently asked for a vote \non and was denied by your side. But I also understand the leadership on \nboth sides are negotiating. I understand they are negotiating \nseriously. So I appreciate the fact it is being considered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question \nor comment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will just say that we believe the underlying bill, the \nSpecter substitute bill, has very strong language to make it clear we \ndo not want anyone in the United States associated with terrorism. We \ncertainly do not want anyone in the United States associated with \nterrorism to reach legal status. That is reprehensible.\n  So I am prepared to offer to work with the Senator from Colorado on \nhis amendment to make sure we have included that category with which he \nis most concerned. I thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nindicating support for that. I just think we need to go and get more \nspecific language in the bill that we will be considering and, \nhopefully, will be reported off the floor of the Senate. I am just \ntrying to address that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3420\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment to the \nunderlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3420 to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 3192.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3421 to Amendment No. 3420\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-\ndegree amendment to the Sessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3421 to amendment No. 3420.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the last hour or two on the floor of \nthe Senate there has been a procedural move by some Senators on the \nother side of the aisle which reduces the likelihood of a compromise on \nthe immigration bill. I sincerely hope it doesn't end this effort \nbecause I think there are people of good faith on both sides of the \naisle still trying to find a way to pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I want to give special credit on the Republican side of the aisle to \nSenator Martinez, who I believe is working as hard as any person can to \nfind the right language that preserves the basic principles of the \nSpecter substitute, the bipartisan bill which passed the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I hope he is successful. But there is a deadline \nlooming and that deadline is a vote tomorrow morning on a motion for \ncloture.\n  Cloture is a procedure in the Senate which closes down debate and \nsays we will limit the number of amendments that may be considered in \nthe 30 hours after cloture is voted favorably. I am hoping that before \ntomorrow morning people of good will, trying to find a way to break \nthis deadlock, will be able to do so. But the procedural effort by \nSenator Kyl a few minutes ago is going to make that a little more \ndifficult. I still think we can achieve that goal.\n  I also want to address a couple of comments made by the junior \nSenator from Arizona on the floor concerning the history of this bill \nand the process that led to this day. This last Sunday I was on a talk \nshow, ``Face The Nation,'' with Chairman James Sensenbrenner of \nWisconsin, the chairman of\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\nthe House Judiciary Committee. He is the author of the House \nimmigration bill which passed in December. That bill includes very \nserious criminal penalties for those who are living in the United \nStates undocumented, who may number as many as 11 or 12 million people. \nIt also includes very serious criminal penalties for those who would \nhelp them reside in the United States if they are undocumented.\n  The charge under the Sensenbrenner bill is aggravated felony. It is \nthe same charge leveled at someone accused of being a rapist. It is an \nextremely serious criminal charge, and the Sensenbrenner bill which \npassed the House includes this aggravated felony charge.\n  Most people across America believe the House bill has gone way too \nfar in charging so many people who are in the United States with such a \nserious crime. On the floor it has been said by the Senator from \nArizona that there was an effort to reduce that penalty to a \nmisdemeanor on the floor of the House and that unfortunately the \nDemocrats did not support that effort. It is true that 190 Democrats \ndid not support that effort because they do not favor a criminal \npenalty for those who are here in an undocumented status. So ultimately \nthe majority party in the House, the Republican Party, prevailed and \nthe bill came to us with an aggravated felony as a charge against those \nwho are here undocumented and those who help them.\n  What it means in the real world is that people of faith who are \nvolunteers at soup kitchens or shelters for homeless people and those \nwho are victims of domestic violence, volunteers who help children of \nthe undocumented, tutoring them for classes, helping them in their \nlives, coaching their teams, nurses who provide volunteer assistance at \nclinics that treat the undocumented in the city of Chicago and around \nthe United States, would be subject to a felony charge under the \nSensenbrenner bill.\n  Senator Specter came to the Senate Judiciary Committee and offered an \nalternative. His alternative reduced the criminal charge to a \nmisdemeanor. We brought that up for a vote in the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and I am glad that on a bipartisan basis we removed the \ncriminal penalty that was in the original bill. I think that was a \npositive step forward.\n  The Senator from Arizona, who has raised this question, did not \nsupport our efforts to remove criminalization from the Specter bill, \nbut the bill as it comes to the floor, thankfully, does not include \ncriminalization. I hope that is the end of that issue as to whether we \nare going to charge Good Samaritans with a misdemeanor or a felony for \nhelping needy people across America. I hope it is not revived as one of \nthe concepts in this immigration reform.\n  The junior Senator from Arizona, Senator Kyl, also raised questions \nabout whether people who were guilty of a crime should be allowed to \nbecome legal in America or citizens in America. We tried to be very \nexpress in our statement in the bill, the Specter substitute, which was \ndrafted originally by Senators McCain and Kennedy on a bipartisan \nbasis, that if you are guilty of a crime we don't want you as an \nAmerican. We understand you have done something in your life which \ndisqualifies you from what we are going to offer you, a long and \nserious opportunity to find a pathway to legalization and citizenship.\n  Under the Judiciary Committee bill, the Specter bill as reported, the \nfollowing is a partial list of crimes that make an individual \nineligible for legalization. I read this list because there have been \nsuggestions on the floor by the Senator from Arizona that we are not \nserious about this. Let me tell you expressly the crimes that would \ndisqualify you from ever becoming a legal resident of America or a \ncitizen under this bill: Crimes of moral turpitude such as aggravated \nassault, assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated DUI, fraud, larceny, \nforgery; controlled substances offenses--sale, possession, distribution \nof drugs and drug trafficking; theft offenses, including shoplifting; \npublic nuisances; multiple criminal convictions. Any alien convicted of \ntwo or more offenses, regardless of whether the offense arose from a \nsingle scheme of misconduct and regardless of whether the offenses \ninvolved moral turpitude, for which the aggregate sentences to \nconfinement were 5 years or more, crimes of violence, counterfeiting, \nbribery, perjury, certain aliens involved in serious criminal activity \nwho have asserted immunity from prosecution, foreign government \nofficials who have committed particularly severe violations of \nreligious freedom, significant traffickers of persons, money \nlaundering, murder, rape, sexual abuse of a minor, possession of \nexplosives, child pornography, attempts or conspiracies to commit most \nof these offenses--and there are some security-related crimes that make \na person ineligible as well, espionage or sabotage--engaging in \nterrorist activity.\n  The reason I make special note of that is there have been references \nseveral times on the floor by the Senator from Arizona to Mohamed Atta, \nthe fact he was a terrorist, a man who was responsible in large part \nfor the tragedy of 9/11. Make no mistake, that bill would not give him \nan opportunity to become a citizen of the United States. Why in the \nworld would we ever consider that? I am sure the Senators from both \nsides of the aisle who supported the bill would never, ever consider \nthat possibility.\n  Those who were associated with terrorist activities, representatives \nof a terrorist organization, spouse or child of an individual who is \ninadmissible as a terrorist, activity that is deemed to have adverse \nforeign policy consequences, and those who are members in a \ntotalitarian party.\n  We have cast the net far and wide to disqualify people from even \nbeing considered for legal status in this country if they have been \nguilty of this type of conduct.\n  So though the Senator from Arizona and I may disagree on some other \naspects of the bill, when it comes to criminal activity I think we are \nin agreement. Criminal activity is going to disqualify you from being \nconsidered for legalization in the United States. That is a tough \nstandard, but it is the right standard and I hope we can make it clear \nduring the course of this debate that we believe it is important to \nmaintain in the bill and that the amendment of Senator Kyl does not add \nanything, really, remarkably, to this criminal disqualification.\n  The bill which passed out of committee, of course, sets up several \nthings. First, it sets up an enforcement mechanism which is \nsubstantial, much like the amendment offered by Senator Sessions of \nAlabama in the committee. It adds 12,000 new agents to our Border \nPatrol, adds 1,000 investigators a year for the next 5 years--that was \nSenator Specter's amendment; new security perimeter, under Senator \nSpecter, virtual fence, tightened controls, exit/entry security system \nat all land borders and airports, construction of barriers for vehicles \nand mandating new roads where needed, fences, checkpoints, ports of \nentry, increased resources for transporting aliens, new criminal \npenalties for tunnels--that was a recommendation of Senators Feinstein \nand Kyl--new criminal penalties for evading immigration officers, by \nSenator Sessions--all of these amendments accepted, included in the \nbill in the enforcement section--new criminal penalties for money \nlaundering offered by Senator Sessions, accepted as part of this \nbipartisan bill.\n  There is an amendment on a comprehensive surveillance plan by Senator \nSpecter; and also, I should say, expanded smuggling efforts, improved \ninteragency cooperation on alien smuggling; increased document fraud \ndetection; biometric identifiers; expanded detention authority; and \nincreased detention facilities and beds.\n  We require the Department of Homeland Security to acquire 20 new \ndetention facilities to accommodate at least 10,000 detainees, a \nsuggestion by Senator Sessions which is part of this bill; expanded \nterrorist removal grounds; expanded aggravated felony definition; \nincreased Federal penalties for gangs; removal of those who have failed \nto depart; increased criminal sentences for repeat illegal entrants; \nnew removal grounds; passport fraud and fraud offenses as a ground for \nremoval; removal of criminals prior to release; new authority for State \nand local police to investigate, apprehend, arrest, detain, or transfer \naliens to Federal custody; immigration status in the NCIC database now \nbecomes an element that we require; we prohibit time limits on \nbackground collection; impose criminal penalties for aid for the\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\nundocumented; assistance to States to help prosecute and imprison \nundocumented criminal aliens; stronger employment verification \nprocedures; penalties for employers who hire undocumented aliens are \nincreased; additional worksite enforcement and fraud detection agents.\n  We add 10,000 new worksite enforcement agents, 2,000 every year for \nthe next 5 years, and 5,000 new fraud detection agents, 1,000 each year \nfor the next 5 years.\n  I read this lengthy list so the Record would be clear that we have \nmade serious efforts on a bipartisan basis to accept amendments even \nfrom those Senators who oppose the underlying bill so there is no \nquestion that we will have strong enforcement standards to secure our \nNation's borders, and to also say those employers who ignore the law \nwill be penalized and will be investigated so that they understand we \nare serious.\n  The reason, of course, I bring this up is the suggestion earlier that \nthis bill would not strengthen our borders. I think it does. I think it \nmakes a genuine effort on a bipartisan basis to deal with our broken \nborders.\n  It also says, however, that once in the United States, for the \nundocumented status we will give you a chance, a chance to work your \nway to citizenship. It is a long journey. It has many serious \nrequirements as you move toward that goal, and many people won't make \nit. Some will fail in the effort. But if you want to become legal in \nthe United States of America, you need a clean criminal record. And I \nspelled out here the crimes that would clearly disqualify you.\n  You must show you have been employed here since January of 2004. You \nmust remain continuously employed, pay approximately $2,000 in fines \nand fees, pass a security background check, pass a medical exam, learn \nEnglish, learn U.S. history, pay all your U.S. back taxes, and then if \nyou have met all nine requirements, you go to the back of the line. It \nis your turn after all of those who have applied through the legal \nprocesses which are currently available.\n  So those who argue this bill is amnesty and it is automatic, that it \nis a free ticket to citizenship overlook the obvious. These are \nstringent requirements. Many people will never meet them. Some will \ngive up. But those who are determined to become American citizens and a \npart of our country, determined to be legal in their residency, who \nwork hard and achieve it, if they keep their eye on the goal--and the \ngoal is after 11 years--will finally see that day when they can be \nsworn in as a citizen of the United States.\n  Tomorrow morning we are facing a very serious vote on cloture. There \nhave been a lot of arguments made on the floor as to whether the right \namendments have been called. We tried to bring additional amendments to \nthe floor in the last couple of days, unsuccessfully. There have been \ndisagreements about which amendments should be called and in what \norder.\n  I don't think history is going to long note or remember what order \nthe amendments were that were called before this bill is up for \ncloture. If the cloture vote fails tomorrow, if 60 Senators don't step \nforward to vote for it, sadly that could be the end of immigration \nreform for the entire year.\n  It is a very busy calendar we have in the Senate. It deals with \nthings that are of great urgency. When we return after the Easter \nrecess, we will have a supplemental appropriations bill for our troops \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a very high priority. The Defense \nauthorization bill will follow; then a string of appropriations bills \nthat need to be enacted before we take our 4th of July break.\n  There is a lot to be done. I am hoping we can get it all done. But \nthe thought that we can carve out another week or two to return to \nimmigration at a later date may be fanciful. I am not sure we can \nachieve that. This is the moment.\n  Tomorrow many Senators will come to the floor and decide whether they \nwill be part of history, whether they will cast a vote for cloture \nwhich brings to the floor a definite deadline and timetable for \ndebating this comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n  It has been decades since we took this up seriously. We have spent a \nlot of time. We have a strong bipartisan bill. We have a bill that is \nsupported by business and labor groups across America, including many \nreligious groups that have come forward and encouraged us to do this in \nthe name of humanity and of American values.\n  Tomorrow, with this cloture vote we will have a chance to be on the \nRecord for time immemorial as to where we stand on this issue.\n  Some have already decided to oppose this bill. They are going to, \npostcloture. I understand that. But for those who think they can vote \nagainst cloture and argue they were for this bill, they may have a \ntough time describing that to the people back home.\n  I think about those I met this last week. I mentioned it earlier on \nthe floor. The students in the Catholic high school in Chicago are \nfollowing this debate every single day. They know their future is at \nstake. These are children who came to the United States at an early age \nbecause their parents decided to come here. They have lived here their \nentire lives. They have gone to school here, lived in the neighborhoods \nof America, and some have been extraordinary successes against great \nodds. Their life's dream is the same dream those children have, to be a \npart of America's future and do something good in their lives. They \nwill be denied that opportunity if the DREAM Act, which is part of this \nbill, does not pass. They will be illegal and undocumented. If the \nlegal system catches up with them, it will tell them to return to a \ncountry they cannot even remember. If it doesn't catch up to them, they \nwill continue to reside in the United States in undocumented and \nillegal status, unable to get a driver's license in many States, unable \nto be approved to be teachers and licensed to contribute to America, \nunable to secure the important jobs that can make a difference in our \nfuture. Their fate is tied to this bill.\n  Those who vote against cloture tomorrow have basically said we don't \nneed them; that we don't need to pass the DREAM Act; that these \nchildren and their fate and their future is none of our business. I \nthink it is.\n  I think these young people, some of whom I was with this last \nSaturday, are amazing. They have overcome the odds. They want to \ncontribute, have the chance every kid in America wants, to prove \nthemselves and have an opportunity to show they are worthy of American \ncitizenship. Why do we turn them down? Wouldn't we want to make certain \nthey have that chance? A vote for cloture tomorrow is going to give \nthem that chance. A vote against cloture will not.\n  There are many who will argue that they are against this bill. I hope \nother amendments will be offered.\n  Senator Kennedy came to the floor earlier and said if you don't like \nthis bill, vote for cloture. Close down the amendments that can be \noffered, limit the amount of debate and then vote against the bill, if \nthat is your wish. But give us a chance.\n  Tomorrow morning we will be asking for that chance from 60 Members of \nthe Senate which is necessary for that cloture motion to prevail.\n  Senator Kyl suggested that the only way to move forward to a vote on \nthis comprehensive package and the amendments is if his amendment is \nvoted on first. Senator Kyl was in discussion with me this morning and \nacknowledged that we need to sit down and make some important changes \nto the amendment which is presently before us. There are some parts \nthat are vague and uncertain. Lives hang in the balance.\n  I tried to make it clear to Senator Kyl there are ways he can use his \nown language that he used in previous bills and tighten up the language \nin his bill so there is no uncertainty and less vagueness. I am \nprepared to sit down with him and the staff. I tried to reach him \nduring the course of the day. I know he is very busy. If he wants to \nwork to bring the language together on this amendment, I want to work \nwith him and hope we can find a way to strike some good language that \nmight be supported on both sides of the aisle.\n  I see the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on the floor. I \nwill not miss this opportunity to say while I have the floor that I \nrespect him very much for what he has done in the committee, the hard \nwork in committee which I am proud to be part of. I thank him for his \nhard work in bringing this bill to the floor. We have had a rocky\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nperiod of time during the amendment phase--not nearly as many \namendments as I would have liked to have seen called. But I hope after \nthe cloture vote tomorrow we can roll up our sleeves in the remaining \nperiod of time and do the right thing, pass the Specter substitute with \nsome key amendments and show that this Senate is dedicated to true, \ncomprehensive immigration reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I appreciate the contribution the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois has made to the Judiciary \nCommittee. When he says we have had a rocky time, he is a master of \nunderstatement.\n  Again, he didn't hear my comment, like earlier today in responding to \none of his questions. He was conversing. So I will repeat this one.\n  When the distinguished Senator from Illinois says we have had a rocky \ntime on the amendments, he is a master of understatement.\n  I share his hope, although not much expectation, that we will be able \nto complete action on this bill before we adjourn for the recess. The \nSenate is a phenomenal institution, smarter than any of its Members or \nthe composite of all of its Members--not that that would necessarily \ntake a whole lot. But the Senate has functioned for a long time as an \ninstitution where there seems to be a way to work through these issues \nultimately. If we cannot find that answer before we adjourn for the \nrecess, it is my hope we will find it shortly thereafter. This is an \nissue and a problem which has to be addressed and has to be solved.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n426 are printed in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it appears conclusively at this point \nthat we are not going to make any--I was about to say any more \nprogress. I can't say that because that suggests there has been some \nprogress. We can't make any progress on the immigration reform bill, so \nthat my colleagues will be aware that nothing further will happen on \nthat bill for the remainder of the evening. Hopefully, we can make some \nprogress overnight and in the morning on the proposed compromises so we \ncan have a fruitful day tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his good \nwork in producing a bill that has become the subject of debate in the \nSenate dealing with a very important issue to our Nation, something \nthat people are extremely engaged in, one that has generated a lot of \ndebate and a lot of controversy around the country but clearly one that \nneeds to be addressed.\n  I have listened and observed as the debate has gone forward and \nlistened to the content of that debate over the past several days and \ncome to somewhat of an objective point of view because I come from a \nState that is not a border State. We do not have to deal with the \nissues on a daily basis affecting many of our States on the northern or \nsouthern border.\n  Having said that, it is an issue which has captured the discussion \nbeing held across this country even in States such as mine, the State \nof South Dakota. The reason for that is very simple: People see day in \nand day out some of the images broadcast across the television screen \nand the people who come to the United States illegally. They deal with \nthe burden and cost associated with some of the public services \nassociated with illegal immigration in this country. So they view it \nvery much as taxpayers. They view it as an issue that, frankly, needs \nto be addressed. They want to see the Senate act in an appropriate and \na timely way.\n  I have to say, too, I have heard a lot of people in the Senate \nreference their ancestry. Various Members of the Senate have described \nin detail how their ancestors came to this country, the personal \nperspective they have on the issue, and the experiences that have \nhelped shed light and inform their opinions about it. I, too, am not \nthe exception to that. I have roots that go back, with a grandfather \nthat came here from Norway, back in 1906, along with my great-uncle \nMatt, when they came through Ellis Island. The name that I now have, \nthe Thune name, was not their name. Their name was Gjelsvik. They came \nthrough Ellis Island and the immigration officials asked them to change \ntheir name because they thought it would be difficult for people in \nthese United States both to spell and pronounce. They did not speak a \nword of English. I should say, almost no English. My understanding is \nthat when they boarded the train that took them to South Dakota, the \nonly English they knew were the words ``apple pie'' and ``coffee.'' So \nthey had a lot of apple pie and coffee between Ellis Island and South \nDakota.\n  They came to this country for the same reason that people all over \nthe world come to this country. I am very sympathetic to those who want \nto come to the United States for everything that we stand for: for \nopportunity, for freedom, to live the American dream.\n  My grandfather and my great-uncle came here and worked on the \nrailroads when they were building the Transcontinental Railroad into \nSouth Dakota. They put their money together to start a merchandising \ncompany that later became Thune Hardware. So they were small business \npeople in this country, something that so many people aspire to all \nover the world. They want to come to the United States for the miracle \nand for the dream that is America.\n  I am sympathetic to the history and the culture and the tradition we \nhave as a nation of being a welcoming country, a country that says to \nbring your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. I \napproach the debate on immigration from that perspective, that context \nof having a grandfather, one generation removed from me, who came to \nthis country for all the various reasons that people today continue to \nwant to flock to America.\n  As I have listened to the debate, I have tried to give consideration \nto all the different perspectives that are presented. It seems to me, \nat least as I try to make decisions about this, formed by my \nconstituents in South Dakota and formed by my experience, background, \nand my history, to come to conclusions in the best interests of our \nNation, in the best interests of continuing that tradition of treating \nthose who come here fairly, but also the importance of American \nprinciples.\n  One of those American principles is the rule of law. We are a nation \nof laws, and that entails that we have to be able to enforce those \nlaws. If we cannot enforce those laws, if we are not going to apply and \nadhere to those laws, those laws end up being pretty meaningless and \nirrelevant in the long run. I come to this debate with some principles \nin mind, not having drawn any hard conclusions on any specific piece of \nlegislation but wanting to see the Senate do its work, wanting to see \nthe Senate do what the people in this country expect us to do, and that \nis to confront the big issues, to deal with the challenging issues, to \nvote on the big issues, to bring resolution and clarity to the problems \nand the challenges that face this country.\n  What is perplexing about what is happening in the Senate right now is \nwe have a base bill that has been reported out by the Judiciary \nCommittee. Granted, it may not be the perfect bill. Frankly, there are \nmany who would like to see that particular piece of legislation \namended. Many of us would like to vote on some of those types of \namendments that could be offered. Regrettably, the minority has decided \nthey are not going to allow votes on amendments, allegedly because they \nare votes they do not want to put their Members in precarious political \nsituations, having to make votes on amendments they would rather not \nvote on.\n  As a consequence, we are not having votes on amendments. We are just \nbasically blocking the whole substance of this debate from going \nforward and the Senate from doing the work that the American people \nexpect us to do and, frankly, what the tradition and history of the \nSenate would suggest that we ought to be doing; that is, amending this \nbase bill, having this debate, this discussion, allowing people with \ndifferent ideas and different perspectives and different points of view \nto come in and offer their amendments, to have those amendments \ndebated, to have\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\npeople listen to that debate, and then come and vote on those \namendments so that eventually we can produce a product that is the \ncomposite view of the Senate, reflective of a majority of the Senators.\n  What has happened in the Senate is the minority has decided, one, we \nare not going to vote on amendments. If we do have any votes on \namendments, they will dictate what those amendments are that we will \nvote on. So far as tomorrow, insisting on a cloture vote on the \nunderlying bill without having allowed any of the debate on any of the \namendments so that we have an opportunity for people to be heard, \npeople to offer their amendments, and people to improve, in their view, \nin their particular point of view, the legislation before it is \nultimately passed out of the Senate and goes to conference with the \nHouse and enacted into law.\n\n  The fundamental problem with the way the Senate is functioning in \nthis debate is that if we fail to allow individual Members to follow \nwhat is the protocol of the Senate, what is the tradition of the \nSenate, and that is the institution that allows for open debate, the \ninstitution that allows for amendments to be offered to legislation, \nfor individual Senators to come over and to have their point of view \nheard in that debate and offer amendments that are more reflective of \ntheir particular idea about how this problem ought to be addressed or \nthis challenge ought to be met, we are undermining the basic foundation \nof what this Senate and this institution is all about. But, more \nimportantly, we are keeping the people's business from being done.\n  We are, if we have this cloture vote tomorrow--and I suspect the \nminority will insist on this cloture vote because they want to have a \nvote on this bill without having any debate on any of the amendments \nthat our side wants to have votes on and report a bill out. You have \nthe minority of the Senate dictating the terms and conditions under \nwhich we will have this debate, the amendments that will be voted on, \nand, ultimately, the shape of the bill that will come out of here.\n  This side of the aisle, the majority, 55 Members of the Senate, want \nto be heard on this issue, as well. What we need to understand is, yes, \nthere are rules that allow the Senate to slow things down, to allow for \nextended debate on subjects, but ultimately we need to move the process \nforward. That means voting on legislation.\n  We had a big debate in the last couple of years about inaction in the \nSenate due to obstruction, due to blockage, due to dilatory tactics \nemployed by the minority. People have rejected that. People in this \ncountry want action. They want action on this specific issue. This is \nan issue that generates strong emotions all across the country.\n  Frankly, I believe the American people expect and they deserve better \nthan what they are getting from the minority in the Senate who have \ninsisted, again, that we not vote on amendments that the majority wants \nto offer. Basically, we report the bill out, they dictate the bill that \npasses the Senate.\n  That is not right. We have heard people get up on both sides today, \nboth Democrats and Republicans, and speak to this issue. We heard \nearlier today the Democrats get up and say: We are not really trying to \nblock this. We are willing to vote on amendments--our amendments, just \nnot your amendments, not amendments that are offered by the majority \nside in the Senate.\n  That is not to say they do not have some good ideas, but the truth \nis, there is not a monopoly on good ideas on either the Republican or \nDemocrat side, and this Senate ought to be allowed to work in the way \nit was intended to work. Republicans and Democrats can both offer their \namendments and they can both be voted on and we can shape the \nlegislation in a way that is reflective of the majority view in the \nSenate.\n  Tomorrow we will have a cloture vote. It will fail because the \nminority is going to insist we have a cloture vote. But no one on this \nside is going to allow the minority to dictate the terms of this debate \nor the amendments that ought to be considered or to block having votes \non amendments that the Republicans in the Senate would like to have \nvotes on.\n  As I said before, I tried to approach this debate in a very objective \nway and, frankly, as I look at it, there are some very critical \ncomponents that need to be in a bill. First and foremost, border \nsecurity. As I said earlier, one of the reasons that America stands \nunique in all the world is we are a nation of laws. We respect the rule \nof law. It means something in America.\n  There are other places in the world where the rule of law does not \nmean much, and tyrants and dictators come up with their own version of \nwhat the laws are. Here in the United States, we have a Constitution. \nWe are a constitutional Republic. We have laws. We abide by those laws. \nWe need to enforce those laws.\n  We have not been doing the job we need to be doing of enforcing our \nlaws with respect to the borders, controlling the borders in this \ncountry. That has all kinds of implications. This should not be lost on \nthe American people. One of the reasons people in South Dakota care \nabout this issue, even though we are not a border State is, they \nunderstand, as I do, that controlling and protecting and securing our \nborders is a matter of national security. Irrespective of where you \ncome from in the world, if you come to the United States--as I said \nearlier, I have Norwegian ancestry, but if you have Hispanic ancestry, \nEuropean ancestry, Asian ancestry, whatever--when the terrorists come \nacross the border like they did on September 11 to destroy and kill \nAmericans, they do not discriminate about where that individual comes \nfrom in the world. They want to kill Americans, pure and simple. I \ndon't care what your race or national origin, ethnicity is, flatly, \nvery simply, this is a matter of national security. And securing our \nborders has to be the fundamental component around which we build this \ndebate.\n  That is one of the principles I come to the debate with. Again, I \nhave no previous position as we enter this debate about individual \npieces of legislation. I am listening to it. I will have the \nopportunity, I hope, at some point, if the Democrats will allow us to, \nto vote on amendments. But the reality is right now we are not having \nthat opportunity. Again, I simply say that as a matter of principle, \nultimately we need to report a bill out of here that does secure the \nborders of the United States so that people in this country can know \nwith confidence and can trust that we are serious about keeping our \nborders secure if for no other reason than as a matter of national \nsecurity.\n  Secondly, I would say, as a fundamental principle, we have to enforce \nour laws. There has been a big debate about: What do you do about \npeople who are already here illegally? I think that is a very important \nquestion in this debate. There are somewhere between 11 and 12 million \npeople, we are told, who have come to this country who are now here \nillegally, and we have to figure out, from the standpoint of status, \nhow we deal with those people in this country.\n  But, again, a fundamental underlying principle ought to be that we \ncannot reward illegal behavior. We want to reward legal behavior. We \nwant to reward people who came here and who followed the rules. I heard \nlots of people get up and talk on the floor about their ancestry and \nhow they came to this country, but I suspect most of them, like my \ngrandfather and great-uncle, came here by the rules that were put in \nplace. They followed the law.\n  We want to encourage and provide incentives for that kind of \nbehavior. For people who want to come to America, we have a process by \nwhich they can come here, but it is consistent with a set of rules and \nlaws we have in place. We have to make sure we are encouraging legal \nbehavior, that we are discouraging illegal behavior, that we are not \nputting incentives in place for illegal behavior and, furthermore, \ncondoning or conferring benefits on people who systematically decide to \nbreak the law.\n  So I happen to be of a view that I believe in a guest, temporary \nworker program, perhaps some form of permanent resident status. But I \nthink, again, when you start talking about conferring the benefits of \ncitizenship on people in this country who are here illegally without \nsome sort of penalty for that--in other words, if we just wave our \nmagic wand and say anybody who is here can stay, and so be it, we have \ndone a disservice to our history and our traditions as a nation of \nlaws.\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\n  I think it is important we understand there needs to be consequences \nto illegal behavior. We have talked about amnesty. It has been thrown \naround a lot here. Essentially, what that means is there is no \nconsequence to behavior that is illegal. I think it is important we \nmake it fundamentally clear to people who do want to come to this \ncountry that we are a nation, yes, of immigrants, we welcome people, \nbut we want people to come here according to the laws.\n  I would say that at the end of day, when this is all said and done, \nagain, we need to have votes because this is an issue that around the \ncountry is generating tremendous heat, tremendous emotion, and has been \npercolating for some time. As people look at the images on their \ntelevision of people who come here illegally, they are worried about \nnational security, they are worried about the economic consequences, \nthe consequences to the taxpayer of providing services to people who \nare here illegally.\n  People want action. They want action by the U.S. Senate. I think we \nhave a responsibility, in this body, after everything is said and \ndone--and usually what happens in the Senate is more gets said than \ndone--but when everything is said and done, to come together on \nlegislation that would accomplish the goal; that is, to address the \nissue of immigration in a way that is fair and in a way that is \nconsistent with our culture and our history and our tradition as a \nwelcoming country but is also consistent with our tradition as a nation \nof laws. I believe we can come to that kind of a resolution here in the \nSenate if--if--our colleagues on the other side will allow us to vote \non amendments.\n  Now, the Senator from Georgia, who is currently the Presiding Officer \nin the Senate, has an amendment I would like to vote on. It is called \nthe trigger amendment. Basically, it says that until it is certified \nthat the borders are secure, then all these other issues we are talking \nabout with respect to this debate are just conversation; that, first \nand foremost, we have to secure the borders, and it has to be certified \nwe have made the efforts, that we are serious about doing that. I think \nit is a good approach. At least it ought to be an approach that is \nvoted on.\n  Now, our colleagues on the other side, the Democrats, do not want a \nvote on the amendment of the Senator from Georgia because they do not \nthink that would be a good political vote for them. What it suggests to \nme is we have colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are a lot \nmore concerned about having an issue, a political issue, than they are \nabout having a solution to this problem. What we need in the Senate are \nmore people on both sides, Republicans and Democrats, who will confront \nthis issue for what it is.\n  That is probably the most difficult, challenging issue that is facing \nthe country, on a domestic level at least, currently or for some time. \nWe are fighting a war on terror in Iraq. It has demanded a lot of \nattention and a tremendous amount of resources. But when it comes to \ndomestic issues--and there are many. I am very interested in this body \nworking on issues. As we move forward throughout the year, we have \nvotes scheduled on health care reform because health care costs are \ncritical. We have to get that under control in this country.\n\n  We are going to have votes on extending some of the tax relief that \nwill allow the economy to continue to grow and to create jobs and to \nmake sure the economic engines are keeping this country moving forward. \nWe are going to have votes on those types of issues as we go forward. \nAnd, of course, we are going to deal with the annual appropriations and \nbudget process, and a whole range of other issues before the year is \nout.\n  They are important issues. They are all important to the American \npublic. But I would submit to you that right now there is no more \nurgent issue, no issue that demands an answer, that demands a solution, \nthat demands action by the Senate than the issue of immigration.\n  And what is the Senate going to do? Are we going to move forward? Are \nwe going to, consistent with the tradition and the history of the \nSenate, allow for debate and allow for votes on amendments or are the \nDemocrats, the minority in the Senate, going to continue to insist on \nblocking amendments, votes on amendments, simply because they do not \nwant to vote on certain amendments because those amendments might be \ntough political votes for them?\n  Well, we all make tough political votes. There are amendments they \nare going to offer that I will not want to vote on. In fact, there may \nbe some amendments offered by colleagues on my side of the aisle that I \nreally do not want to vote on. But we are here to vote. That is what \npeople send us here to do. It is to do the people's business.\n  It is important we have the opportunity to deal with what is the most \nimportant singular issue I think the American public is focused on \ntoday and that they want us to deal with. It is the responsibility of \nthe Senate to debate--allow for extended debate--to consider \namendments, but ultimately to vote. That means voting on amendments \nthat are offered both by my colleagues on the Democratic side as well \nas my colleagues on the Republican side, even if they are amendments \nthat I may not want to vote on.\n  I have to say again, there are amendments I probably would rather not \nvote on, if I was thinking purely about the political consequences of \nsome of these votes. But the fact is, we are here to vote. We are here \nto do the people's business. It is high time we did it.\n  I encourage and I urge my colleagues on the Democratic side to join \nwith my colleagues on the Republican side in putting aside the \npolitics, putting aside the delaying tactics, putting aside the \nobstruction and the blocking of the agenda, and allow us to move \nforward to vote on amendments and to report out of the Senate a bill--\nand it may not be everything we want but allow this institution to act \nin the manner in which the people of this country expect us to act, \nand, frankly, in a way the American people deserve.\n  So I hope tomorrow will be the day we will break the logjam, that we \nwill be able to get a bill we can report that the Senate can take a \nfinal vote on but that is reflective of the majority views in the \nSenate, including an opportunity to vote on individual amendments and \nto move this debate and this process forward so we can get into \nconference with the House and shape a bill we can put on the \nPresident's desk that will send a loud, clear message to the American \npeople we are serious about border security, we are serious about our \nNation's history as a nation, a welcoming culture, a nation of \nimmigrants, but we are serious about enforcing the rule of law in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator yields back.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as a prelude, we have a number of requests \nand items of business to take care of. I will explain here shortly.\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. President, I move to commit the bill to the Judiciary Committee \nto report back forthwith with an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] moves to commit the \n     bill to the Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to \n     report back forthwith the following amendment No. 3424.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I now ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3425\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I send a first-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3425 to the instructions to the motion to \n     commit.\n\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the instructions, add the following \n     amendment:\n       This section shall become effective one (1) day after the \n     date of enactment.\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     motion to commit S. 2454, the Securing America's Borders Act.\n         Bill Frist, Arlen Specter, Michael B.

Parliamentary inquiry: Does this mean there are no other \namendments in order? I couldn't file another amendment now, could I?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is correct. At this moment in time, \nyou would not. If we were allowed to go ahead on the amendments, and \nonce we start disposing of the amendments, this is something that would \nbe in order.\n  Mr. REID. I was curious why we aren't able to offer any amendments at \nthis time, but we can talk about that tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the point is well made.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  I send a cloture motion to the underlying bill to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     376, S. 2454, a bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to provide for comprehensive reform, and for other \n     purposes.\n         Bill Frist, George Allen, Mitch McConnell, Pete Domenici, \n           R.F.

All right. Mr. President, what we have just done, so our \ncolleagues will understand, is as follows: Tomorrow morning, \nnotwithstanding the fact we have yet to vote on even the very first \namendment offered, we will have a cloture vote that--\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have adopted three.\n  Mr. FRIST. I will stand corrected. No, I will not stand corrected. On \nthe very first amendment that was offered we still have not had a vote. \nAnd, yes, there have been several other amendments that have been \naddressed. We will have a cloture vote, which was filed by the minority \nleader, on the underlying Specter substitute amendment, and that will \nbe the first vote tomorrow morning.\n  I suspect that cloture vote will fail. And we have been very clear \nabout our desire on this side to consider amendments from Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle and our willingness for votes. We discussed \nthat over the course of the day. It appears that this will not be \nlikely and, therefore, we will be prevented from making any real \nprogress on the bill.\n  So moments ago I offered a motion to commit, which incorporates an \namendment by Senators Hagel and Martinez and others who have been \nworking on this amendment over the course of the day. The fact that \nthose cloture motions were filed tonight means that we would have the \ncloture vote on that motion on Friday. And depending on the outcome of \nthat cloture motion, we could have a second cloture vote on the \nunderlying bill, the so-called Frist bill, as well.\n  So we will have the Specter cloture vote tomorrow morning, and then \none or possibly two other cloture votes on Friday morning.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, through the Chair to the distinguished \nmajority leader, I would hope, the amendment--we have a general idea \nwhat it is about--I would hope this amendment is one, as it has been \nrelated to me, that is such that it improves the underlying Specter \nsubstitute, that it deals with only the legalization process.\n  I would hope, after Senators and staff pursue that amendment in \ndetail tonight, that it is something we could all support and move on \nto completing the bill as soon as germane amendments were offered and \ndebated and voted upon.\n  It would be great if we could end this very acrimonious week on a \nhigh note. And we will not know that until we study this amendment. We \nare hearing of a lot of things that are in it and not in it. So time \nwill only tell.\n  I would say, through the Chair to the majority leader, because we \nhave already had phone calls in the last half hour or so from \nSenators--they have asked me, as the distinguished majority leader did \nearlier today, if I would agree to earlier cloture votes. I do not know \nwhat the pleasure is of the Senator from Tennessee, if you want to wait \nuntil Friday, or you want to try to complete this tomorrow.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, through the Chair--and we had discussed the \npossibility of that a little earlier--I think it is best for us to make \nthat decision tomorrow, only because the Hagel-Martinez amendment is a \nnegotiated compromise amendment that none of our colleagues have had \nthe opportunity to really see yet.\n  I have had numerous phone calls over the course of tonight as well. I \nthink it is important people have the opportunity to look at that \ncarefully tomorrow and see how much time it takes for people to have \nboth the opportunity to look at it themselves, as well as their staff. \nWe ought to keep that potential on the table.\n  Mr. REID. So unless there is some agreement, the two cloture votes \nwould begin occurring an hour after we come in on Friday.\n  Mr. FRIST. Through the Chair, that is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is that right, I say to the Chair?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. There may be some other cloture motions to consider on \nFriday, which I will come to here shortly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2896-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2896-S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1086\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

I ask unanimous consent that the committee-\nreported amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, Senator \nKennedy and other Senators have been told prior to this piece of \nlegislation passing there would be a vote on hate crimes legislation \nthat has been in this body for a long time.\n  I would hope--and it is my understanding the chairman of the \ncommittee had worked this out with Senator Kennedy--we could, at an \nearly date, I mean in a matter of hours, work this out. This sex \noffender registry is\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\nan important piece of legislation. But also, as we have learned here in \nthe Senate, people keeping their word is also important. I am confident \nit was some kind of a misunderstanding. I am hopeful that is the case. \nBut until Senator Kennedy and others and Senator Specter work this out, \nI must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, just a moment of explanation because I \nthink this bill is, in substance, broadly supported. I am disappointed \nto hear the objections tonight.\n  Let me comment very briefly on the bill because it is an issue that I \nthink this body does feel strongly about and that we need to move \nforward on because it can make a difference. This particular bill is \nchild predator legislation, and we all need to be working together to \nkeep our children safe from child predators. American families, as we \nall know, should not have to live in fear of sexual predators lurking \nin neighborhoods and enticing our children.\n  In the last 24 hours, we have all seen--actually here in the Senate \nand in this town--we have learned some shocking and tragic news about \nthe growing problem of online child pornography. The abuse of the \nInternet has really, unfortunately, become the gateway to more serious \nviolent sex offenses against both children and adults.\n  On Tuesday night, we learned of the arrest of another online child \npredator and the tragic plight of a child predator victim. The predator \nwas an official from the Department of Homeland Security who was \narrested for seducing a child over the Internet. Allegedly, this \nindividual initiated a sexually explicit online chat with a detective \nposing as a 14-year-old girl. He allegedly described in graphic detail \nthe sexual acts he wanted to perform with her and offered to exchange \nsexually explicit photos. Fortunately, law enforcement intercepted this \nindividual before he could victimize an innocent child.\n  But for too many innocent children, the child predators are not \ncaught until it is too late. Yesterday we also heard from one of the \nvictims: 19-year-old Justin Berry from California who courageously \ntestified before a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on \nsexual exploitation of children over the internet. For 5 five years, \nJustin was the victim of an online child pornography ring. At 13, this \nlonely teenager innocently hooked up a web camera to his computer, \nhoping to meet other teenagers online. Instead, he heard only from \nadult child predators who struck up friendly chats and offered him \ncompliments and gifts. One day, one predator offered to pay him $50 to \ntake off his shirt in front of the webcam. Eventually, these predators \nlured him into performing pornographic acts in front of the webcam for \nan audience that grew to more than 1,500 people who paid him hundreds \nof thousands of dollars.\n  These shocking stories are not isolated incidents. They are \nsymptomatic of a larger problem.\n  I believe we should seize this opportunity to transform these \ntragedies into positive action.\n  The bill I called up tonight--S. 1086, the Sex Offender Registration \nand Notification Act--would help protect our kids against child \npredators. It was introduced by Senator Hatch. It has 33 bipartisan \ncosponsors. It was reported unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. It is supported by the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Boys and Girls \nClub of America, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and \nthe National District Attorneys Association. And it is supported by the \nfamilies of child predator victims.\n  Among its many provisions, the bill will create a national sex \noffender registry accessible on the Internet and searchable by zip \ncode;\n  Require convicted sex offenders to register, including child \npredators who use the Internet to commit a crime against a minor;\n  Make failure to register a felony;\n  Encourage information sharing among local, State and Federal law \nenforcement; and\n  Toughen criminal penalties for violent crimes against children under \n12.\n  Here in the Senate, we need to act to address this issue. In light of \nthe events this week, we should not delay. We should act now before \nanother innocent child becomes a victim of a child predator.\n  It is an issue we do need to address, and I believe it will pass in \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan way. In light of the events of this week, \nwe should not be delaying it any longer. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on the other side in getting this bill passed as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very briefly, if the distinguished majority \nleader will yield, Democrats support the concept of a national \nregistry. It is important. But we also support the concept that people \nwho are injured, maimed, or murdered as a result of hate crimes also \ndeserve protection. We hope we can do all this at one time. I am \nhopeful and confident that can happen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2897-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF BENJAMIN A.

She received the Distinguished \nPublic Service Medal in recognition of her outstanding performance of \nduty in this important office.\n  She also served as vice president of the Heritage Foundation, \npresident of the Philadelphia Society, and was a member of the board of \nthe Marine Corps University in Quantico and the Washington Home \nHospice.\n  She is survived by her husband of 45 years, Miles; and two children, \nMary ``Nisi'' Hamilton of Bethesda and Tristram Coffin Carlisle of \nAlexandria.

Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators Specter, \nKohl, DeWine and others on a new bill, the Oil and Gas Industry \nAntitrust Act of 2006, which includes, as its centerpiece, our NOPEC \nlegislation, which many of us have worked together on for years.\n  This measure--The No Oil Producing And Exporting Cartels Act, NOPEC--\nwould make OPEC accountable for its anticompetitive behavior and allow \nthe Justice Department to crack down on illegal price manipulation by \noil cartels. It will allow the Federal Government to take legal action \nagainst any foreign state, including members of OPEC, for price fixing \nand other anticompetitive activities. The tools this bill would provide \nto law enforcement agencies are necessary to immediately counter OPEC's \nanticompetitive practices, and these tools would help reduce gasoline \nprices now.\n  The Congress should pass this measure immediately instead of waiting \nuntil the price of gasoline at the pump is $4 a gallon. OPEC has \nAmerica over a barrel, and we should fight back. If OPEC were simply a \nforeign business engaged in this type of behavior, it would already be \nsubject to American antitrust law. It is wrong to let OPEC producers \noff the hook just because their anticompetitive practices come with the \nseal of approval of this cartel's member nations.\n  It is time for the President to join the bipartisan majority in the \nSenate which already said ``NO'' to OPEC by passing NOPEC and by \nsending it to the other body, where it was killed.\n  The Senate has already passed this bill, which would make OPEC \nsubject to our antitrust laws. In fact, the Judiciary Committee has \napproved the NOPEC bill three times. Regrettably, even though President \nBush promised in 2000 that he would ``jawbone OPEC,'' the Bush \nadministration and its friends in the House have scuttled the NOPEC \nbill and the direct and daily relief it would bring to millions of \nAmericans.\n  In addition, this bill makes it unlawful to divert petroleum or \nnatural gas products from their local market to a distant market with \nthe primary intention of increasing prices or creating a shortage in a \nmarket. This solves a real problem where products are being shipped for \nsale in that market but are later diverted and sold for less in another \nmarket.\n  We have an obligation to address these and other issues caused by oil \ncartels and by greedy companies who have money--that they have \nextracted from the American people--to burn. That is why I am also \npleased that the bill includes provisions to conduct several studies \nthat address serious competition, information sharing, and other \nantitrust problem areas related to the oil and natural gas industries. \nThe American people deserve answers, and this bill also provides a path \nto getting those answers.\n  Authorizing tough legal action against illegal oil price fixing, and \ntaking that action without delay, is one thing we can do without \nadditional obstruction or delay.\n  The artificial pricing scheme enforced by OPEC affects all of us, not \nthe least of whom are hardworking Vermont farmers. The overall increase \nin fuel costs for an average Vermont farmer last year was 43 percent, \nmeaning that each farmer is estimated to pay an additional $700 in fuel \nsurcharges in 2006 alone. Vermonters know what the terrible \nconsequences of these high prices can be: forcing many farmers to make \nunfair choices between running their farms or heating their homes. No \none should be forced to make these choices, certainly not our hard-\nworking farmers.\n  In summary, this bill will provide law enforcement with the tools \nnecessary to fight OPEC's anticompetitive practices immediately, and \nhelp reduce gasoline prices now. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill, and to say ``NO'' to OPEC as we have done in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2898-6", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2898-S2899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NOMINATION OF MICHAEL A.

No matter \none's political persuasion, we all take pride in the honor that has \nbeen bestowed on a fellow New Jerseyan.\n  Mr. Chagares is a New Jersey native who graduated from Gettysburg \nCollege and Seton Hall School of Law, with honors.

Over the past 15 \nyears, Mr. Chagares has served the public with distinction in the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of New Jersey and has also worked in \nprivate practice.\n  In addition, he is a popular Professor of both appellate advocacy and \ncivil trial practice at Seton Hall. I believe this popularity is a \ntestament to his ability to both convey the essence of the subject \nmatter and do it in a way that excites a new generation of lawyers.\n  The American Bar Association has rated Mr. Chagares as ``well \nqualified'' for the position that he has been nominated. It is a view \nthat I share as well.\n  I am pleased that see that people of his quality are willing to serve \nour Nation in the administration of justice, and join Senator \nLautenberg in commending him to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Mr. \nChagares to be a judge on our Nation's Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2899-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO LEE HUMPHREY AND COREY BREWER\n\n Mr. ALEXANDER.

None of those teams \nmade it all the way to the championship, but two Tennesseans who play \nfor the University of Florida did. I want to congratulate them, \nespecially since one is from my hometown, Maryville.\n  Lee Humphrey was Tennessee's Class AAA Mr. Basketball when he \nattended Maryville High School. He is the school's all-time leader in \npoints and steals. His dad, Tony, a middle school teacher in Maryville, \nhad the key to the gym. And on many nights, Lee and his dad would go to \nthe gym and while Lee took shots his dad rebounded. Apparently, the \npractice paid off. Dick Vitale said that Lee was the ``X factor'' in \nthe Final Four. In the championship game he scored 15 points, making 4 \nof 8 shots from the field. Coincidentally, the game was played in the \ncurrent home stadium of Lee's boyhood idol, Peyton Manning.\n  Lee's teammate Corey Brewer from Portland, TN, was 1 of 24 seniors \nnamed nationwide as a 2004 McDonald's All-American player. He scored \n29.4 points a game and averaged 12.8 rebounds his senior season at \nPortland High. He received a lot of honors that year, including being \nnamed grand marshal of Portland's Strawberry Festival. Corey has \ncredited his success to hard work in practice and a childhood spent \nplaying sports with his older brother Jason and Jason's friends. He is \na role model who returns to Portland and talks to elementary school \nkids, urging them to study and warning about the dangers of drugs. He \nfollows the lessons he learned from his mother, Glenda, a teacher.\n  Recruited for his tenacious defense as well as his scoring ability, \nCorey has been a big game player for the University of Florida all \nyear. In the championship game, he scored 11 points and grabbed 7 \nrebounds to go along with 4 assists and 3 steals.\n  Mr. President, we Tennesseans are proud of our State's basketball \nteams. We want them to win. But we are also proud of our young scholar-\nathletes who play for other teams. They are Tennesseans, too, and we \nwant them to know we are proud of their accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2899-2", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2899-3", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2899-4", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 5:06 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Croatt, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolutions, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to authorize grants to carry out projects to provide \neducation on preventing teen pregnancies, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, as we approach May, the National Month \nto Prevent Teen Pregnancy, I rise to introduce the Teen Pregnancy \nPrevention, Responsibility and Opportunity Act. This legislation will \nestablish a comprehensive program for reducing adolescent pregnancy \nthrough education and information programs, as well as positive \nactivities and role models both in and out of school.\n  As parents, there is nothing more important than protecting our \nchildren and giving them a future filled with hope and opportunity. As \nleaders, we also have a responsibility to our young people--to provide \nresources for communities, parents, and children to help them achieve \nthose goals. There are many ways we can provide parents with the tools \nthey need to help kids make responsible decisions and avoid destructive \nbehavior such as drug and alcohol abuse or sexual activity which can \nlead to unintended pregnancies.\n  The U.S. continues to have the highest teen pregnancy rate and teen \nbirth rate in the Western industrialized world. In a fiscal context, it \ncosts the U.S. at least $7 billion annually, and in a human context, \nthis impacts one third of all teenage girls. It is time to do something \nabout it.\n  Whi1e we have done a good job of progressively decreasing teen \npregnancy, we can do much better.\n  With the sons of teen mothers more likely to end up in prison, and \nthe daughters of teen mothers more likely to end up teen mothers \nthemselves, we must act now to break this problematic cycle.\n  Our schools, community and faith-based organizations need access to \nfunds to teach age-appropriate, factually and medically accurate, and \nscientifically-based family life education.\n  We need programs that encourage teens to delay sexual activity.\n  We need to provide services and interventions for sexually active \nteens.\n  We need to educate both young men and women about the \nresponsibilities and pressures that come along with parenting.\n  We need to help parents communicate with teens about sexuality.\n  We need to teach young people responsible decision making.\n  And, we need to fund after school programs that will enrich their \neducation, replace destructive behavior time with constructive \nactivities, and offer character and counseling services.\n  We know that after-school programs reduce risky adolescent behavior \nby involving teens in positive activities that also provide positive \nlife skills. Teenage girls who play sports, for instance, are more \nlikely to wait to become sexually active, and to have fewer partners. \nThey are consequently less likely to become pregnant.\n  Let us join together to recommit ourselves to continuing to decrease \nthe incidence of teen pregnancy, and recommit ourselves to offering \nfamily life education and positive after school programs that will \nfoster responsible young adults.\n  The time is now to invest in our teens. As all parents know, we place \noverwhelming pressure on ourselves to make sure we raise our children \nwell. Decisions we make--and they make--will affect them for the rest \nof their lives. We cannot afford to let the doors close on them. \nInstead we must continue to open the door of opportunity. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\n                                S. 2508\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teen Pregnancy Prevention, \n     Responsibility, and Opportunity Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The United States has the highest teen-pregnancy rate \n     and teen birth rate in the western industrialized world, \n     costing the United States not less than $7,000,000,000 \n     annually.\n       (2) About 1 out of 3 of all young women in the United \n     States becomes pregnant before she reaches the age of 20.\n       (3) Teen pregnancy has serious consequences for young \n     women, their children, and communities as a whole. Too-early \n     childbearing increases the likelihood that a young woman will \n     drop out of high school and that she and her child will live \n     in poverty.\n       (4) Statistically, the sons of teen mothers are more likely \n     to end up in prison. The daughters of teen mothers are more \n     likely to end up teen mothers too.\n       (5) Teens that grow up in disadvantaged economical, social, \n     and familial circumstances are more likely to engage in risky \n     behavior and have a child during adolescence.\n       (6) Teens with strong emotional attachments to their \n     parents are more likely to become sexually active at a later \n     age. 7 out of 10 teens say that they are prepared to listen \n     to things parents thought they were not ready to hear.\n       (7) 78 percent of white and 70 percent of African American \n     teenagers report that lack of communication between a teenage \n     girl and her parents is frequently a reason a teenage girl \n     has a baby.\n       (8) One study found that the likelihood of teens having sex \n     for the first time increased with the number of unsupervised \n     hours teens have during a week.\n       (9) After-school programs reduce teen risky behavior by \n     involving teens in activities that provide alternatives to \n     sex. Teenage girls who play sports, for instance, are more \n     likely to delay sex and have fewer partners and less likely \n     to become pregnant.\n       (10) After-school programs help prevent teen pregnancy by \n     advancing good decision-making skills and providing teens \n     health education and positive role models in a supervised \n     setting.\n       (11) 8 in 10 girls and 6 in 10 boys report that they wish \n     they had waited until they were older to have sex.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a collaborative program to protect the \nGreat Lakes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Great \nLakes Collaboration Implementation Act with my colleague, Senator \nLevin. I would like to thank him for all of his hard work on this \nlegislation and the Great Lakes.\n  The Great Lakes are a unique natural resource that need to be \nprotected for future generations. The Great Lakes hold one-fifth of the \nworld's surface freshwater, cover more than 94,000 square miles, and \ndrain more than twice as much land. Over thirty of the basin's \nbiological communities--and over 100 species--are globally rare or \nfound only in the Great Lakes basin. The 637 State parks in the region \naccommodate more than 250 million visitors each year. The Great Lakes \nare significant to the eight States and two Canadian provinces that \nborder them, as well as to the millions of other people around the \ncountry who fish, visit the surrounding parks, or use products that are \naffordably shipped to them via the lakes.\n  Unfortunately, the Great Lakes remain in a degraded state. A 2003 GAO\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\nreport said, ``Despite early success in improving conditions in the \nGreat Lakes Basin, significant environmental challenges remain, \nincluding increased threats from invasive species and cleanup of areas \ncontaminated with toxic substances that pose human health threats.'' \nMany scientists affirm that the Great Lakes are exhibiting signs of \nstress due to a combination of sources, including toxic contaminants, \ninvasive species, nutrient loading, shoreline and upland land use \nchanges, and hydrologic modifications. A 2005 report from a group of \nGreat Lakes scientific experts states that ``historical sources of \nstress have combined with new ones to reach a tipping point, the point \nat which ecosystem-level changes occur rapidly and unexpectedly, \nconfounding the traditional relationships between sources of stress and \nthe expected ecosystem response.''\n  One cannot see the many threats to the Lakes simply by looking at \nthem. The zebra mussel, an aquatic invasive species, causes $500 \nmillion per year in economic and environmental damage to the Great \nLakes. One study found that since 1990--the year that zebra mussels \nreally began to make an impact--Lake Michigan's yellow perch population \nhas decreased by about 80 percent. In 2000, seven people died after \npathogens entered the Walkerton, Ontario drinking water supply from the \nlakes. In May of 2004, more than ten billion gallons of raw sewage and \nstorm water were dumped into the Great Lakes. In that same year, over \n1,850 beaches in the Great Lakes were closed. Each summer, Lake Erie \ndevelops a 6,300 square mile dead zone. There is no appreciable natural \nreproduction of lake trout in the lower four lakes. More than half of \nthe Great Lakes region's original wetlands have been lost, along with \n60 percent of the forests. Wildlife habitat has been destroyed, thus \ndiminishing opportunities necessary for fishing, hunting and other \nforms of outdoor recreation.\n  For several years, I have been calling for a plan to restore the \nLakes and have been urging governors, mayors, environmental community \nand other regional interests to agree on a vision for the Great Lakes--\nnot just immediately, but for the long-term future.\n  Last year, over 1,500 people worked to draft a plan through a process \ncalled Great Lakes Regional Collaboration. The Collaboration strategy \nincludes dozens of recommendations for action at the federal, state, \nlocal, and tribal actions that will help restore the Great Lakes. \nSenator Carl Levin and I--as well as our colleagues in the House--have \ncrafted a bill to implement these recommendations.\n  This bill would reduce the threat of non-native species invading the \nGreat Lakes through ballast water and other pathways. The bill targets \nthe Asian carp by authorizing the Corps of Engineers to improve the \ndispersal barrier project and prohibiting the importation or interstate \ncommerce of live Asian carp.\n  The bill addresses threats to fish and wildlife habitat by \nreauthorizing the Great Lakes Fish & Wildlife Restoration Act, a \ncurrent program that provides grants to states and tribes.\n  The bill reauthorizes the State Revolving Loan Fund and provides $20 \nbillion over five years to assist communities with the critical task of \nupgrading and improving their wastewater infrastructure.\n  The bill authorizes $150 million per year for contaminated sediment \ncleanup at Areas of Concern under the Great Lakes Legacy program. It \nalso provides the EPA with greater flexibility in implementing the \nprogram by allowing the Great Lakes National Program Office to disburse \nfunds to the non-federal sponsor of a Legacy Act project.\n  The bill establishes a new grant program within EPA, called the Great \nLakes Mercury Product Stewardship Strategy Grant Program, to phase out \nmercury in products.\n  The bill improves existing research programs and fills the gap where \nwork is needed. We need baseline data to understand how the lakes are \nchanging and where improvements are succeeding.\n  The bill authorizes NOAA to restore and remediate waterfront areas. \nProjects will require a non-federal partner who will provide at least a \n35% cost-share. Individual projects may not cost more than $5 million.\n  Lastly, the bill establishes the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force \nand the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration process in order to \ncoordinate and improve Great Lakes programs.\n  Restoring the Great Lakes to a healthy ecosystem is not something \nthat will happen overnight. This is a long-term process, but Congress \nneeds to act now. Our bill is a major step in the right direction. We \nneed to continue to refocus and improve our efforts in order to reverse \nthe trend of degradation of the Great Lakes. They are a unique natural \nresource for Ohio, the entire region, and the country--a resource that \nmust be protected for future generations. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in support of this bill and in our efforts to help preserve and \nprotect the long-term viability of our Great Lakes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to submit a concurrent \nresolution to honor the fallen soldiers we have lost in Operation \nEnduring Freedom (OEF) and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). My \nresolution, which Congressman Rahm Emanuel is introducing in the House \nof Representatives, directs the Architect of the Capitol to display an \nexhibit to honor the memory of these brave men and women in the Rotunda \nof the Capitol building during the period beginning on May 29, 2006, \nand ending on July 4, 2006. The exhibit will display the name, \nphotograph, and biographical information of each individual member of \nthe United States Armed Forces who has been killed in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Visitors will also have the opportunity to write messages of \nsupport and sympathy to the families of the fallen.\n  On March 20, 2006, we observed the third anniversary of the war of \nIraq. Since the start of the war, more than 2,500 American soldiers \nhave been killed serving their country. As we continue our efforts in \nIraq and Afghanistan, we must recognize the ultimate sacrifice made by \nthese troops. This temporary display will show the families of these \nheroes that they will always be remembered by a grateful nation.\n  I want to thank Senators Clinton, Bingaman, Kennedy, Johnson, Boxer, \nMenendez, Landrieu, Kerry, and Feinstein for co-sponsoring this \nimportant resolution. I hope that the rest of the Senate will support \nits passage, too.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, \nSenator Levin an Senator DeWine, in offering the Great Lakes \nCollaboration Implementation Act of 2006. I am a cosponsor of this \nbipartisan bill, introduced on behalf of the Great Lakes Senators by \nthe co-chairs of our Great Lakes Task Force. Our bill is also \ncosponsored by Senator Clinton, Senator Voinovich, and Senator Schumer.\n  The health and sustainability of the Great Lakes are something I feel \npassionately about. There is no more important issue to Michigan and \nour region of the country than the Great Lakes.\n  I want to take just a moment to recognize someone else who is equally \npassionate about Great Lakes protection and restoration. No single \nperson has devoted more time, energy, and personal resources to the \nGreat Lakes than Peter Wege of Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n  Peter Wege has been a leader and visionary for Great Lakes \nrestoration for decades. Through the Wege Foundation, which he founded \nin 1967, he has made generous gifts to the people of Grand Rapids and \ncommunities all over Western Michigan for community development. I \nbelieve that part of the reason we are standing here today with a \ncomprehensive bill to restore the Lakes is due to the work of Peter \nWege. In 2005, a gift from the Wege Foundation created the Healing Our \nWaters Coalition, a coalition of grassroots groups dedicated to \nsecuring a sustainable restoration plan and Federal and State funding \nto carry it out. The Healing Our Waters Coalition and Peter Wege have \nbeen instrumental in bringing Great Lakes restoration to the forefront \nof national policy.\n  For the people of Michigan the Great Lakes are more than just one-\nfifth of the world's fresh water and a unique ecosystem--they are part \nof our identity. The Lakes are where we spend summers with our \nfamilies, where we boat and swim, and where we fish and hunt. The Lakes \nalso sustain our State and local economies by providing a\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\nmajor route for intrastate and international commerce. The health and \nfuture of Michigan is directly linked to the health and future of the \nGreat Lakes.\n  We in Michigan are blessed with a beautiful State full of lakes, \nrivers, forests, and streams. We have more public access to waterways \nthan all of the other 49 States combined. We are surrounded by four of \nthe five Great Lakes and more than 40,000 interior lakes, streams, and \ntrails. This rich abundance of natural resources has made the outdoors \na critical part of Michigan's economy and our way-of-life. The Great \nLakes are key in this. Consider that the total revenue from Michigan's \nfishing, hunting and wildlife watching is nearly $5 billion every year. \nFishing brings $2 billion annually to our State economy. Michigan has \nthe most registered boaters of any State, nearly one million, and \nrecreational boating brings $2 billion annually to the state. It's easy \nto see what restoring the Great Lakes is so important to us.\n  There are currently between 140 and 200 separate Great Lakes \nenvironmental programs administered by 10 Federal agencies. Each of \nthese is important and has helped us significantly improve the health \nof the Great Lakes over the past 35 years. That said true restoration \nwill take local, regional, and national coordination on projects that \naddress all of the critical challenges facing the health of the Great \nLakes.\n  In May 2004, President Bush signed a Presidential Executive Order \ncreating the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration, also called the GLRC. \nThe group is composed of Federal agencies, Great Lakes governors and \nmayors, local communities, Native American Tribes, and other \nstakeholders from the Great Lakes Basin. In December of last year the \nGLRC released a report outlining comprehensive and collaborative \nrestoration of the Great Lakes ecosystem--the Great Lakes Regional \nCollaboration Strategy. The report calls for $20 billion in Federal, \nState, and local funding to clean up toxic hot-spots, restore wetlands, \nprevent the introduction of new invasive species, and modernizing water \ntreatment systems.\n  The GLRC Strategy has been endorsed through the Great Lakes Regional \nCollaboration Resolution by Great Lakes mayors, governors, tribes, the \nCongressional delegation, and the Interagency Task Force.\n  The bill that I am introducing today with my colleagues takes the \nnext critical step and turns the strategy document into an on-the-\nground reality.\n  Our commitment is strong. We have the will and the way, all we need \nnow is the support of Congress to ensure the future of the Great \nLakes--a magnificent natural resource that has been entrusted to our \ncare.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Great Lakes \nRestoration Implementation Act'' with Senator Mike DeWine and our co-\nsponsors, Senators Debbie Stabenow, George Voinovich, and Hillary \nRodham Clinton. I also want to thank Representatives Vern Ehlers and \nRahm Emanuel for introducing similar Great Lakes restoration \nlegislation in the House today.\n  The Great Lakes are vital not only to Michigan but to the Nation. \nRoughly one-tenth of the U.S. population lives in the Great Lakes basin \nand depends daily on the lakes. The Great Lakes provide drinking water \nto 33 million people. They provide the largest recreational resource \nfor their neighboring States. They form the largest body of freshwater \nin the world, containing roughly 18 percent of the world's total; only \nthe polar ice caps contain more freshwater. They are critical for our \neconomy by helping move natural resources to the factory and to move \nproducts to market.\n  While the environmental protections that were put in place in the \nearly 1970s have helped the Great Lakes make strides toward recovery, a \n2003 GAO report made clear that there is much work still to do. That \nreport stated: ``Despite early success in improving conditions in the \nGreat Lakes Basin, significant environmental challenges remain, \nincluding increased threats from invasive species and cleanup of areas \ncontaminated with toxic substances that pose human health threats.''\n  The Great Lakes problems have been well-known for several years, and, \nfor the past year, 1,500 people through the Great Lakes region have \nworked together to compile recommendations for restoring the lakes. \nThese recommendations were released last December, and, today, I am \nintroducing this legislation to implement those recommendations.\n  This bill would reduce the threat of new invasive species by enacting \ncomprehensive invasive species legislation and put ballast technology \non board ships; it specifically targets Asian carp by authorizing the \noperation and maintenance of the dispersal barrier. The bill would \nrestore fish and wildlife habitat by reauthorizing the Great Lakes Fish \nand Wildlife Restoration Act. It would provide additional resources to \nStates and cities for their water infrastructure. It would provide \nadditional funding for contaminated sediment cleanup and would give the \nEPA additional tools under the Great Lakes Legacy Act to move projects \nalong faster. The bill would create a new grant program to phase-out \nmercury in products. It would authorize additional research through \nexisting Federal programs as well as our non-Federal research \ninstitutions. And it would authorize coordination of federal programs.\n  The Great Lakes are a unique American treasure. We must recognize \nthat we are only their temporary stewards. If Congress does not act to \nkeep pace with the needs of the lakes, and the tens of millions of \nAmericans dependent upon them and affected by their condition, the \ncurrent problems will continue to build, and we may start to undo some \nof the good work that has already been done. We must be good stewards \nby ensuring that the federal government meets its ongoing obligation to \nprotect and restore the Great Lakes. This legislation will help us meet \nthat great responsibility to future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 2550. A bill to provide for direct access to electronic tax return \nfiling, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. As the tax filing deadline approaches, I am \ndelighted to introduce the Free Internet Filing Act. The bill requires \nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to provide universal access to \nindividual taxpayers filing their tax returns directly through the IRS \nWeb site. I thank Senator Bingaman for cosponsoring this bill and \nworking with me on so many issues that are important to taxpayers.\n  It is frustrating that individual taxpayers completing their own \nreturns are not able to file directly with the IRS. Taxpayers are \ndependent on commercial preparers to electronically file their taxes. \nIf a taxpayer takes the time necessary to prepare their returns by \nthemselves, they must be provided with the option of electronically \nfiling directly with the IRS. My legislation would make this direct \nfiling possible.\n  The current system that provides a select group of taxpayers with the \nability to file electronically for free using third party \nintermediaries, called the Free File Alliance, is a failure. In \ntestimony before the Finance Committee yesterday, The National Taxpayer \nAdvocate, Ms. Nina Olson, testified that ``As currently structured, \nFree File amounts to a Wild, Wild West of differing eligibility \nrequirements, differing capabilities, differing availability of and \nfees for add-on products, and many sites that are difficult to use.'' \nMs. Olson also stated that the ``IRS should place a basic, fill-in \ntemplate on its website to allow any taxpayer who wants to self-prepare \nhis or her return to do so and file directly with the IRS for free.'' I \ncompletely agree.\n  The current Free File Alliance agreement leaves out too many \ntaxpayers. Taxpayers that make more than $50,000 are not eligible. In \naddition, tax preparation companies try to sell additional products and \nservices, such as refund anticipation loans, to consumers that utilize \ntheir free file services that are accessed via the IRS Web site. \nTaxpayers should not be forced to access online filing through \ncompanies that peddle services and products to them. Taxpayers are \ndirected to these companies via the IRS Web site. This should not \nhappen. While paying their taxes\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nand fulfilling their obligations, taxpayers should be allowed to file \ndirectly without being subjected to sales pitches or ads. Taxpayers \nshould not have the additional worry associated with sharing their \nprivate financial information with a tax preparation company. In the \ncurrent environment where there have been so many electronic breeches \nof financial information, taxpayers should not be forced to hand over \ntheir private information if they want to electronically file their \nreturn with the IRS. Taxpayers should not lose out on the benefits of \nelectronic filing simply because they are worried about sending their \ndata to third parties.\n  My legislation will help increase the number of electronically filed \nreturns. As Ms. Olson pointed out, nearly 45 million returns prepared \nusing software are mailed in rather than electronically filed. With \nuniversal access to free e-file, this number could be substantially \nreduced. Electronic returns help taxpayers receive their refunds faster \nthan mailing them in. This would also save the IRS resources and reduce \npossible errors that can occur when the mailed in returns are \ntranscribed.\n  I want to take a moment to express my appreciation for all of the \ntremendous work that Ms. Olson has done in an attempt to improve the \nlives of taxpayers. It is a pleasure to work with Ms. Olson and her \nstaff both in Washington and Hawaii. I look forward to continuing to \nwork with the National Taxpayer Advocate, other Treasury officials, and \nmy colleagues to expand access to Internet filing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter of support from \nthe Hawaii Alliance for Community-Based Economic Development be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2550\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DIRECT ACCESS TO E-FILE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     provide individual taxpayers with the ability to \n     electronically file their Federal income tax returns through \n     the Internal Revenue Service website without the use of an \n     intermediary or with the use of an intermediary which is \n     contracted by the Internal Revenue Service to provide free \n     universal access for such filing (hereafter in this section \n     referred to as the ``direct e-file program'') for taxable \n     years beginning after the date which is not later than 3 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Development and Operation of Program.--In providing for \n     the development and operation of the direct e-file program, \n     the Secretary of the Treasury shall--\n       (1) consult with nonprofit organizations representing the \n     interests of taxpayers as well as other private and nonprofit \n     organizations and Federal, State, and local agencies as \n     determined appropriate by the Secretary,\n       (2) promulgate such regulations as necessary to administer \n     such program, and\n       (3) conduct a public information and consumer education \n     campaign to encourage taxpayers to use the direct e-file \n     program.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     the direct e-file program. Any sums so appropriated shall \n     remain available until expended.\n       (d) Reports to Congress.--\n       (1) Report on implementation.--The Secretary of the \n     Treasury shall report to the Committee on Finance of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives every 6 months regarding the status of the \n     implementation of the direct e-file program.\n       (2) Report on usage.--The Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the National Taxpayer Advocate, shall \n     report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives \n     annually on taxpayer usage of the direct e-file program.\n                                  ____\n\n         Hawai`i Alliance for Community-Based Economic \n           Development,\n                                      Honolulu, HI, April 4, 2006.\n     Hon. Daniel K. Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, 141 Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: The Hawai`i Alliance for Community \n     Based Economic Development (HACBED) is writing in support of \n     the ``Free Internet Filing Act.''\n       HACBED is a statewide 501(c)3 organization established in \n     1992 to help maximize the impact of community-based economic \n     development organizations (CBEDOs). We pursue our mission by \n     helping CBEDOs to increase community control of their assets \n     and means of production. We accomplish this in many ways--by \n     providing technical support to help CBEDOs deal with \n     organizational issues; by networking on a local and national \n     basis for funding and financing for community-based efforts; \n     and, by advocating for communities to play a more active role \n     in the political process in order to effect systemic change. \n     To this end, HACBED has been facilitating statewide \n     conversations to develop a comprehensive asset policy agenda. \n     Core to this agenda is the recognition of the importance of \n     creating policies that assist individuals, families and the \n     broader community to build wealth.\n       Tax season is an essential time for low income families to \n     take advantage of their tax related benefits, including the \n     earned income tax credit. Electronic filing of taxes is a \n     quicker, more efficient way to process a tax return. In many \n     cases, working families must pay a professional tax preparer \n     to prepare their return and file electronically. By providing \n     free universal access to electronic filing these low income \n     working families would be able to keep more of their hard \n     earned dollars in their pocket.\n       HACBED fully supports this bill and we look forward to \n     working with you in the future to insure free and low cost \n     tax related services for low income families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Brent Dillabaugh,\n     Public Policy Director.\n                                  ____\n\n      By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 2551. A bill to provide for prompt payment and interest on late \npayments of health care claims; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, to preserve seniors' and \nall patients' access to local pharmacies, doctors and hospitals. Since \nthese providers are on the front lines of our communities' health care \nsystems and often find themselves squeezed by insurance copies on the \none hand and their obligation to take care of patients on the other, \nthis bill aims to relieve their burden by requiring prescription drug \nmanagers, managed care plans and other private health insurers to pay \nhealth care claims in a timely fashion.\n  The Prompt Payment of Health Benefits Claims Act bill seeks to \naddress the financial strains being faced by hospitals and physicians \nin my State of New Jersey and across the country. In addition, this \nlegislation would address the new financial crisis pharmacies are \nfacing in light of the new Medicare Prescription Drug benefit. \nSpecifically, the legislation requires prescription drug managers, \nprivate health plans and other private health insurers to pay manually \nfiled claims within 30 days and electronically filed claims within 14 \ndays. Insurers that fail to meet these timeframes would be required to \npay interest for every day the claims goes unpaid. Insurers that \nknowingly violate these prompt payment requirements would be subject to \nmonetary penalties.\n  A Federal prompt pay law is critical to ensuring that our pharmacies \nand health care providers maintain adequate cash flows and are able to \ncontinue functioning. Seniors and all patients depend on their local \npharmacists and preferred physicians. They are the providers that know \ntheir patients best and ensure that they receive the important care \nthey need and deserve. The threat of local pharmacies, physicians and \nhospitals going out of business has serious consequences with regards \nto the kind of care the community will receive.\n  The need for this legislation cannot be understated. In my State of \nNew Jersey, local pharmacies have never had a more challenging \nfinancial situation. They are encountering lower reimbursement rates \nfrom the prescription drug managers and a 60-90 day lag time in \nreimbursements, which are putting many on the brink of going out of \nbusiness. Almost half of all hospitals are operating in the red, and \nthat number is growing. Physicians and hospitals are experiencing \nrising health care operating costs and tight Federal and State budgets. \nUntimely payment of claims has only compounded these problems.\n  The problem of late payments has reached such a crisis that the \nmajority of States, including New Jersey, have enacted ``prompt pay'' \nlaws to require insurers to pay their bills within a specific \ntimeframe. Unfortunately, New Jersey's law, like most similar State \nlaws, is largely ineffective because it\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\nlacks strong enforcement provisions and offers no incentives for \nprivate insurers to comply. Furthermore, State prompt-pay laws apply \nonly to State-regulated plans, which only cover approximately half of \nNew Jerseyans that are insured.\n  The bottom line is that pharmacies, physicians, hospitals and other \nhealth care providers should not have to shoulder the burden of unpaid \nclaims. These local providers have fulfilled their commitment to care \nfor patients, and my legislation will ensure that private insurers \nassume the financial responsibilities for the health coverage they are \nbeing paid to provide.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record as follows:\n\n                                S. 2551\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Omnibus Control and Safe Streets Act of \n1968 to clarify that Indian tribes are eligible to receive grants for \nconfronting the use of methamphetamine, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senators Dorgan and \nCantwell in introducing a bill to amend the recently passed PATRIOT Act \nreauthorization to ensure that Indian tribes are eligible for Federal \nmethamphetamine-related grants. The legislation would allow tribes, \nlike States, to receive grants to reduce the availability of meth in \nhot spot areas; grants for programs for drug-endangered children; and \ngrants to address methamphetamine use by pregnant and parenting women \noffenders.\n  The scourge of methamphetamine has afflicted much of our Nation, and \nit has had particularly devastating effects on Indian reservations. The \nproblem of meth in Indian country, which the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians identified this year as its top priority, is \nubiquitous, and has strained already overburdened law enforcement, \nhealth, social welfare, housing, and child protective and placement \nservices on Indian reservations. Last week a former tribal judge on the \nWind River Reservation in Wyoming pled guilty to conspiracy to \ndistribute methamphetamine and other drugs. The day before, the Navajo \nNation police arrested an 81 year old grandmother, her daughter, and \nher granddaughter, for selling meth. One tribe in Arizona had over 60 \nbabies born last year with meth in their systems. At a hearing in the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee last month on child abuse, witnesses \ntestified that methamphetamine is a significant cause of abuse and \nneglect of Indian children. Last year, the National Indian Housing \nCouncil expanded its training for dealing with meth in tribal housing: \nthe average cost of decontaminating a single residence that has been \nused a meth lab is $10,000. Meth is affecting every aspect of tribal \nlife and something must be done.\n  The measure I am introducing today takes but a small step on the long \njourney toward ridding Indian country of the blight of methamphetamine. \nI encourage my colleagues to support it. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2552\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to designate the U.S. Post Office at 2633 11th Street in \nRock Island, Illinois, as the ``Lane Evans Post Office Building.''\n  This legislation honors my friend and fellow Illinoisan Lane Evans \nwho has decided to retire instead of seeking re-election to the House \nof Representatives in November. Congressman Lane Evans, born and raised \nin Rock Island, represents Illinois' 17th Congressional District. He \nwas first elected in 1982 and is serving his eleventh term in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. From the Quad Cities to Quincy, from \nSpringfield to Decatur and Carlinville, in cities and towns throughout \nhis district, Lane Evans is deeply respected. His service will be \ngreatly missed.\n  Congressman Evans was a Vietnam-era veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps \nand rose to the position of Ranking Democratic Member of the House \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. He is recognized as a leading advocate of \nveterans in Congress. He successfully led legislative efforts to pass \nAgent Orange compensation and health and compensation benefits for \nchildren of veterans exposed to Agent Orange who were born with spina \nbifida, a crippling birth defect. Congressman Evans also led the effort \nto secure benefits for Persian Gulf veterans and to provide full \ndisclosure about their possible exposure to toxins during their \nservice. He has also worked to expand services to women veterans, \npushed for increased help for veterans suffering from post-traumatic \nstress disorder, and established important new programs to assist in \nthe rehabilitation and health care treatment of thousands of homeless \nveterans.\n  Congressman Evans is also a member of the House Armed Services \nCommittee and is Chairman of the Vietnam Veterans in Congress Caucus. \nHe is also Co-Chairman of the Alcohol Fuels Caucus, the Congressional \nWorking Group on Parkinson's Disease, and the International Workers \nRights Caucus. Congressman Evans has been named an ``Environmental \nHero'' for his pro-environment voting record by the League of \nConservation Voters and awarded the Conservationist of the Year Award \nfor 1995 by the Heart of Illinois Sierra Club, the first time the \norganization gave the honor to a non-volunteer.\n  Congressman Evans was born in Rock Island on August 4, 1951. He \nattended grade school and high school in Rock Island. Following \ngraduation from high school, he joined the Marine Corps and was \nstationed in Okinawa. He received an honorable discharge in 1971. \nCongressman Evans received a B.A. (magna cum laude) in 1974 from \nAugustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. He also attended Black Hawk \nCollege in Moline, Illinois. He is a 1978 graduate of Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center in Washington, D.C. Following his graduation from \nlaw school, he practiced law in Rock Island where he served children, \nthe poor and working families.\n  For over 20 years, Lane Evans has been my closest friend in the \nIllinois Congressional Delegation. We came to the House of \nRepresentatives together and he proved to be an indomitable force. Time \nand again, Lane Evans has shown extraordinary political courage \nfighting for the values that brought him to public service. But his \ngreatest show of courage has been over the last 10 years as he battled \nParkinson's disease and those who tried to exploit his physical \nweakness. His determination to serve the 17th Congressional District he \nloves pushed him to work harder as Parkinson's became a heavier burden \neach day. His dignity and perseverance in the face of this relentless \nand cruel disease is an inspiration to everyone who knows Lane Evans.\n  I am pleased to offer this legislation to permanently and publicly \nrecognize Lane Evans and his service to his Congressional District, our \nState of Illinois, and the entire United States by naming the Rock \nIsland Post Office in his honor. It would be a most appropriate way for \nus to express our appreciation to Congressman Evans and to commemorate \nhis public life and work.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2555\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today is the 20th anniversary of the \nmurder of a 19-year-old on a Pennsylvania college campus, Lehigh \nUniversity in Bethlehem, PA. Twenty years ago, a student who was on \ndrugs and alcohol entered her room through three doors which should \nhave been locked and committed a brutal rape and murder.\n  When I was district attorney of Philadelphia, I dealt with numerous \nincidents of campus crime and knew firsthand of the severity. However, \nI believe that many people would be surprised by the extent of the \nproblem.\n  According to U.S. Department of Education statistics, from 2001 to \n2003, there were a total of 84 homicides, 7,941 sex offenses, 9,296 \naggravated assaults, and 3,367 arsons on college campuses during that \nperiod of time.\n  The parents of Jeanne Clery, Connie and Howard Clery, have undertaken \na crusade to try to prevent the recurrence of the brutal crime against \ntheir daughter and have had a national campaign. Part of that was their \nefforts, which I joined them on, to introduce the Crime Awareness and \nCampus Security Act of 1989, which became law in 1990.\n  Regrettably, there is only about one-third compliance with the \nschools on that act. The beginning of the school year is the time they \ncall the Red Zone, when there are more offenses likely to be committed. \nFor this reason, Security on Campus has designated September 2006 as \nNational Campus Safety Awareness Month to provide an opportunity for \ncolleges and universities to inform students about existing campus \ncrime trends. At a very minimum, the colleges and universities ought to \ncomply with the law on disclosure so that students may know what the \nrisks are.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my prepared statement \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter\n\n\n           National Campus Safety Awareness Month Resolution\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today \n     to introduce a resolution supporting the goals and ideals of \n     National Campus Safety Awareness Month. Today is a somber \n     yet, important day for this resolution to be introduced as it \n     marks the 20th Anniversary of Jeanne Clery's murder. In the \n     early morning hours of April 5, 1986, Jeanne Clery, a 19 year \n     old student at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, \n     was brutally raped and murdered in her dormitory room. Her \n     killer was a drug and alcohol abuser and a Lehigh University \n     student whom Jeanne had never met. He gained access to her \n     room by proceeding, unopposed, through three propped-open \n     doors, each of which should have been locked. This heinous \n     crime opened the eyes of our nation to the extent of crime on \n     college and university campuses.\n       When I was district attorney of Philadelphia, I dealt with \n     numerous incidents of campus crime and know firsthand of its \n     severity. However, I believe that many would be surprised by \n     the extent of the problem. According to recent U.S. \n     Department of Education statistics, a total of 84 homicides; \n     7,941 sex offenses; 9,296 aggravated assaults; and 3,367 \n     arsons were reported on our nation's college and university \n     campuses from 2001 to 2003. In addition, 1,700 college \n     students between the ages of 18 and 24 die each year from \n     alcohol related unintentional injuries, including motor \n     vehicle crashes. Additionally, more than 696,000 students are \n     assaulted by another student who has been drinking and more \n     than 97,000 students are victims of alcohol related sexual \n     assault or date rape according to the latest research from \n     the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.\n       Since their daughter's death, Connie and Howard Clery, have \n     worked tirelessly in their daughter's memory to protect the \n     lives of college students by warning them of these dangers \n     through the work of Security On Campus, Inc., a national \n     nonprofit that they founded, which is based in King of \n     Prussia, Pennsylvania. The Clerys first brought these issues \n     to my attention shortly after their daughter's murder and I \n     worked with them\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n     to develop the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of \n     1989, which became law in 1990. This Act was modified and \n     included in the Higher Education Act of 1998, as the Jeanne \n     Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime \n     Statistics Act. Although the U.S. Department of Justice has \n     concluded that only a third of all schools are reporting \n     their campus crime statistics in a manner fully compliant \n     with the law, the Clery Act has significantly changed the \n     landscape of campus security for the better, but as the \n     statistics reveal, more work remains to be done.\n       Security on Campus has found that the beginning of each new \n     school year can be an especially dangerous time for students. \n     This is particularly true for first year students who are on \n     their own for the first time in a new environment and are \n     experiencing new freedoms. Due to the increased risk of \n     sexual assault that female college students face during this \n     time, the period from the start of the Fall semester through \n     the end of November is often referred to as the ``Red Zone''. \n     For this reason, Security on Campus has designated September \n     2006 as National Campus Safety Awareness Month to provide \n     opportunity for colleges and universities to inform students \n     about existing campus crime trends, campus security policies, \n     crime prevention techniques, fire safety, and alcohol and \n     other drug education, prevention and treatment programs.\n       Throughout the past several years, I have worked together \n     with the Clerys, Security on Campus, and crime prevention \n     professionals on campuses across the country to help raise \n     much needed awareness about these dangers. Thus, I urge my \n     colleagues, in honor of Jeanne Clery's memory, to join me in \n     this effort by supporting the goals and ideals of National \n     Campus Safety Awareness Month.\n       Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2917-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 427--COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                           INTERSTATE SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bond, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \nChafee, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Thune, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Isakson, \nMr. Jeffords, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Carper, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Obama, and Mr. Reid) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Con. Res. 87\n\n       Whereas the United States is the world's largest creator, \n     producer, and exporter of copyrighted materials;\n       Whereas this important sector of the United States economy \n     continues to be at great risk due to the widespread \n     unauthorized reproduction, distribution, and sale of \n     copyrighted United States works, including motion pictures, \n     home video and television programming, music and sound \n     recordings, books, video games, and software;\n       Whereas estimates point to a rate of intellectual property \n     piracy of between 70 to 90 percent in some countries, with \n     annual losses to the United States economy in the billions of \n     dollars;\n       Whereas the major copyright industries are responsible for \n     an estimated 6 percent of the Nation's total gross domestic \n     product and an annual employment rate of more than 3 percent;\n       Whereas strong overseas sales and exports by the major \n     copyright industries are even more important as the United \n     States trade deficit continues to increase, and as the United \n     States economy grows more reliant on the generation of \n     intellectual property and in services related thereto;\n       Whereas the Congress is greatly concerned about the failure \n     of some of the trading partners of the United States to meet \n     their international obligations with respect to intellectual \n     property protection;\n       Whereas in the Russian Federation, perpetrators of piracy, \n     including one of the largest commercial Internet pirates in \n     the world, are permitted to operate without meaningful \n     hindrance from the Russian Government, and a number of \n     factories located on government property produce pirated \n     products;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation is now considering the \n     adoption of a civil code that would annul the country's \n     existing intellectual property law, and incorporate \n     principles that do not conform to its international \n     obligations;\n       Whereas the Senate and the House of Representatives have \n     both overwhelmingly passed legislation expressing the sense \n     of the Congress that the Russian Federation must \n     significantly improve the protection of intellectual property \n     as part of its effort to accede to the World Trade \n     Organization and to maintain eligibility in the generalized \n     system of preferences (GSP) program;\n       Whereas markets in the People's Republic of China are \n     replete with pirated versions of United States movies, sound \n     recordings, business software, and video games, resulting in \n     over $2,000,000,000 in losses each year to the United States \n     economy;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China has made a number of \n     commitments to the United States which it has yet to meet, \n     including pledges to significantly reduce piracy rates, \n     increase criminal prosecutions of intellectual property \n     rights infringements, reduce exports of infringing goods, \n     improve national police coordination, and join global \n     Internet treaties;\n       Whereas the People's Republic of China and the Russian \n     Federation export thousands of pirated versions of products \n     of the United States to other countries;\n       Whereas Mexico has a strong market for pirated goods, with \n     thousands of street vendors offering pirated products \n     throughout the country;\n       Whereas Canada has become a source of camcorder piracy, has \n     failed to bring its copyright law into conformity with \n     international standards, and has failed to adequately prevent \n     pirated products from other parts of the world from entering \n     the country;\n       Whereas India can further improve copyright protections, \n     particularly with regard to enforcement, deterrent \n     sentencing, and coordination of national efforts;\n       Whereas Malaysia continues to be a leading source of \n     pirated entertainment software and other copyrighted \n     materials produced for export; and\n       Whereas steps must be taken to ensure that the rights of \n     creators and distributors are protected abroad and that \n     creative industries in the United States continue to \n     flourish: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\n       (1) the United States should not complete any agreement \n     relating to the accession of the Russian Federation to the \n     World Trade Organization until the Russian Federation takes \n     concrete steps to address widespread intellectual property \n     violations, including--\n       (A) the closure and seizure of factories and machinery used \n     for piracy;\n       (B) imposition of meaningful penal sanctions;\n       (C) investigation and prosecution of organized criminal \n     piracy syndicates; and\n       (D) rejection of proposals that would undermine its \n     existing intellectual property rights regime and retreat \n     further from global standards;\n       (2) the People's Republic of China should fundamentally \n     change its intellectual property rights enforcement model by \n     significantly increasing the application of criminal \n     sanctions against major copyright pirates and imposing \n     effective deterrent penalties;\n       (3) Mexico, Canada, India, and Malaysia should work in \n     cooperation with the United States Government and industries \n     in the United States to address growing piracy problems \n     within their borders;\n       (4) the failure of the countries listed in paragraph (3) to \n     act and protect against the theft of United States \n     intellectual property will have political and economic \n     consequences with regard to relations between these countries \n     and the United States; and\n       (5) the President should use all effective remedies and \n     solutions to protect the intellectual property rights of \n     United States persons and entities, and maintain policies \n     that vigorously respond to the failure by other countries to \n     abide by international standards of protection or to \n     otherwise provide adequate and effective protection of \n     intellectual property as provided under United States law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/04/05/senate-section/article/S2920-1", "month": "04", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2920-S2922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3312.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REIMBURSING STATES \n                   FOR THE COSTS OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government to \n     adequately secure the borders of the United States and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented immigrants into the United \n     States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that, according to the Congressional \n     Research Service, Border Patrol agents apprehend more than \n     1,000,000 individuals each year trying to illegally enter the \n     United States, the net growth in the number of unauthorized \n     immigrants entering the United States has increased by \n     approximately 500,000 each year.\n       (3) The costs associated with incarcerating undocumented \n     criminal immigrants and providing education and healthcare to \n     undocumented immigrants place a tremendous financial burden \n     on States and local governments.\n       (4) In 2003, States received compensation from the Federal \n     Government, through the State criminal alien assistance \n     program under section 241(i) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(i)), for incarcerating \n     approximately 74,000 undocumented criminal immigrants.\n       (5) In 2003, 700 local governments received compensation \n     from the Federal Government, through the State criminal alien \n     assistance program, for incarcerating approximately 138,000 \n     undocumented criminal immigrants.\n       (6) It is estimated that Federal Government payments \n     through the State criminal alien assistance program reimburse \n     States and local governments for 25 percent or less of the \n     actual costs of incarcerating the undocumented criminal \n     immigrants.\n       (7) It is estimated that providing kindergarten through \n     grade 12 education to undocumented immigrants costs States \n     more than $8,000,000,000 annually.\n       (8) It is further estimated that more than $1,000,000,000 \n     is spent on healthcare for undocumented immigrants each year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) States should be fully reimbursed by the Federal \n     Government for the costs associated with providing education \n     and healthcare to undocumented immigrants; and\n       (2) the program authorized under section 241(i) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1231(i)) should be \n     fully funded, for each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2012, \n     at the levels authorized for such program under section \n     241(i)(5) of such Act (as amended by section 218(b)(2) of \n     this Act).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 3366.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Border Law Enforcement \n     Relief Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 152. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the obligation of the Federal Government of the \n     United States to adequately secure the Nation's borders and \n     prevent the flow of undocumented persons and illegal drugs \n     into the United States.\n       (2) Despite the fact that the United States Border Patrol \n     apprehends over 1,000,000 people each year trying to \n     illegally enter the United States, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, the net growth in the number \n     of unauthorized aliens has increased by approximately 500,000 \n     each year. The Southwest border accounts for approximately 94 \n     percent of all migrant apprehensions each year. Currently, \n     there are an estimated 11,000,000 unauthorized aliens in the \n     United States.\n       (3) The border region is also a major corridor for the \n     shipment of drugs. According to the El Paso Intelligence \n     Center, 65 percent of the narcotics that are sold in the \n     markets of the United States enter the country through the \n     Southwest Border.\n       (4) Border communities continue to incur significant costs \n     due to the lack of adequate border security. A 2001 study by \n     the United States-Mexico Border Counties Coalition found that \n     law enforcement and criminal justice expenses associated with \n     illegal immigration exceed $89,000,000 annually for the \n     Southwest border counties.\n       (5) In August 2005, the States of New Mexico and Arizona \n     declared states of emergency in order to provide local law \n     enforcement immediate assistance in addressing criminal \n     activity along the Southwest border.\n       (6) While the Federal Government provides States and \n     localities assistance in covering costs related to the \n     detention of certain criminal aliens and the prosecution of \n     Federal drug cases, local law enforcement along the border \n     are provided no assistance in covering such expenses and must \n     use their limited resources to combat drug trafficking, human \n     smuggling, kidnappings, the destruction of private property, \n     and other border-related crimes.\n       (7) The United States shares 5,525 miles of border with \n     Canada and 1,989 miles with Mexico. Many of the local law \n     enforcement agencies located along the border are small, \n     rural departments charged with patrolling large areas of \n     land. Counties along the Southwest United States-Mexico \n     border are some of the poorest in the country and lack the \n     financial resources to cover the additional costs associated \n     with illegal immigration, drug trafficking, and other border-\n     related crimes.\n       (8) Federal assistance is required to help local law \n     enforcement operating along the border address the unique \n     challenges that arise as a result of their proximity to an \n     international border and the lack of overall border security \n     in the region\n\n     SEC. 153.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Sarbanes and \nmyself, I call up a resolution which is at the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 425) to commend the University of \n     Maryland women's basketball\n\n[[Page S3157]]\n\n     team for winning the 2006 National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association Division I National Basketball Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I offer this resolution on behalf of \nSenator Sarbanes and myself.\n  Yes, the women's basketball team of the University of Maryland did \nwin the women's basketball championship. I am here today to offer this \nresolution and to state I am so proud of the young women of this \nchampionship basketball team.\n  Led by Coach B, Brenda Frese, the Terps finished the season with a \nrecord of 34 wins and 4 losses, a fine record for any basketball team. \nIt was especially sweet because those Terps defied all expert \npredictions.\n  Last night was a game for the history books. It went into overtime \nand, at the same time, was in overdrive.\n  I have to say a word about our worthy opponent, the Blue Devils. They \nwere champions, too. What we saw on the court was fierce play, \nbrilliant strategy, and the American value of sportsmanship.\n  But there is only one winner of each game, and although Duke played \nvery well, our Maryland Lady Terps were, indeed, a story champion. The \nUniversity of Maryland has a fine basketball tradition. The national \nchampionship team exemplifies all that is good about it. They are \nstudent athletes. They study 2 hours a day to make sure they are going \nto graduate and have fulfilled the American dream while they are out \nthere playing the hoop dream.\n  Last night proved to the country their maturity, their grace under \npressure, their skill, and their indomitable spirit.\n  The most outstanding player of the tournament, Laura Harper, held the \nTerps together, scoring in that first half when Duke was playing great \ndefense. But in the second half, after Coach B's terrific motivational \nspeech, they were out there and the colors shone through. Behind by 13 \npoints with only 15 minutes left, they would not give up to pressure. \nCoach B called her team to the bench for a breather, and they returned \nto the court as if there were no deficit to overcome. The energy and \nthe poise of the tri-captains--Shay Doron, scooting down that court, \ndashing through the defense of the Blue Devils, zinging in for her \npoints and, at the same time, making most of her free throws; Crystal \nLanghorne, though boxed in, did a dramatic steal and surged ahead; and \nthere was Charmaine Carr, backing up the team.\n  This pushed the team over the hump. As the clock wound down, the \nTerps had closed the gap and finally we were into overtime. Then a \nfreshman guard, Kristi Toliver, came down the floor. They had her boxed \nin, yet from a dramatic distance she made a magical three-pointer with \nonly 6 seconds left. And as the Terps fans know, it was fear the \nturtle. It showed that overtime is our time.\n  Freshman Marissa Coleman played superb basketball. We all know the \noutcome.\n  When the final buzzer sounded, the University of Maryland Terrapins \nwere crowned the national champion.\n  I congratulate the players and the coach for the excitement of such a \nwonderful game and a wonderful season, and I congratulate them on their \nsportsmanship.\n  Elizabeth Dole and I had a bet on the outcome. By the way, you should \nknow that in order to be in the final four you have to have a woman \nSenator here. There was LSU, Senator Landrieu; Senator Dole had to have \ntwo teams, and there she was; and, of course, Senator Barb Mikulski \nwith her Terrapins. Senator Dole and I had a friendly bet, my crab \ncakes against her barbecue. We shared some barbecue together and some \nof their sweet tea, which is as nice as our friendship.\n  That is what sportsmanship is. Hats off to the Terps, and hats off to \ntitle IX that made it all possible.\n  I will not yield that championship next year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, it is with a profound sense of Maryland \npride and pleasure that I rise in joining my Maryland colleague, \nSenator Barbara Mikulski, in introducing a resolution congratulating \nthe University of Maryland Terrapins for winning the 2006 NCAA Women's \nNational Basketball Championship. Joining us in this effort is the \nMaryland House delegation, spearheaded by University of Maryland alum, \nCongressman Steny Hoyer.\n  As our resolution highlights, this has been a terrific run for the \nwomen's basketball team. The team notched 33 wins, the most for any \nDivision I men's or women's basketball team this season. Maryland was \nalso the only team in the Nation to score more than 3,000 points. With \nthis championship, the team became only the fourth school to secure \nchampionships in both men's and women's basketball, joining Stanford \nUniversity, the University of Connecticut and the University of North \nCarolina.\n  Maryland, after its stellar regular season, was surprisingly selected \nas a No. 2 seed. The young team, which started two freshmen, two \nsophomores and one junior, seemed to thrive on the NCAA selection \ncommittee's underestimation. They played in, and won, six overtime \ngames this season, including the positively thrilling come-from-behind-\nvictory in the championship game. Down by thirteen points with fifteen \nminutes left in regulation, the Terps kept chipping away at the lead, \ncapping it off with a terrific three point shot by freshman guard, \nKristi Toliver, to tie the game at 70 with 6.1 seconds left in \nregulation.\n  In overtime the Lady Terps showed why they consider the extra period \nto be ``their time.'' Smothering defense and poise in shooting free \nthrows secured the brilliant win down the final stretch.\n  The championship team consisted of senior guard/forward Charmaine \nCarr, freshman guard/forward Marissa Coleman, junior guard Shay Doron, \njunior guard Kalika France, sophomore forward/center Laura Harper, \nsophomore center/forward Crystal Langhorne, sophomore guard Christie \nMarrone, sophomore guard Ashleigh Newman, junior center Aurelie Noirez, \nsophomore forward/center Jade Perry, senior forward/center Angel Ross, \nfreshman guard Kristi Toliver, and sophomore guard Sa'de Wiley-\nGatewood. Their victory could not have been secured without the \ntalented coaches and staff led by head coach Brenda Frese, assisted by \ncoaches Jeff Walz, Erica Floyd, and Joanna Bernabei. Finally, I'd like \nto acknowledge the director of basketball operations, Mark Pearson and \nathletic director Debbie Yow.\n  On behalf of the State of Maryland, the Maryland congressional \ndelegation and the University of Maryland, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in acknowledging the outstanding efforts of this amazing group of \nbasketball players, coaches and staff.\n  Cheer the turtle!\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, \nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 425) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as Chairman and on behalf of my colleagues \non the Environment and Public Works Committee, I urge support of this \nresolution to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Interstate \nSystem. The Committee as a whole would like to mark the momentous \nachievements made over the last 50 years that have provided for \nrevolutionary advances in our nation's vital infrastructure. It is \nessential that Congress, just as it did in 1956, recognize the \nimportance of continued investment in our nation's highways and the \nundeniable link between a robust economy and a vibrant national \ninfrastructure.\n  Because of my work on SAFETEA-LU (Public Law 109-59) I have a better \nappreciation of just how visionary the authors of the Federal-Aid \nHighway Act of 1956 were when they laid out a network of interstate \nhighways and devised a stable and reliable funding stream to pay for \nit. I am certain that at the time there were those who felt the plan \nwas too ambitious, too expensive and consequently not a good use of \nscarce Federal dollars. I am sure all would agree that not only was it \na good use of scarce Federal dollars, but that the nation has enjoyed a \nmany-fold return on the expenditure.\n  Laying out the full interstate system--rather than a piecemeal of \nroad segments--along with providing a dedicated funding source \nexpedited construction and provided certainty. This certainty maximized \nthe economic and mobility benefits of the system. Businesses and \nindividuals knew that they could locate somewhere on the future \ninterstate system and be connected to rest of the country.\n  The second essential element of the success of the highway program \nover the last 50 years has been the dependable funding stream for the \ninterstate. In the absence of this dedicated funding source, it is my \nfirm belief that investment in our nation's highways and bridges would \nbe far less than has been the case. Without the relative certainty of \nfunding and knowledge of the interstate's general location, the impacts \non productivity and economic growth would have been dramatically less \nthan we experienced.\n  The connectivity and mobility provided for both freight and people by \nour interstate system is unrivaled: and I believe was more than just a \nsmall part of the economic success enjoyed by the U.S. over the past 50 \nyears. It is essential that we continue to make the necessary \ninvestment to fight congestion and maintain the mobility necessary to \nkeep the economy growing.\n  I have always said that the federal government has two main \nfunctions: national defense and to provide infrastructure. Since one of \nthe earliest justifications for the interstate system was to provide \nfor national defense, the highway program is actually a perfect merger \nof the 2 most important functions of government.\n  For the last 50 years the gas tax has been deposited into the trust \nfund and used to construct and maintain our roads. In the past, the gas \ntax has been a reasonably good proxy for road use; and the trust fund \nhas in recent history had sufficient receipts to fund the highway \nprogram. This is changing with the increase in fuel efficiency, \nhighlighted by fuel-cell vehicles coming just over the horizon, and \nimproved technology allows for improvements in how to collect the user \nfee. It is important to look forward to how we fund the highway program \nin the future because when the next highway bill is drafted, there will \nbe no cushion of a cash balance left in the trust fund.\n  The current challenges facing the highway trust fund--and hence the \nhighway program--will be very difficult to resolve and not unlike the \nchallenges faced by the authors of the 1956 act. It will be up to \npolicymakers to be as visionary as they were 50 years ago. A new vision \nis needed in what the highway program will stand for in the next 50 \nyears and how to pay for it.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 427) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 427\n\n       Whereas, on June 29, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower \n     signed into law--\n       (1) the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (Public Law 84-627; \n     70 Stat. 374) to establish the 41,000-mile National System of \n     Interstate and Defense Highways, later designated as the \n     ``Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and \n     Defense Highways''; and\n       (2) the Highway Revenue Act of 1956 (Public Law 84-627; 70 \n     Stat. 387) to create the Highway Trust Fund;\n       Whereas, in 1990, the National System of Interstate and \n     Defense Highways was renamed the Dwight D. Eisenhower System \n     of Interstate and Defense Highways to recognize the role of \n     President Eisenhower in the creation of the Interstate \n     Highway System;\n       Whereas that web of superhighways, now spanning a total of \n     46,876 miles throughout the United States, has had a powerful \n     and positive impact on the lives of United States citizens;\n       Whereas the Interstate System has proven to be a vital tool \n     for transporting people and goods from 1 region to another \n     speedily and safely;\n       Whereas the use of the Interstate System has helped the \n     Nation facilitate domestic and global trade, and has allowed \n     the Nation to create unprecedented economic expansion and \n     opportunities for millions of United States citizens;\n       Whereas the Interstate System has enabled diverse \n     communities throughout the United States to come closer \n     together, and has allowed United States citizens to remain \n     connected to each other as well as to the larger world;\n       Whereas the Interstate System has made it easier and more \n     enjoyable for United States citizens to travel to long-\n     distance destinations and spend time with family members and \n     friends who live far away;\n       Whereas the Interstate System is a pivotal link in the \n     national chain of defense and emergency preparedness efforts;\n       Whereas the Interstate System remains 1 of the paramount \n     assets of the United States, as well as a symbol of human \n     ingenuity and freedom;\n       Whereas the anniversary of the Interstate System provides \n     United States citizens with an occasion to honor 1 of the \n     largest public works achievements of all time, and reflect on \n     how the Nation can maintain the effectiveness of the System \n     in the years ahead: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved that the Senate\n       (1) proclaims 2006 as the Golden Anniversary Year of the \n     Dwight D.

Today, the ASPCA is \na national organization that provides services to millions of people \nand their animals. The success of the organization has made the term \nASPCA synonymous with ``animal rescue,'' ``animal shelter,'' ``animal \nadoptions'' and ``humane education.''\n  For over 25 years, my home State of Illinois has hosted the ASPCA's \nAnimal Poison Control Center. The Center is staffed 24 hours a day, 365 \ndays a year by numerous veterinarians and toxicologists who provide a \nunique and valuable service to pet owners and veterinarians. Each year, \ntens of thousands of animal lovers concerned about the health of their \npets contact the Animal Poison Control Center seeking assistance on how \nto relieve their poisoned animals' pain and suffering. I am proud to \nhave the Animal Poison Control Center located in the State of Illinois.\n  I ask my colleagues in the Senate to join me in congratulating the \nstaff, directors and volunteers of the ASPCA on a successful 140 years \nof service.\n  The resolution (S.
