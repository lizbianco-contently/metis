The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                                Schedule\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the nomination of the FDA Commissioner, \nAndrew von Eschenbach. Senators can expect to have this vote around \n10:30 to 10:45 this morning, following the 1 hour for debate. As I \nmentioned yesterday morning, this is a very important position, and to \nhave this confirmation finally being accomplished will be a great \nachievement for this Congress.\n  Once cloture has been invoked, we will try to schedule that vote on \nconfirmation early in the day. There are several critical items the \nSenate must act on before we adjourn sine die, and therefore Senators \nshould adjust their travel plans to be here voting over the coming \ndays.\n  I will be working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to wrap \nup our business for the Congress, and I appreciate Senators' \nwillingness to work together on a number of legislative and executive \nmatters.\n\n\n                   Recognition of the Minority Leader\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                     moving The Legislative Agenda\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Andrew von Eschenbach is cleared on this \nside, so as far as we are concerned there is no need for a cloture \nvote. We look forward to working with the distinguished majority leader \ntoday, maybe tomorrow, maybe Saturday, to try to get as much \ncooperation out of Senators as possible. I know the finance folks have \nworked long and hard to try to come up with something that is very \nimportant for the country. We will continue to monitor that and do \neverything we can as we try to move this legislative agenda forward.\n\n\n                       Protecting American Values\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I want to speak on \nanother matter. I know we want to get to the hour of pre-vote time here \nshortly.\n  Hopefully, tomorrow will officially end the 109th Congress. At the \nend of the day tomorrow, if we do our work today successfully, and \ntonight, the Senate will be able to adjourn. That will also mark, once \nwe adjourn, this official change in leadership and change in the Senate \nagenda. I know many of my colleagues and many of my conservative allies \nview this change with a bit of trepidation, but change is good, change \nis constructive. It can be difficult, it can be painful, and it can be \nmessy, but change forces us all to reexamine who we are, where we are, \nand where we want to go; what we know, what we believe.\n  I believe it is our responsibility to protect traditional, \ncommonsense American values. I believe when we give the American people \nthe freedom to invest their money as they choose, the economy is going \nto flourish. It is going to have more freedom to grow. At the end of \nthe day, I believe good leaders don't talk about principles--don't talk \nabout them--but good leaders lead on principle. They act, and they act \nwith solutions, even if they don't know that the outcome is going to be \n100-percent successful every time a bill is taken to the floor.\n  I think that is one of the things that at least I tried to do, is not \nsay let's only take to the floor what will necessarily pass but what is \nthe right thing to do, on principle; what is the right thing for us to \nbe considering.\n  During my tenure in public office, it is what I tried to do, to lead \non principle and act with solutions. It does come from that surgical \napproach of fixing things, of operating, of action.\n  For example . . . for 10 years, we grappled with the issue of \nInternet gambling. We watched the industry mushroom from a $30 million \nindustry in 1996 to a $12 billion industry today. We watched an \naddiction undermine families, dash dreams, and fray the fabric of a \nmoral society.\n  So we acted with a solution . . . by passing the Internet Gambling \nProhibition and Enforcement Act to provide new enforcement tools to \nprosecute illegal Internet gambling.\n  Let me give you a few more recent examples of how we have led on \nprinciple, and acted with solutions.\n  We passed the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act . . . which \ncreates a national sex offender registry, strengthens measures to \nprevent child pornography, and reinforces laws against child porn.\n  We passed the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, \nwhich renewed the first federal law to strengthen prosecution efforts \nagainst human traffickers.\n  We passed legislation securing the right to prayer in U.S. military \nacademies.\n  We passed legislation protecting the Mount Soledad Memorial Cross.\n  We passed the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act, which allows for the \n10- fold increase of FCC fines for indecency violations.\n  We passed Cord blood legislation that harnesses the power of stem \ncells in cord blood to develop new cures for life-threatening diseases.\n  We passed the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act, which prohibits the \ngestation of fetal tissue in order to use it for research.\n  We passed the Stem Cell Research Alternatives bill, which provides \nfederal funding for a variety of stem cell research that do not involve \ndestroying human embryos.\n  And perhaps most notably . . . we confirmed John Roberts Chief \nJustice of the Supreme Court . . . and Samuel Alito as an associate \nJustice of the Supreme Court.\n  We confirmed 18 Circuit court nominees and 87 District court judges, \nincluding six previously obstructed nominees. America needs judges who \nare fair, independent, unbiased, and committed to equal justice under \nthe law . . . and we made sure that's what America got.\n  Over the past 12 years, what Republicans have done has changed our \neconomy, our country, and our way of life for the better.\n  Our record of success, combined with the lessons of November's \nelection, ensures that our party will rededicate itself to serving the \ninterests of America, both here at home and around the world.\n  That vision--optimistic, forward-looking, hopeful--will be grounded \nin the fundamentals of commonsense conservative values best found on \nMain Street and in families with whom we have the privilege of \ninteracting all across the country.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes for debate prior to the cloture vote, with time divided as \nfollows: the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, or his designee, 30 \nminutes; the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, 20 minutes; the Senator \nfrom Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, 10 minutes.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the pending nomination of \nDr. Andrew von Eschenbach to be the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The \nFDA has a very broad and critical mission in protecting our public \nhealth. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs is in\n\n[[Page S11405]]\n\ncharge of an agency that regulates $1 trillion worth of products a \nyear. The FDA ensures the safety and effectiveness of all drugs, \nbiological products such as vaccines, medical devices, and animal drugs \nand feed. Let me repeat that: the safety and effectiveness of all \ndrugs, biological products such as vaccines, medical devices, animal \ndrugs and feed. It also oversees the safety of a vast variety of food \nproducts, as well as medical and consumer products including cosmetics.\n  As Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Dr. von Eschenbach would be \nresponsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed \ninnovations in its mission areas, and by helping the public get \naccurate, science-based information on medicines and food. Dr. von \nEschenbach has a strong record. He is an accomplished scientist, a \nproven manager, and a man with a vision. He is also a cancer survivor, \nand he has brought that perspective, and the compassion that goes with \nit, to his Government service. He gave up a job he loved, a challenging \nbut rewarding post directing the National Cancer Institute, to offer \nhis service for what I believe is a much more challenging and \ndefinitely thankless job of leading the FDA.\n  The FDA has been without a confirmed Commissioner for all but 18 \nmonths of the last 5\\1/2\\ years. Have you ever seen a business that can \nrun for 5\\1/2\\ years without a boss except for 18 months? And that was \na tenuous 18 months. I believe we can all agree that we need a strong \nleader at the FDA now, and one who has a mandate to act. He needs full \nauthority to bring back the morale of the Department and get the job \ndone. We must be forward looking. There are many items before the FDA \nthat require the immediate attention of an FDA Commissioner vested with \nfull authority. But that authority flows directly from the act of \nSenate confirmation. Without a Senate-confirmed leader, we can't expect \nthe FDA to be as effective as we need it to be. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider this.\n  I know some of my colleagues on and off the committee are not \ncompletely satisfied with their interactions with the FDA during Dr. \nvon Eschenbach's tenure. Some would urge that the Food and Drug \nAdministration move quickly on certain matters before it. However, I am \nnot sure that holding up a nomination over single products or single \nissues is the right way to achieve faster action and to ensure that \nagency processes are free from the pressure of politics. In fact, I \nstrongly believe the opposite would occur. I think this is a position \nthat has more Catch-22s than any other position in Government.\n  I do respect the right of my colleagues to disagree with the \nPresident's choice for this position or the policies a President's \nnominee might pursue. If our disagreements with the President's choice \nare so strong, we ought to vote against the nominee. But, in light of \nthe trillion dollars worth of drugs and products overseen by the FDA \nand hundreds of drug approvals reviewed every year, I think we would be \nsetting a dangerous precedent if any of us hold up the President's \nchoice for FDA Commissioner over decisions made involving one product \nor one issue or something extraneous, even, to the Food and Drug \nAdministration. It would be an especially dangerous precedent at this \npoint.\n  We have a lot on our plate with respect to the FDA during the 110th \nCongress. We have to reauthorize both the drug and device user fee \nprograms, address two expiring pediatric programs, and improve our drug \nsafety system.\n  The FDA needs a leader with the backing and mandate that Senate \nconfirmation provides in order to be our partner in these efforts. Dr. \nvon Eschenbach has received significant support from the HELP \nCommittee. This man could serve patients in many different ways, and \nhas offered to serve them by running this critically important agency. \nI am talking about a doctor with cancer expertise, management \nexpertise, and vision, who has agreed to run this agency at what we pay \nbecause he wants to give back to his country.\n  I urge my colleagues who are not on our committee to give Dr. von \nEschenbach a chance to effectively run the FDA with full statutory \nauthority, so I urge my colleagues to accept the President's nominee, \nDr. Andrew von Eschenbach, and vote to confirm him as the next \nCommissioner of Food and Drugs. Voting yes on this cloture vote will be \nthe first step voting on a permanent head to oversee our Nation's food \nand drug system.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my opposition to the cloture motion is \nas much about whether we are going to be able to fulfill our \nconstitutional responsibilities of oversight of the administrative \nbranch of Government as it is about the particular qualifications of \nthe nominee. I intend to vote against cloture and I hope that Democrats \nwho are listening--particularly those Democrats in the last election \nwho were bellyaching because there wasn't any oversight on the part of \nRepublicans toward the executive branch of Government--would pay \nattention to the fact that this nominee has something to do with and is \nan illustration of the lack of cooperation on the part of the executive \nbranch, failure to cooperate with Congress on the issue of \ncongressional oversight.\n  I have serious concerns about what this cloture vote means, then, to \ncongressional oversight of the executive branch now and in the future, \nand what it means for Members such as me, who placed a hold on this \nnominee. This was not a secret hold. I made this hold public.\n  I am voting against cloture and ask my colleagues to join me because \nI believe we need to send a message to the executive branch that it is \nnot OK to impede congressional investigations. It is not OK to limit \nthe Senate's access to documents, information, and employees of the \nexecutive branch. In his book on congressional government, Woodrow \nWilson, before he was President, when he was a professor at Princeton, \nwrote, in 1885: ``Quite as important as lawmaking is vigilant oversight \nof the administration.''\n  Our work as lawmakers does not end with the passage of a bill. This \nbody has a responsibility to the American people to make sure that laws \nwork and that they are being implemented effectively, efficiently, and \neconomically. Congressional oversight serves very important goals, and \nwe should not lose sight. They include reviewing actions taken and \nregulations adopted by executive agencies to make sure that the \nagencies are executing law according to the intent of Congress, and, \nsecond, ensuring that the Federal Government is not wasting taxpayers' \ndollars. Oversight work allows us to evaluate the ability of agencies \nand managers to carry out program objectives and improve the \nefficiency, effectiveness, and economy of Government programs; next, \nensuring that executive policies reflect the public interest and that \npublic interest is expressed in the laws of Congress; and, lastly, \nprotecting the rights and liberties of the American people.\n  Woodrow Wilson also said in his book that:\n\n       It is the proper duty of a representative body to look \n     diligently into every affair of Government and to talk much \n     about what it sees. It is meant to be the eyes, the voice and \n     embody the wisdom and the will of its constituents.\n\n  In America, with our Government, the public's business ought to be \npublic. But when you have coverups and the lack of information going to \nCongress, as demonstrated by this request for documents, and when we \nget a document back with practically 57 pages removed, what is in those \n57 pages that we ought to have access to? That is just one example of \nlack of information and the lack of cooperation from this agency.\n  Throughout history, Congress has engaged in oversight of the \nexecutive branch. The right to congressional oversight has been \nasserted from the earliest days of our Republic. In 1792, the House \ninvoked its authority to conduct oversight when it appointed a \ncommittee to investigate the defeat of General St. Clair and his Army \nby Indians in the Northwest and empowered the ``call for such persons, \npapers, and records as may be necessary'' for that inquiry.\n  In fact, the Constitution grants Congress extensive authority to \noversee and investigate executive branch activities.\n  Congressional oversight was also recognized explicitly in the passage \nof the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946,\n\n[[Page S11406]]\n\nwhich required the standing committees of Congress to exercise \ncontinuous watchfulness over programs of agencies in their \njurisdiction. Numerous Supreme Court decisions will support all the \nprecedents for Congress to see all aspects of the Federal Government.\n  In 1927, in McGrain v. Daugherty, the Supreme Court upheld \ncongressional authority to conduct oversight of the Teapot Dome \nscandal. Justice Van Devanter writing for the unanimous Court stated:\n\n       We are of the opinion that the power of inquiry with the \n     process to enforce it is an essential and appropriate \n     auxiliary to the legislative function.\n\n  To do oversight, Congress needs access to information and people in \nthe executive branch. And that is what I did not, and still may not, be \ngetting from the FDA under the leadership of Dr. Von Eschenbach--as an \nexample, 47 pages removed; another example, 43 pages removed.\n  How are you going to conduct oversight when you get answers such as \nthat from the Food and Drug Administration?\n  I take exception to the statement made in support of the cloture \nmotion. People ought to be ashamed of saying Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach \nhas done a superb job in the position he is currently occupying with an \nanswer such as that to the Congress of the United States. That is an \ninsult. Before you cast your vote in favor of cloture, consider what is \nat stake--and particularly Members on the other side of the aisle who, \nduring the campaign, in campaign commercial after campaign commercial \nafter campaign commercial, said Congress is not doing its job of \noversight, implying that Republicans were covering up wrongdoing by the \nadministration. If you want to preserve your access to information and \ndo the oversight that you think you are going to do, when you are in \nthe majority and you get answers such as that, do you think you are \ngoing to be able to do the job of oversight?\n  In my interactions with the Department of Health and Human Services \nand the FDA these last 8 months, I have seen a complete and utter \ndisrespect for congressional authority and hence the law. The \ndepartment and the Food and Drug Administration have repeatedly failed \nto act in good faith in responding to congressional investigations--and \nthe lack of 43 pages is just one example.\n  Although the Director's leadership at the FDA has failed to fully \ncomply with two congressional subpoenas that were issued 7 months ago, \nefforts to accommodate the agency's concerns fall on deaf ears, and I \nwonder if I am dealing with dysfunction by design. Not only has the \nNEDA withheld documents that do not appear to be privileged, but it \nalso says what has been withheld and why. The subpoenas compel a \nprivilege log, but the FDA has not provided us with that privilege log.\n  For Democrats in the majority next year doing the oversight that they \nsaid they were going to do because Republicans weren't doing it--they \ndidn't let me--let me ask you this: Are you going to be able to conduct \noversight when you get answers such as that? Are you going to be able \nto conduct oversight when, for 7 months, you don't get your subpoenas \nresponded to? What is the agency's explanation? The FDA has said that \nmany documents have been withheld, that it is unduly burdensome to \nprovide a privilege log. Even in the FDA, general counsel, as recently \nas Tuesday of this week, could not see why the agency needed to comply \nwith the law and the terms of the subpoena which was issued by the \ncommittee.\n  In denying the committee access to the documents responsive to the \nsubpoena, which the department and the FDA administration have claimed \n``prosecutorial deliberative process'' or ``confidential \ncommunications'' or ``agency prerogatives'' to determine who will be \ninterviewed and testify before a jurisdictional committee, when those \non the other side of the aisle get answers such as that when you are \ngoing to be in the majority, what are you going to do about it? Are you \ngoing to keep your commitment to the American people when you won the \nmajority? And are you going to be able to do the oversight when you get \nrationales such as ``prosecutorial deliberative process'' or \n``confidential communications'' or ``agency prerogatives?''\n  I could not talk to a line agent named West because you can't talk to \nline agents, when 3 months before I talked to line agents? There was \nsomeone from the Justice Department before the Judiciary Committee, \nwhen Senator Kennedy said, ``I want access to line agents,'' unrelated \nto what I am talking about: Line Agent West, whom I wanted to talk to \nand I was told I couldn't talk to because you can't talk to line \nagents, the official at the Justice Department said to Senator Kennedy:\n\n       You can talk to line agents. We will get them for you.\n\n  I do not know whether that ever happened. But that was the answer.\n  When I went around doing my questioning of Justice Department \nofficials, I said: What about my ability to talk to Line Agent West? It \njust seemed as if I was going to be able to talk to Line Agent West. \nBut yet this very day the Justice Department is advising the Secretary \nof the Interior that we can't talk to Line Agent West, which is key to \nwhether some of these investigations are allowing dangerous drugs on \nthe market. In Cedar Rapids, IA, I have a family that lost an 18-year-\nold because of a drug that was on the market then and which is not on \nthe market now.\n  It seems to me that if you are concerned about the safety of drugs, \nthis information is important, and if you are going to have it covered \nup in the FDA, you aren't protecting the public. If Congress knows \nabout it, you are not doing your job of oversight.\n  This past summer I asked the Congressional Research Service to look \ninto the department's policies regarding this matter. And the \nCongressional Research Service told me that there is ``no legal basis'' \nfor the department's executive branch assertion. The legal analysis \nprovided by Congressional Research Service supports the committee's \nposition that these executive agencies' claims have been consistently \nrejected and compliance with congressional requests in the past has \nbeen forthcoming. The CRS cites numerous court cases which establish \nand support Congress's power to engage in oversight and investigate \nactivities and its access to executive branch personnel and documents \nin carrying out our powers of oversight.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services, the FDA within Health \nand Human Services, says it has been responsive because the agency made \navailable hundreds of thousands--even millions--of pages of documents \nto the Finance Committee in response to its subpoena. But the agency \ncan give me all of the books and all the documents housed at the \nLibrary of Congress and it won't matter if it is not what I have asked \nfor and the pages are removed.\n  It is this type of cooperation that I am getting under this Director \nthat you are now going to confirm. I am very concerned about the \ncooperation, if any, that we have once he becomes a permanent \ncommissioner. Every Member of Congress should be equally concerned if \nthey take their constitutional duty of conducting oversight of the \nexecutive branch seriously, and most importantly to the new majority \nwhen you are going to carry out your campaign promises to make sure \nthat there is proper oversight, checks and balances against an \nexecutive branch of Government you think is exceeding authority. Every \nMember should be concerned. I cannot emphasis this enough.\n  A vote for cloture today is a vote against oversight, and that is not \nwhat this Senate should be doing. It is not what the American people \nsent us here to do. We need to step up congressional oversight to \nprotect our Nation's system of checks and balances and not reward those \nwho seek to impede our constitutional authority.\n  This body should not walk hand in hand with the executive branch and \nsit idly by as instances of abuse and fraud continue to endanger the \nhealth and safety of American people. This Senate needs to make it \nclear to the executive branch that Congress takes its oversight \nresponsibilities seriously and to vote against cloture. If we do have \ncloture, I will have other remarks during postcloture debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I want to briefly comment.\n  I understand the frustration. I have been working with him trying to \nget documents, trying to get the interview\n\n[[Page S11407]]\n\nwith Mr. West. I want you to put yourself in Dr. Von Eschenbach's \nposition. He has not been confirmed. He does not have the full \nauthority to run that department. So what he has to do is rely on the \nDepartment of Justice, as the Senator mentioned. The Department of \nJustice tells him what he is supposed to do. I don't think he has \nauthority to go beyond what the Department of Justice says.\n  The Senator is one of the most diligent Members to hold oversight \nhearings of anybody that I know. I appreciate the depth that you go to \nfor individuals as well as groups. I know it is what you are doing on \nthis one. Unless we give him full authority, he has to rely on the \nJustice Department. The way one has to take on the Department of \nJustice is through the Judiciary Committee and bring them to task for \ngiving him that kind of advice. I think he is just following the advice \nhe has gotten from those he has to rely on until he has authority. I \nthink it will be different when he has full authority.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, during my time of almost 7 years as \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have met with Dr. Von \nEschenbach quite often. We had many requests for documents. I can't \nremember once that he refused. But beyond that, I came to the floor \ntoday to say that I have gotten to know Dr. Von Eschenbach personally, \nand I can't think of a more qualified man at this time to be confirmed \nto this position. I hope the Senate will vote cloture and we will \nconfirm Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach as requested by the President. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank Senator Enzi for giving me \nthis time. I am pleased to rise to support Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach's \nnomination for Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. I am \nspeaking about a person whom I know. I know him as a person. I know him \nas a human being. I can say, with full confidence, there is no one more \nqualified and more well suited to lead this very important agency.\n  I was very pleased the committee overwhelmingly, unanimously, \nsupported his nomination. Not only is Dr. Von Eschenbach a wonderful \nfriend of mine, but he is so qualified for this position. His \nexperience and integrity make him the right choice to lead the FDA.\n  He is a nationally recognized urologic surgeon, medical educator, and \ncancer advocate. He is a three-time cancer survivor. There is no one \nwho can understand what it is like to go through a fight against cancer \nthan someone who has done it. So many doctors haven't had that \nexperience, one might not get the impression that they really \nunderstand what a patient is going through. Not Dr. Andy von \nEschenbach. He has been through the hard time of being told he has this \ndreaded disease and fighting it with all his might. He does relate to \npatients' struggles.\n  During his 25 years at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Medical \nCenter, he led a faculty of 1,000 cancer researchers and clinicians. He \nwas the chief academic officer at this great cancer institution. He was \nalso the founding director of M.D. Anderson's Prostate Cancer Research \nProgram. In this position, he developed integrated programs to study, \ntreat, and prevent prostate cancer. Before arriving at M.D. Anderson, \nhe served his country as lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy Medical \nCorps from 1968 to 1971. In 1976, he joined M.D. Anderson as a urologic \noncology fellow. He became part of the faculty and was named chairman \nof the Department of Urology in 1983.\n  When he left M.D. Anderson in 2002, he became Director of the \nNational Cancer Institute. At the time, he was president-elect of the \nAmerican Cancer Society which, of course, is one of the leading \norganizations in our country that fights for victims of cancer.\n  He has, also, been published in more than 200 publications. This \nyear, Time Magazine named Andy von Eschenbach as one of the 100 people \nwho shape our world.\n  The FDA is fortunate to have Dr. von Eschenbach. It is one of the \nNation's oldest and most respected consumer protection agencies. It \nregulates $1 trillion worth of products available to American \nconsumers, and it makes sure the products are safe and effective.\n  Dr. Von Eschenbach is the right person to lead the FDA's mission. I \ncompletely trust him. I cannot think of a more qualified candidate. I \nhope we will put politics aside in this very important nomination and \nwe will confirm this very qualified individual. He is balanced. He has \ngood judgment. He will continue to be a cancer advocate as well as a \npatient advocate.\n  He knows, also, from the FDA standpoint, of the issues involved with \nthe drug approval process--that products face extensive testing and \nstudies compared to other countries. I have talked to him about this. \nOf course, their first and foremost responsibility is safety. That is \nwhy they have this arduous and comprehensive process of approving \ndrugs.\n  On the other hand, he also knows you need to make drugs available for \npatients who otherwise may not survive. He realizes these concerns from \nevery angle. He knows it from the research angle, from the academic \nangle, from the Government angle, and from the patient advocate angle.\n  It would be a tragedy if we did not give him the full authority and \nthe full congressional confirmation he deserves. He deserves it because \nhe left the private sector at a world renowned cancer research \ninstitution to serve his country and the responsibility it takes in a \nhigh public policy position.\n  Sometimes I wonder how we attract such qualified academics and people \nwho are not experienced in this arena. They are not used to the \ncompromise of politics. They have been researchers and in academia all \ntheir lives. They come into public service and all of a sudden they are \nhit with the public exposure and scrutiny. Sometimes they are unfairly \ncharacterized in a way they never dreamed.\n  Yet we have someone of the caliber of Andy von Eschenbach willing to \ntake all of that to do something better for our country and for cancer \npatients in the country and in the world. We owe him the ability to \nhave this position without any further delay, with the complete \nimprimatur of the Senate as well as the President of the United States. \nHe deserves it.\n  I hope our colleagues will look at this, not from a political prism \nbut from the standpoint of a qualified individual who is trying to help \nmedical research and safety in this country go forward, who is a \npatient advocate, first and foremost.\n  I thank Senator Enzi and Senator Kennedy for working together to \nbring this nomination to the Senate. We should have a bipartisan vote \nin confirming Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I rise today to speak against the \ncloture motion to confirm Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach as Commissioner of \nthe FDA. I have had a public hold on this nomination and have been very \nupfront about it. Because my serious concerns have not been addressed \nin any significant way, I will vote against cloture. If cloture is \ninvoked, I will vote against the nomination.\n  In doing so, I want to be clear I have nothing against Dr. Von \nEschenbach's technical credentials or professional experience. They are \nvery impressive in many ways. I strongly object to this nomination \nbecause the FDA and Dr. Von Eschenbach, acting on orders from the \nadministration, has had a complete and utter lack of action creating a \nreasonable, safe system for reimportation of prescription drugs from \nCanada and elsewhere.\n  Clearly, this nomination making him the permanent head of the FDA \nwill only further delay that reasonable implementation of a good, safe \nreimportation policy. In fact, at my extensive meeting with Dr. Von \nEschenbach, my discussion with him made that perfectly clear. I give \nhim credit, I suppose, for being very direct about that, although I am \nnot sure he fully understood my serious interest in reimportation. It \nis for this reason I will vote against cloture. If cloture is invoked, \nI will vote against the nomination.\n\n[[Page S11408]]\n\n  The FDA is completely capable of setting up a reimportation system, \none that is safe and effective. The FDA can do this. It is not a matter \nof technical ability. We have great technical and other resources in \nthis country. It is a matter of political will. At any time, the FDA \ncould act and set up this safe and reasonable system.\n\n  My hold on this nomination, as I said, was very public, upfront, and \nclear. I made it clear I would lift it, contingent on a very simple \nrequest to implement some sort of prescription drug reimportation \nplan--perhaps beginning with personal reimportation from Canada, \nincluding Internet and mail order sales. The FDA could do this. It is \nfully capable of doing this. It has the know-how to do this. It simply \nwill not because of lack of political will.\n  The need for this is very obvious to me. Every time I talk to \nconsumers in Louisiana, particularly seniors, it becomes more and more \nobvious. As obvious and as important is the growing support for this--\nnot just out in the country where that support has always been strong \nbut in the Congress, in the Senate, in the House.\n  The House passed comprehensive drug reimportation language in 2003. \nIt passed it by an overwhelming majority. More recently, the Senate \npassed my amendment coauthored by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida by a \nvote of 68 to 32. That was this past July. That was a significant \nbreakthrough because it was the first time we had a meaningful, \nstraight up-or-down vote on a reimportation issue in the Senate. Again, \nthe vote was clear. It was overwhelming. That important amendment \npassed 68 to 32.\n  All this shows that the majority of Americans strongly support \nallowing all Americans to purchase safe, cheaper prescription drugs \nfrom Canada and elsewhere. Yet the administration absolutely refuses to \nbudge. Not only does the administration refuse to budge, it even went \nso far as to quietly implement a new policy last year at U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection to go after individual American citizens crossing \nback into the United States from other countries--mostly Canada--with \nmedicine, actually seizing their packages containing legal medication \nat those border checkpoints. That is a very high-handed policy, when \nthese citizens are doing nothing but trying to get absolutely necessary \nprescription drugs at a reasonable cost.\n  Coupled with the FDA and the administration's stubborn reluctance to \nimplement even the most modern program, this has led me to conclude \nthat no change would be made with the confirmation of this nominee.\n  Again, this is an issue of utmost importance to every American family \nand, of course, it particularly impacts seniors. I talk to affected \nfamilies and affected seniors in Louisiana about this all the time. \nThey tell me, at a time when pharmaceutical companies are making record \nprofits, the costs of prescription drugs are still skyrocketing and the \nvery same medicines usually manufactured by the very same companies are \nsold at a fraction of the costs a few miles north of the border in \nCanada or in other countries around the world. Louisianians see that \nand they are very skeptical. They should be. I share that attitude. I \nshare that skepticism.\n  Opposing the right of an American to buy prescription drugs, FDA-\napproved medication they intend to use for themselves, is a wrong \npolicy. We pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs \nin America. Our prices subsidize not only rockbottom prices in almost \nevery other country but also sky-high and escalating profits of the \npharmaceutical companies. That is not fair. That should not be allowed \nto continue. That is why we need to pass this important policy of \nreimportation.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken about this significant issue in the \nSenate.\n  In September, my colleague from Michigan spoke of her bus trips with \nher constituents to Canada where they were able to buy safe, FDA-\napproved drugs at a fraction of the U.S. cost: Lipitor, a very \nimportant cholesterol-lowering drug, for 40 percent less; Prevacid, an \nulcer medication, for 50 percent less; antidepression medications such \nas Zyprexa for 70 percent less.\n  In June, my colleague from North Dakota spoke eloquently about the \nneed to allow the reimportation of safe drugs as a way to pressure U.S. \npharmaceutical companies to lower prices here. That is the key, not \njust offering this option of cheaper drugs from another source but \nbreaking up the present system that allows companies to charge \ndramatically different prices for the same drug around the world. And, \nof course, the highest prices in the world by far are right here in the \nUnited States. That system will not be able to withstand reimportation. \nThat system will fall with reimportation.\n  So that is why I continue this fight. That is why it is so important. \nAlthough certainly this nominee may very well be confirmed by the \nSenate today, I am very optimistic that, as we make progress on this \nissue, we march to a very certain victory, probably next year, on the \nissue.\n  Again, we have been making steady progress. My amendment this past \nsummer--the first vote on the floor of the Senate--was a breakthrough \nvote that showed overwhelming support here on the floor of the Senate \nfor reimportation. Previous House votes, similarly, showed not just \nmajority support, overwhelming support for this change in policy. Just \nrecently, I again joined with Senator Bill Nelson of Florida to put up \nanother important amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill that \nwould go a step further. We will continue to pursue that. Then, next \nyear, I fully expect a full-blown reimportation plan to be here on the \nfloor of the Senate for a full debate and a fair vote.\n  So as I oppose cloture, as I oppose this nomination, I do so in that \nspirit and with real optimism that we are not only making progress, but \nwe will, in fact, win on this issue in the near future. Next year, I \nexpect my bill to be fully debated. In this Congress, that bill is S. \n109, the Pharmaceutical Market Access Act. I believe it will reach the \nfloor and will get a full debate with other significant bills on the \nissue next year.\n  I look forward to that continued progress. I look forward to that \nultimate victory because Americans, particularly seniors, all across \nour country, including in Louisiana, need this very important relief. \nWe can give them this relief in a safe, reliable way to dramatically \nbring down prescription drug prices.\n  With that, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the intense, \nenthusiastic, and persistent work of the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. \nVitter, for drug importation. I do not know that I have seen anybody \nlead as much on an issue or work as hard on an issue. Around here, that \nis a talent which is very much appreciated.\n  I do want to mention that, again, Dr. Von Eschenbach has not been \nconfirmed, so he does not have full authority to run the Department or \nto do what he would like to do or might need to do. He has to rely on \nthe advice of other people, particularly until he is confirmed. After \nthat, even then, he will have to abide by the laws.\n  I would point out that drug importation is illegal right now, and it \nis Congress, not the FDA, that has determined that. So until we change \nthe law, until we do some or all of the things the Senator from \nLouisiana is suggesting, Dr. Von Eschenbach would really be stepping \nout of bounds to do drug importation. So I hope we do not hold that \nagainst him or hold up his nomination for that reason. We should hold \nhim accountable for what is within his control, but urge him to work \nwith Congress.\n  I have had dozens of meetings with him on a variety of issues, as \nSenators have brought them up. Most of them have been resolved. Those \nwithin the law, those the Department of Justice has not contested, have \nbeen resolved.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield very briefly?\n  Mr. ENZI. Yes.\n  Mr. VITTER. Just very briefly, first of all, I appreciate your kind \ncomments. Very briefly, my comments regarding his and FDA's ability to \nmove forward on this is based on current law, including the Medicare \nModernization Act, which says that if they institute a safety regime \nand certify the safety of these drugs, they can, in fact, move forward \nwith the reimportation regime.\n\n[[Page S11409]]\n\nSo under present law, that is possible, and that is what I was \nreferring to. But I respect the Senator's point of view.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I appreciate that comment. If you were a person who was in \na catch-22 position, a very qualified doctor, and you really wanted to \ndo a good job with FDA and you knew that half the people or a third of \nthe people or even 10 percent of the people did not want drug \nimportation and you were the guy in charge of maybe making this \ndetermination for the first time--even though 6 or 8 years previously \nCongress had opposite opinions on it--I do not think you would want to \nput yourself in that position.\n  He has just had a number of catch-22 positions where he can irritate \nhalf or more of us by making a decision, and nobody is going to make a \ndecision in their confirmation process that way.\n  It is actually the Health and Human Services Secretary who has to \ncertify under the new law as well.\n  So I hope we can get him confirmed and then do the kind of oversight \nwe need to do to make sure he does everything that is possible to make \nsure we have safe food and drugs.\n  Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I did not plan to talk about drug \nreimportation, but coming on the heels of this conversation, I simply \nwant to make this one observation: The key statement made by the \nSenator from Louisiana was safe drug reimportation. And the key problem \nhere is certifying that the drugs coming across the border--after they \nhave been sent and then are reimported are, in fact, the same drugs, \nthey are, in fact, safe.\n  The Congress has said the drugs can be reimported back into the \nUnited States as soon as the Secretary can certify that they are, in \nfact, safe. I have seen the sample runs, if you will, that have been \nmade on this issue. They have found again and again that a certain \npercentage of the drugs coming back are, in fact, not drugs \nmanufactured in the United States. They have been manufactured \nelsewhere, packaged in Canada or Mexico or wherever, and then sent back \nto the United States fraudulently, as if they were, in fact, the \noriginal drugs.\n  Now, they have not yet killed anybody that I know of. They are not so \nunsafe that they have, in fact, poisoned anybody. Overwhelmingly, the \nhistory has been that the dosage in the drugs is simply not the same as \nadvertised in the drugs manufactured in the United States. They have \ntraces of whatever the drug might be in the fraudulent packages, but \nthe dose control is not the same, and it is dangerous to the individual \ntaking the drug if he or she assumes they are getting a certain dosage \nand, in fact, they are getting less.\n  That has been the challenge. That has been the problem. And until the \nSecretary of HHS, be it Donna Shalala or Michael Leavitt, can come \nforward and certify that all of these are, in fact, as advertised, it \nis the law that they cannot be brought into the United States. I think \nthat is an appropriate law protecting people in the United States.\n  I agree with the Senator from Wyoming that it really is not \nappropriate to hold up Dr. Von Eschenbach's confirmation on this issue \nbecause it has to be decided by the scientists and those who are doing \nthe sampling of the shipments rather than the head of the FDA.\n  I have gotten to know Dr. Von Eschenbach as the chairman of the \nAgriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. You usually think of \nagricultural appropriations in terms of crop supports and USDA \nactivities. But for whatever reason, in its wisdom, Congress at one \npoint put jurisdiction over the Food and Drug Administration into that \nsubcommittee. So, if you will, I have been in the position of dealing \nwith this man as he has come begging.\n  As we are in the Appropriations subcommittees, everybody who has \nresponsibility over which we have control comes begging; that is, they \ncome asking for things, they come outlining their position, and they \ncome describing what they will do with the money. All of us who have \nbeen on the Appropriations Committee have had this experience with a \nwide variety of people from the executive branch. I have never seen \nanyone who has come before our subcommittee better prepared, with a \nbetter understanding of how the money will be spent, and with more \nvision as to where the money ought to be spent to take the agency into \nthe future than Dr. Von Eschenbach.\n  We have not just sat and discussed budget issues; we have not just \nsat and talked about dollars and cents--what are you going to spend \nhere and what are you going to spend there--he has outlined for me in \nour conversations where he thinks the FDA of the future ought to be and \nwhat it will cost to get it there.\n  I have been very struck and impressed by his vision for the FDA. This \nis not a man who is content to simply superintend what he has on his \nplate. This is a man who has the capacity to look to the horizon, and \nmaybe even over the horizon, to see where America ought to be.\n  In the practice of medicine right now, drug therapy is the cutting \nedge. Yes, we are developing new operations. We are developing new \nsurgical procedures to try to push the envelope out further as far as \nhealth care is concerned. But the major breakthroughs are coming \nthrough drug therapy. There are all kinds of situations now where it \ncan be handled with drug therapy that obviates the need for an \noperation or any kind of surgical intrusion. The implications of that \nare huge, and the role of the FDA in that kind of medical revolution of \nthe future is paramount. We absolutely have to have at the head of the \nFDA, in that kind of revolution, a man who is visionary, a man who \nlooks to the future, and a man who understands the potential that lies \nin the area which he superintends.\n  Dr. Von Eschenbach, I am convinced, is such a man. I have his resume. \nWe have heard it outlined here. It is an outstanding resume. But people \nwith good resumes can come before us all the time and, in fact, have no \nvision. They spend their time tending what is on their own plate. This \nis a man with vision. This is a man who sees what can happen and who \ndesperately wants to take the FDA in that direction.\n  He said to me: Senator, I don't feel that I can institute these kinds \nof long-term changes as long as I am acting. I feel--I think \nappropriately, from my point of view--that I cannot make these kinds of \nstructural changes in FDA's mission and direction until I have the \nimprimatur of the U.S. Senate and full confirmation.\n  The longer we hold up his nomination, the longer we keep him from \nbeing confirmed, the longer we will wait for that kind of vision to be \nestablished in that agency. I think we have waited too long. I salute \nthe majority leader for his persistence in bringing this nomination to \nthe floor. At this time, with all the other things we have to do before \nthis Congress comes to an end, this is one he could easily have put \noff. I am grateful that he did not. I am grateful that he filed a \ncloture motion to hold our feet to the fire on this one and say: It is \ntime for us to act. It is time for us to give this man the imprimatur \nof our confirmation vote so he can move forward, he can infuse the \nagency with the kind of vision and excitement that I know he has.\n  I have spent enough time with him, I have had enough conversation \nwith him--have talked to his peers outside of the agency to know that \nthe President has made an outstanding choice in Dr. Von Eschenbach. We \nas a country would be well served to have him in this place, and I urge \nthe Senate to invoke cloture and confirm this nomination as quickly as \nwe possibly can.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, to me it is simply unconscionable that the \nFood and Drug Administration, one of the best little agencies in \nGovernment, has gone leaderless for such a period of time.\n  Here we have an agency that governs, by some estimates, 25 cents out \nof every consumer dollar, and yet we treat it as a stepchild. We do not \nprovide it with the funding it needs. We allow it to exist without a \nconfirmed commissioner for months and months on end, for repeated \nperiods. And yet we expect it to be the vital consumer watchdog agency \nit was intended to be.\n  When you think about what this agency does, what the daily business \nof the FDA is, you can see how dire the situation really is.\n  This is an agency that makes certain the drugs and medical devices we \nuse\n\n[[Page S11410]]\n\nare safe and effective, that the cosmetics, dietary supplements, and \nover-the-counter medications we count on are sold safely, with truthful \nand nonmisleading claims. This agency regulates animal drugs and \nradiological devices and so much more. Yet, time after time, it does \nwithout a confirmed commissioner. And this is the absolutely wrong time \nfor that to happen.\n  Think about the key FDA issues we are facing: the safety of the food \nsupply, how to improve drug safety, instituting a new system of \nmandatory adverse event reporting for serious events associated with \nthe use of dietary supplements and nonprescription drugs, extending the \nuser fee programs for drugs and devices, and the incentives for \npediatric drug testing--and I have named only a few of the issues. We \nare facing all these pressing public policy issues, and yet we expect \nthe agency to do its job without a confirmed commissioner. That is not \nright. It is simply not right.\n  The President has nominated a well-qualified, more-than-capable \nmedical doctor to the position of Commissioner of Food and Drugs.\n  I know Dr. Von Eschenbach well. He is a man of integrity. He is a \ngood manager. He is a good listener. He knows the importance of working \nwell with Congress, and I believe he will work well with us.\n  I urge my colleagues--no, I implore my colleagues--to do what is \nright and vote to invoke cloture on this nomination. It is what Dr. Von \nEschenbach deserves. It is what the agency deserves. And it is what the \nAmerican people deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah for his \ndelightful comments. He speaks so clearly and explains things so well. \nI know of his contacts with Dr. Von Eschenbach. I hope people will \nfollow his advice and vote for cloture.\n  Dr. Von Eschenbach's qualifications are excellent. He is supported by \nmany organizations. We had received a number of letters in support of \nhis nomination prior to his confirmation hearing. Those were duly \nentered in the hearing record. However, since then we have received \nadditional letters of support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       Omeris,\n\n                                     Columbus, OH, August 2, 2006.\n       Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Enzi: On behalf of Omeris, Ohio's bioscience \n     membership and development organization, and our member \n     companies, I am writing in support of the nomination of Dr. \n     Andrew von Eschenbach to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n       Dr. von Eschenbach is an excellent choice to head the FDA. \n     He has an outstanding career as a physician, researcher, and \n     administrator in both the public and the private sectors. As \n     a physician, he has treated cancer patients for almost thirty \n     years. As a researcher, he has published more than 200 \n     articles and books and was the founding director of M.D. \n     Anderson's Prostate Cancer Research Program. As an \n     administrator, he has served as the president-elect to the \n     American Cancer Society.\n       It is critically important to our industry and to the \n     nation that the position of the FDA Commissioner be filled. \n     Strong leadership is essential if the FDA is to most \n     effectively fulfill its mission of assuring the food \n     Americans eat is safe and healthful, that the drugs they take \n     are safe and effective, and that the medical devices they \n     rely on for cures and treatment are safe and effective and \n     represent the latest and best that our industry can offer. \n     Experience has shown that a permanent director continued by \n     the Senate is necessary to assure that the agency has the \n     authoritative leadcrship it needs to respond promptly and \n     effectively to all the challenges it faces.\n       Prompt confirmation of Dr. von Eschenbach is especially \n     important in view of the issues that are currently facing the \n     FDA. Next year, both the medical device and drug user fee \n     programs must be renewed by Congress, and the agreements \n     between industry and the FDA that will be the starting point \n     for the reauthorization are being negotiated right now. The \n     critical path initiative, which offers so much potential for \n     speeding the development and approval of safe and effective \n     products) is just getting off the ground and needs a strong \n     advocate. The challenge of determining how FDA can most \n     effectively conduct postmarket surveillance to assure the \n     safety and effectiveness of approved products is an issue \n     that needs strong leadership from the top. The continuing \n     challenges of food safety and preparation for a pandemic or \n     bioterrorist attack need a strong FDA voice.\n       Omeris members, Ohio's bioscience companies, help \n     revitalize our state's economy while developing critical \n     tools, treatments, and technologies that benefit the world. \n     Omeris is a focal point for the bioscience and biotechnology \n     community, providing networking and educational events, \n     continually developing web-based resources, addressing public \n     policy, and analyzing resource and funding issues.\n       We respectfully urge you to support Dr. von Eschenbach's \n     prompt confirmation.

Dr. von Eschenbach will lead the agency and \n     strengthen the credibility of its decision-making process.\n                                                  Edwin A.

Michael Enzi,\n     Chairman, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Ranking Member, Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n         Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Enzi and Ranking Member Kennedy: The ALS \n     Association strongly supports the nomination of Andrew von \n     Eschenbach, M.D., to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug \n     Administration and we urge the Committee to favorably report \n     the nomination to the full Senate.\n       The ALS Association is the only national voluntary health \n     association dedicated solely to the fight against Amyotrophic \n     Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), more commonly known as Lou Gehrig's \n     disease. Our mission is to improve the quality of life for \n     those living with ALS and to discover a treatment and cure \n     for this deadly disease.\n       We believe that strong leadership at the FDA is essential \n     so that the Agency can fulfill its mission and not only \n     ensure that drugs and medical devices are safe and effective, \n     but also that people have timely access to the latest medical \n     technologies. This is especially important for people with \n     ALS, for there is no known cause or cure for ALS, and only \n     one drug available to treat the disease. That drug, approved \n     by the FDA in 1995, provides only modest benefits, prolonging \n     life by just a few months.\n       Dr. von Eschenbach would provide the vital leadership that \n     is needed at the FDA. Moreover, his diverse background as a \n     physician, educator and advocate will be a tremendous asset \n     to the Agency and to the Nation, for he can view the Agency's \n     mission from many different perspectives and help to foster \n     the collaboration that is so important to advancing medical \n     science and quality health care.\n       The ALS Association is pleased to offer our strong support \n     for this nomination and again urge the Committee and the \n     Senate to support Dr. von Eschenbach as the next Commissioner \n     of the Food and Drug Administration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Steve Gibson,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Government Relations and Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Cancer Cure Coalition,\n\n                          Palm Beach Gardens, FL, August 25, 2006.\n     Senator Michael B. Enzi,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor \n         and Pensions, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: The Cancer Cure Coalition is supporting \n     the nomination of Dr. Andrew VonEschenbach as commissioner of \n     the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and we have today \n     issued a press release announcing our support. Attached is a \n     letter from the coalition to Dr. VonEschenbach which gives \n     the reasons for our support.\n       The Cancer Cure Coalition supports\n\n     changes at the FDA which will improve\n\n     its operation. We believe the appointment\n\n     of Dr. VonEschenbach will lead to that\n\n     result. If it would help your committee in\n\n     its decision on Dr. VonEschenbach's appoint-\n\n     ment I would be pleased to appear before\n\n     the committee to testify. My bio appears\n\n     on the Cancer Cure Coalition's website\n\n\n[[Page S11411]]\n\n     www.cancercurecoalition.org and I am attaching a copy of it \n     for you to review.\n       If you need any further information please feel free to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles A. Reinwald,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Those letters are from Omeris, Ohio's bioscience membership \nand development organization; the New York State Cancer Association; \nthe ALS Association; the Cancer Cure Coalition, and there are others. \nThese groups recognize the absolute necessity of having a Senate-\nconfirmed Commissioner of Food and Drugs. I understand some of my \ncolleagues are not satisfied. They seek to use this nomination as \nleverage to accomplish some other agendas. That is something you can do \nin the Senate. However, I urge them to consider the consequences of \nthose actions. In the upcoming year we face an exceptionally full \nagenda with respect to the FDA. We need this man in place. This man \ncould work anywhere in America, probably anywhere in the world, and do \nmuch better than what we are offering.\n  I appreciate his sense of wanting to give back. He is a three-time \ncancer survivor and understands a lot about food and drugs outside of \nbeing a doctor.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in getting cloture so that we can get \nthe confirmation accomplished.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ENZI. It is my understanding that the previous speakers did yield \ntheir time back. So all time is yielded back.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, under the \nprevious order, pursuant to rule XXII, the clerk will report the motion \nto invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Executive \n     Calendar No. 907, the nomination of Andrew von Eschenbach, of \n     Texas, to be Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Department of \n     Health and Human Services.\n         William H.

On this vote, the yeas are 89, the nays are 6. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Chamber for allowing us to do \nthe cloture vote. With the strong support shown by the cloture vote, I \nwould highly recommend that we get this man confirmed so he can \nactually have the opportunity to do the kinds of things that have been \nexpected of him in the debate we have had. I also thank Senator Kennedy \nfor his tremendous help. We have had a number of meetings, a number of \nhearings. This is the second confirmation of an FDA Director we have \nworked on. It will be nice to have somebody actually in the position, \nbut I do thank Senator Kennedy and all of his staff.\n  I do want to mention the staff person who has directed my health \nissues. Stephen Northrup is on the floor, and I thank him particularly \nfor all of the work on all of the health issues we have had. Anybody \nwho has looked at the list of those we have done will find it has been \na very productive session in the health area, and we are still working \non another half dozen issues that could pass yet in this session before \nthe week ends. So I thank Stephen for all of his tremendous help. I ask \nthat people support the nomination of Dr. Von Eschenbach.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I spoke earlier this morning against \ncloture. Cloture passed, which for the public listening means there are \n60 percent or more in support of stopping debate, and there is under \nthe rules the possibility of 30 hours of debate. I don't intend to \nprobably speak for more than a half hour, so if anybody is interested \nin how long postcloture debate might go on, it won't go on very long \nfrom my point of view. But I do want to take some time to tell people, \neven though it is quite obvious this nominee will be approved, why I \nthink he should not be approved.\n  I placed a hold on this nominee for quite a few weeks. That hold \nobviously was ignored by the leader when he filed cloture, which is his \nright to do. I voted against cloture because I take my constitutional \nduty to conduct oversight of the executive branch of Government very \nseriously, and I think the nominee is standing in the way of Congress \ndoing its oversight of the agency of which he is now Acting Director \nand will probably soon be the confirmed Director. That sort of lack of \ncooperation violates the separation of powers and the checks and \nbalances within our constitutional system.\n  I hope my colleagues know that I take a great deal of time to make \nsure that we do both jobs we have the responsibility to do here in the \nCongress. One is to pass laws. But the one we are never taught much \nabout in political science classes is the constitutional job of \noversight, which is the responsibility to make sure the laws are \nfaithfully executed and money is being spent according to congressional \nintent, and the overseeing of the administrative branch of Government. \nSo I take a great deal of my time in the Senate trying to make \nGovernment work not just by passing laws but by making sure they are \nfaithfully executed. I don't do that all by myself as a single Senator. \nI have good staff. I charge my staff to conduct oversight rigorously \nand to investigate any areas where the Federal Government is failing to \nbe transparent, accountable, and effective. Transparency is so \nimportant, because the public's business, which is everything about the \nFederal Government, ought to be public. If the work of the executive \nbranch fails the\n\n[[Page S11412]]\n\nsniff test and the law is not being faithfully executed or the public's \nbusiness is not being made public, that is when it is my constitutional \nresponsibility to blow the whistle.\n  Quite frankly, I don't want to take credit for what I am able to blow \nthe whistle on, because there are a lot of good, patriotic employees in \nthe executive branch of Government who also know it is their \nconstitutional responsibility to execute the laws and spend the money \nright. When they see it isn't happening, and particularly when they go \nup the chain of command and don't get results, or when taxpayers monies \nare being wasted and it seems nobody cares, then they exercise the \nright they have under laws to blow the whistle to Members of Congress.\n  So we obviously count on whistleblowers--in other words, patriotic \nFederal employees--who report something wrong when people above them \ndon't care. They care enough to come to us and give us a lot of good \ninformation. So today I am blowing the whistle on this nominee. In good \nconscience, I did put a hold on the nominee, and I will not vote in \nfavor of him for the reasons I have given before and reasons that will \nbe more spelled out now. A vote for this nominee would be an \nendorsement of the stonewalling, but, more importantly, the disrespect \nfor Congress he has shown by not cooperating with congressional \noversight. I can say this not only because of his actions but because \nof his words which are on the record.\n  In response to a nomination question in which I asked this nominee if \nhe would cooperate with congressional oversight, Dr. Von Eschenbach \nidentified a number of ``executive branch interests'' as a basis for \nnot complying with congressional requests, including ``matters pending \nbefore the agency.'' And ``predecisional deliberative process \ninformation,'' and ``open investigation information.'' You get this \nsort of gobbledegook as excuses for not giving information to Congress \nas they promised to do but, outside of that, that the Constitution \nrequires they do; that is if you believe in the checks and balances of \nour Government and if you believe it is backed up by Supreme Court \ndecisions. It seems to me it has a good basis.\n  This nominee was not well-served by whoever counseled him on these \nmatters. He should know that during my years in the Senate, my \ninvestigators have obtained access to every single one of these \ncategories of so-called confidential information. I would say to the \ndistinguished chairman of the HELP Committee who is watching over this \nnomination process--confirmation process--he said to me before the vote \non cloture it would help if we got Dr. Von Eschenbach approved because \nnow he is an acting and maybe he can't do all the things that he can do \nas Director, and that may be true. But not once in my discussions or my \nstaffs' discussions with people at FDA was there ever a hint from the \nnominee himself that once approved, he would be able to give us all of \nthese documents. I use this chart as an example: You get an answer to a \nrequest and you get 57 pages removed. Another chart I had up here \nshowed 43 pages were removed. And what is in those pages? Who knows \nwhat is in them. We don't even know why they were removed, and we don't \nknow who made the decision to remove them.\n\n  That is cooperation with Congress? Not once, I say to Senator Enzi, \ndid he ever tell me or my staff or people who are working for him that \nif we could get this confirmation over, we will be able to satisfy what \nyou want done. So I don't see anything better, with a vote of approval \nby the Senate, of cooperation with us than before.\n  But he wasn't well-served by those who counseled him. He should know \nthat during my years in the Senate, my investigators have obtained \naccess to every single one of these categories of so-called \nconfidential information. His answer is at odds with my belief that \ncongressional oversight is one of the best ways to shake things up at a \ngovernment agency and expose the truth. The truth will make Government \nlook better, or if the truth doesn't make Government look better, at \nleast you are being candid with the American people. Besides, it is the \npublic's business, and whether it is good news or bad news, it ought to \nbe public.\n  Dr. Von Eschenbach's answers happen to be at odds with my belief that \ncongressional oversight is one of the best ways to get to the bottom of \nthings. This is true not just of the FDA; it is true of any Government \nagency. If an agency is not doing the right thing, typically behind it \nthere is an effort to keep information suppressed, an effort to keep \npeople from doing what they think ought to be done, an effort to keep \npeople from doing what their job requires them to do, or to not let \nthem put out that information. The muzzling of dissent and information \nis too common throughout our Government. Things that should be \ntransparent in Government simply are not. And under Dr. Von Eschenbach, \nthe FDA has not only avoided transparency, it also has threatened those \nwho are trying to desperately expose the truth.\n\n  That is not just under Dr. Von Eschenbach. For years before him, \nthere has been intense pressure brought to bear upon scientists who \nwant to do the scientific process. I say ``do the scientific process'' \nbecause the scientific process answers itself or gives the answer. That \nis what we want: answers on safety and efficacy of drugs.\n  There is a culture there--even prior to Dr. Von Eschenbach, for any \nserious Director who wants to change it--that is going to make it very \ndifficult to change because you have an agency that is more interested \nin its public relations and how they look to the public-at-large than \nwhat their job is. That is when they end up getting egg on their face, \nwhen they are more concerned about their public relations than just \ndoing the job. In most instances, if these agencies do what they are \nsupposed to do, things get done and get done effectively, and then the \npublic relations takes care of itself. Good policy, good administering \nof law, is good public relations. It will take care of itself.\n  I met with this nominee after the White House sent his nomination to \nthe Senate last March. I hoped he would provide the kind of strong, \npermanent leadership this agency needs to change its culture, where \nscientists are intimidated from doing their work. Over the next 9 \nmonths, this nominee showed me that he is unlikely to provide that kind \nof leadership. My belief is what you see is what you get. I fear what \nwe will get from this nominee is what we got from him where he is now \nas the Acting Commissioner. Let me tell you why, with just a few \nexamples.\n  First, the doctor failed to live up to his word. In our meeting, he \nsaid he respected and understood the important role Congress plays as \nan equal branch of Government. But it didn't take long after that \nmeeting before the first red flags appeared.\n  In April, the committee began its investigation of the Food and Drug \nAdministrations's approval and postmarket surveillance of the Ketek \ndrug, an antibiotic that came under renewed scrutiny last January. It \nlooks as though it is another drug where the FDA was caught flatfooted. \nThe Finance Committee issued two subpoenas in May after the FDA refused \nto provide documents related to Ketek. I referred to a family in Cedar \nRapids, IA, who lost an 18-year-old son.\n  During this time, the Food and Drug Administration also refused \naccess to Food and Drug Administration officials. The Finance Committee \nwas forced to issue a subpoena to a special agent in the FDA's Office \nof Criminal Investigation. The FDA refused to allow my staff to speak \nto this Federal employee, citing a policy against providing access to \nline agents. Yet, only months before, just a few weeks before that, my \nstaff interviewed two line agents from the Food and Drug Administration \non another case. What rule was in place when I interviewed them, but a \nfew weeks later you couldn't interview another? Apparently, the policy \nwas abruptly changed. I have seen it change over the years with other \ninvestigations. This policy is not law, and it is typically enforced \nwhen the stakes are at their highest and there is something to hide.\n  I took this matter seriously enough that I went to the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to meet with this agent. I was told that if \nthis agent wanted to speak to me, he would have to assert his status as \na whistleblower under Federal law. I ask today\n\n[[Page S11413]]\n\nwhat I asked that day: Why does this Government employee have to become \na whistleblower to talk to me or anybody else in Congress if the \npublic's business is really public?\n  So I have to ask my colleagues, is that acceptable? When you are \ndoing your constitutional responsibility of oversight, is it acceptable \nto the rest of you in the Senate that they thumb their noses?\n  Also, this Government employee's supervisors put him in a no-win \nsituation, and because of that he risked being in contempt of Congress. \nThis is an agent who put a doctor in jail for fraud in the Ketek study.\n  You understand, I said this started back in January with Ketek and \nour getting involved in the oversight. There was fraud in this Ketek \nstudy. Did the agent do the right thing? It is a closed case. We want \nto talk to him about the closed case, and the Food and Drug \nAdministration says no. So I have to ask, what does the FDA have to \nhide or cover up?\n  There are enough instances of political leaders and public servants \nbeing ruined by coverup. Can't lessons be learned, that when, in this \ntown, two people know something about it, it is no longer a secret?\n  Under this Acting Commissioner, the Food and Drug Administration has \nalso attempted to hide and cover up documents. The Finance Committee \nhas received hundreds of pages that say, as I indicate here, ``57 pages \nremoved.'' There is another poster behind it that looks exactly the \nsame: ``43 pages removed.'' Other documents have whole pages, \nparagraphs, or sentences redacted, with no explanation as to why. \nSometimes documents are marked ``redacted.'' Other times they are not \nmarked, even when it is evident that information is missing. There is \nno explanation for what documents have been withheld or redacted. It is \nincomprehensible, and it looks like the work of the Keystone Cops \nrather than an agency responsible to the American public for the safety \nof drugs and devices and the efficacy of drugs and devices.\n  One of the Food and Drug Administration's most incompetent and absurd \nmoments was when it sent one of my own request letters back to me with \ninformation redacted out of it. Let's get this clear. You folks are \ndefending a person who is running an agency from which I asked for \ninformation and they redacted the letter I sent to them. The letter I \nwrote came back as part of the information. Does that meet the \ncommonsense test? Does that meet the test of competency?\n  Recently, I wrote Secretary Leavitt and Attorney General Gonzales to \nexplain the basis for some of these redactions. I don't know whether \nyou call a blank page a redaction because you don't know what has been \nthere to redact, but obviously there is no information on a blank page \nunless it is about the competency of the people who work within the \nagency.\n  Again, two copies of the same document were redacted differently. \nThink of this. They want to keep us from getting information. They send \nus two copies. One copy has one sentence redacted, and the other copy \ndoesn't redact that sentence but redacts another sentence. So we got \nthe whole document but presumably a basis for things we were not \nsupposed to know but now we know. Do you think this guy with a medical \ndegree, with this sort of background, is going to go in and change that \nculture even if there was nothing wrong with him? Even if he cooperated \nwith me? So it calls into question the good-faith basis for redaction \nat all.\n\n  I could go on and on with examples showing the stonewalling and the \nwithholding of information from legitimate congressional requests, \npursuing our constitutional responsibility of oversight. What it boils \ndown to is that this nominee has demonstrated he does not understand \nthat Government truly is the people's business. He doesn't seem to \nunderstand that the people who finance it, the taxpayers, have a right \nto know what their Government is doing and how their money is being \nspent.\n  I will give one final example. I have been a longtime champion of \nwhistleblowers. I was the lead Senate sponsor of the 1986 whistleblower \namendments to the False Claims Act. Back then, we were interested in \ndismantling a too-cozy relationship between defense contractors and the \nPentagon. Today, whistleblowers are once again the key to dismantling \nthe cozy relationship between some drug companies and the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n  In June, Dr. Von Eschenbach held a meeting of FDA staff involving \nthis drug I have been investigating, questioning how it was handled--\nKetek. FDA employees who were present say that he used a lot of sports \nmetaphors regarding being a ``team player'' and keeping opinions \n``inside the locker room.'' Basically, he said to not criticize the FDA \noutside the locker room, ``outside the locker room'' being his words. \nApparently he stated that anyone who spoke outside the locker room \nmight find themselves ``off the team.''\n  How are you going to do your job of congressional oversight if you \nhave somebody you are getting confirmed who says that if you want to \ntalk to anybody, they better not talk to you, at least not talk off \nnote, because they are no longer on the team? Just think of the \nintimidation that brings throughout the Federal bureaucracy.\n  This nominee held this meeting in the midst of this ongoing \ncongressional investigation of this drug Ketek. He called the meeting \nafter a number of critical reports in the media about the FDA's \nhandling of Ketek. A number of FDA employees interviewed by the \ncommittee were offended by his comments, found them highly \nquestionable, inappropriate, and potentially threatening. I don't think \nthere was any ``potential'' about it, they were meant to be \nthreatening, and I agree with the employees.\n  Leaders of an agency should not hold a meeting to suggest that \ndissenters will be kicked off the team, particularly when the lives of \nAmerican people are at stake, when drugs are going to be put on the \nline and they might not be safe. I can refer to the death of an 18-\nyear-old in Cedar Rapids, IA. His is the type of action that shows the \ntrue stripes of the nominee. He broke his word that he respected \nwhistleblowers--that is what he told me; quite obviously he doesn't \nrespect whistleblowers--and that he would never raise even the \nappearances of retaliation. If this meeting isn't an example of \nretaliation, I don't know what it is. When it comes to health care and \npublic safety, we need to empower whistleblowers more than ever. They \ndemonstrate extraordinary courage in the face of extraordinary \nadversity. It is extremely difficult to be a whistleblower. As I like \nto say, they are about as welcome as a skunk at a picnic. Yet it is \nwhistleblowers in Government who put their job security on the line to \ncome forward and expose fraud or wrongdoing for the public good. My \nFinance Committee staff has been investigating serious allegations \nraised by whistleblowers at the FDA on various issues over a period of \n3 years. Many of these allegations are very serious and call into \nquestion whether the Food and Drug Administration is fulfilling its \nmission to protect the health and safety of Americans. The way the Food \nand Drug Administration under this nominee has handled the \ninvestigation of Ketek shows the agency would like to keep its business \nsecret. It doesn't want these issues made public or subjected to \nscrutiny. The culture at the FDA has been we will let the public know \nwhat we think they need to know.\n\n  The American people do not want the government making decisions about \nwhat is good for them behind closed doors.\n  The goal of the Finance Committee's oversight has been \nstraightforward. As chairman, I wanted to bring out in the open the \ndecisions made by the FDA. For too long the agency has been making its \ndecisions behind closed doors.\n  This nominee is not likely to serve well because he just does not \nseem to get it. He has placed media relations over the mission of the \nFDA. First and foremost, he is supposed to do the right thing on behalf \nof Americans. Dr. Von Eschenbach has other interests to serve and they \nare not always the interests of John Q. Public.\n  I hear from time to time from other agencies that particular \ndocuments are especially sensitive or that the release of certain \ndocuments could jeopardize a criminal investigation--I understand that. \nBut in those circumstances, I have reached accommodations. \nUnfortunately, in this case, my efforts to work with Dr. Von Eschenbach \nand his subordinates have been all but summarily dismissed.\n  As I am sure you know, I intend to keep pressing the FDA for greater\n\n[[Page S11414]]\n\ntransparency and openness. I think there is going to be new leadership \nin the Congress which is going to be even more aggressive and has a \nhistory of being more aggressive in this area. I have been welcoming \nand I continue to welcome that sort of help.\n  As I continue with my constitutional duties to conduct oversight, I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to ensure transparency, \naccountability, and effective governance by the executive branch. The \nbottom line is Congress needs to stay committed to oversight of the \nexecutive branch. The public depends on Congress to fulfill its duty \nand hold executive agency leadership accountable. To sum up, that is \nwhat congressional oversight is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                       Tribute to Kenneth Jordan\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service and \nsacrifice of Colorado Springs police officer Kenneth Jordan.\n  My wife Joan and I were deeply saddened to hear of the senseless \ndeath of Officer Kenneth Jordan while in the line of duty this past \nTuesday in Colorado Springs, CO, during a traffic stop.\n  It takes a person of great courage to become an officer of the law. \nIt takes a strong, hardworking, and considerate individual. It takes a \nspecial someone who is willing to pay the ultimate price in protecting \nthe safety of others.\n  Officer Kenneth Jordan was just this person. Unfortunately, Officer \nKenneth Jordan paid the ultimate price.\n  Officer Kenneth Jordan was the 12th Colorado Springs police officer \nto be killed in the line of duty. According to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial Fund, more than 17,500 officers have been \nkilled nationwide since 1792, including 231 in Colorado.\n  The shock to the city of Colorado Springs this week at his death is \nespecially harsh--Kenneth Jordan was the second Colorado Springs \nofficer to be killed this year. Officer Jared Jensen made the ultimate \nsacrifice last February. The memorial service for officer Kenneth \nJordan held at 1 p.m. Monday at New Life Church will be a grim repeat \nof the day 10 months ago when Officer Jensen was laid to rest. Before \nOfficer Jensen Colorado Springs police had not held a funeral for one \nof their own in 24 years.\n  A Chicago native at 32 years of age, Kenneth Jordan joined the \nColorado Springs Police Department in January 2000 and was known for \nhis unwavering professionalism and strong work ethic. In February 2004, \nOfficer Kenneth Jordan became a DUI officer, whose passion was getting \ndrunk drivers off the road. According to his colleagues, Officer Jordan \nmade 584 DUI arrests since joining this elite team and nearly broke the \nyearly record of 283 when he made 270 arrests in 2005. Officer Jordan \nwas honored in 2004 by the Mothers Against Drunk Drivers for his \ndedication to enforcing DUI laws.\n  Officer Kenneth Jordan was a brother and a son. He is survived by his \nsister, his loving parents and his girlfriend. Kenneth was well liked \nby his peers and others with whom he came in contact. He was always \nwilling to lend a hand to friend or a stranger alike.\n  The city of Colorado Springs has lost a valuable member of its \ncommunity, and we are all forever grateful for Officer Kenneth Jordan's \nservice and dedication to the safety and well-being of others. His \nservice to the city of Colorado Springs is highly commendable, and his \ncontributions will be remembered.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Officer Kenneth Jordan. \nMay his bravery and unwavering sense of duty serve as a role model for \nthe future generation of law officers. Thank you for your service, \nOfficer Jordan. Rest in peace, Sir.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that myself, the \nSenator from Idaho, and the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein, \nbe allowed to speak as if in morning business for the next 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Labor Shortage\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senator from California, Senator \nFeinstein, will be here in a few moments to join me in what we believe \nis an important message, to continue to speak not only to our \ncolleagues here in the Senate but to America as a whole. It is a speech \nnot unlike the one we gave before we recessed for the break before the \nelection, when it was becoming increasingly obvious that America was \nfinding itself in a major labor shortage, primarily in agriculture and \nsome of the service industries. In fact, while I was home during this \nrecess period of time, the shortage of orange juice in the U.S. market \nmade national news as the price went up substantially.\n  A shortage of orange juice today in the American market is because \nnearly a million cases of oranges rotted on the trees of Florida this \nfall, late summer, because there were not hands to pick them, put them \nin the crates, and move them to the processing sheds. That became \npainfully obvious across America as the harvest season went on, \nespecially in those areas that require concentrated hand labor, whether \nit was Florida, California, and the great San Joaquin Valley of \nCalifornia, whether it was my State of Idaho that began to see labor \nshortages in a variety of areas, whether it was Washington or Oregon, \nwhere many of the fresh fruits and vegetable crops simply did not get \npicked and apples rotted on the trees, whether it was in Kentucky, \nIllinois, Colorado or Michigan, it became so obvious this Congress, in \nits effort to pass comprehensive immigration reform, simply failed to \ndo so. America grew angry about it, grew angry about the number of \nillegals in our country and the fact this Congress did little or \nnothing about it.\n  A great deal is going on. One of the reasons the labor shortages \nbegan to appear is because this Congress insisted, and the \nadministration agreed, we put money behind the securing and the closing \nof our southwest border where literally a million-plus people were \nmoving across annually into our labor market.\n  We viewed that as untenable and irresponsible for a great nation to \nfail to control and secure its borders. We are doing that now. We are \ncontinuing to invest and will continue to invest in a secured border \nenvironment. But in doing that, and failing to couple with a more \nsecure border a comprehensive immigration reform package that allows a \nreal, honest, legal, fair guest worker program, American agriculture \nnow hurts as they have never hurt before.\n  On December 4, all of my colleagues received a letter that in itself \nwas almost unprecedented, a letter from over 400 agricultural groups \naround the country--not just agricultural groups but nursery groups, \nwarehouse groups, storage groups, all of them generally agriculture \nrelated.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 4, 2006.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Craig: The organizations on the attached list \n     urge you to support passage of a comprehensive agricultural \n     worker program this year!\n       You've read the headlines. Food grown for American tables \n     has rotted in American fields this year. The cause? In this \n     case it's not the weather. It's something the Congress can \n     address--labor. We need agricultural worker reform before the \n     end of the 109th Congress.\n       The facts are clear: on many American farms, immigrant \n     labor plants, tends and picks the fruits, vegetables, and \n     other crops. Immigrant workers tend the livestock--feeding \n     the chickens, turkeys, horses, sheep, hogs and cattle and \n     milking the cows. Immigrant workers also produce, install, \n     and maintain the plants that make our homes, towns, and \n     cities livable.\n       The current agricultural temporary worker program--known as \n     H2A is flawed and needs reform. There is no area of the \n     country\n\n[[Page S11415]]\n\n     where H2A workers make up more than 10 percent of the \n     necessary farm workforce. In most areas, it's far less than \n     that. Nationally, only two percent of farm workers are \n     provided by the unresponsive and litigation-plagued H2A \n     program. American agriculture needs a reformed H2A program \n     that is timely, effective and streamlined, and a transition \n     approach that allows for retaining the experienced workforce \n     while capacity is built on the farm and at the border to \n     support wider use of a program like reformed H2A.\n       Language that seeks to address the challenges specific to \n     agriculture was included in the bill passed with a bipartisan \n     majority in the Senate. Many House members of both parties \n     have acknowledged the need to address immigration reform for \n     agriculture. Polls show the American people overwhelmingly \n     favor a common-sense approach to immigration reform including \n     sensible foreign worker programs and earned legal status \n     subject to strict conditions for workers currently in the \n     country.\n       Another fact we must point out, at this late date in the \n     year, is that agriculture issues are rarely partisan issues. \n     While they are sometimes regional, in this case every area of \n     the country is affected by agricultural labor shortages and \n     support for a common-sense solution comes from every region \n     of the country as well.\n       Reports in the media have told the story this harvest \n     season: not enough workers to pick the apples in New York and \n     Washington or the cherries in Oregon and Michigan or the \n     oranges in Florida. One major daily newspaper showed on its \n     front page a massive pile of pears on the ground in \n     California--rejected by the packing house because they were \n     picked too late due to labor shortage. Worker shortages have \n     been reported from coast to coast, from border to border.\n       It is time for the Congress to act. After a decade of \n     debate and with worker shortages now a reality, American \n     agriculture needs your help.\n       The sheer number and geographic representation of the \n     organizations on the attached list show the widespread and \n     urgent need for solving this problem. We urge you to support \n     enactment of a comprehensive agricultural worker program, \n     this year!\n           Sincerely,\n         Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform; Agri-Mark, \n           Inc.;

What did they say? They said it very clearly: a failure to \nreform the H-2A program has put American agriculture in an untenable \nposition. As we bring in the numbers this winter to do the harvest this \nsummer and fall, it is reasonable to predict the loss that the American \nconsumers are now hearing about in bits and pieces through the national \nnews could well be equivalent to $4 billion to $5 billion of actual \nvalue lost at the farm gate--meaning the produce did not leave the \nfarm, it did not make it to the processor, it will never make it to the \nconsumer's shelf, and American consumers will grow increasingly \ndependent upon foreign sources for their food supply. For a great \nnation like ours, that is not only dangerous, it is foolish and \nirresponsible.\n  As we put American agriculture through this difficult time by our \nfailure to enact comprehensive immigration reform, something else is \ngoing on out there on the farm. Diesel costs, fertilizer costs, \nequipment costs are at an all-time high. Of course, we know the general \nenergy costs have increased at an unprecedented rate this year. Not \nonly do we have the impact of high input costs in the production of \nAmerican agriculture and agricultural foodstuffs, now there is nobody \nto pick the crop.\n  I was in the upper San Joaquin Valley late summer meeting with a \ngroup of agricultural people. One farmer said it as clearly as it could \never be said. He said: Senator Craig, if you can't bring the workers to \nme or if you can't make the workers available in the valley, I will \nhave to go where the workers are.\n  What did he mean by that? He meant he was leasing land in Argentina \nor Mexico or Brazil where the labor force is today.\n  What will happen to the land in the great San Joaquin Valley? It will \ngo\n\n[[Page S11417]]\n\nfallow, or it will be put in homes. It will no longer be profitable to \nproduce in that greatest agricultural valley in the world which \nproduces the vegetable crops and all of the other kinds of crops the \nAmerican consumer so readily needs, knows, and wants.\n  Last year, for the first time, by a near majority of months, America \nwas consuming more from foreign import than they were consuming from \ntheir own production. That is something that should never happen in the \ngreatest agricultural Nation in the world.\n  I think Americans get it. There was a very loud group who distorted \nthe whole debate. But they also taught us something important, that \nGovernment had fumbled and Congress had failed in its responsible \napproach to a comprehensive, enforceable, immigration law. We ignored \nit for decades. In ignoring it, great problems had occurred. Not only \ndid we have an unprecedented number of undocumented illegal foreign \nnationals in our country, but we had allowed industries such as \nagriculture to grow increasingly dependent on an illegal workforce.\n  Agriculture came to me in the late 1990s and said: Senator Craig, \nthis problem has to get fixed.\n  We began to work on it then. Last year, the Senate passed a \ncomprehensive bill with AgJOBS, the bill I had worked on with American \nagriculture and the coalition of over 400 agricultural groups. That was \nin the bill. But when the House failed to act and would not act, when \nwe recognized that we had to gain confidence with the American people \nthat we knew what we were doing and we would do it right, we \nincreasingly began to put pressure on the border, to secure it, to make \nit a real border, to recognize that to cross it you had to be legal, \nyou had to have the right papers and credentials. That is going on as \nwe speak.\n  I was one who encouraged our President to maximize the use of our \nNational Guard to help the Border Patrol to focus on those concentrated \nareas where greater movement of illegals coming across our border was \noccuring.\n  It is an issue of security; it is not just people wanting to cross \nthe border to work. Last year, over 200,000 were apprehended who were \nnon-Mexican. They were from all over the world. Many of them, \ntragically enough, were drug traffickers and illegals trying to get \ninto our country for illegal purposes--not just a hard day's work in \nthe hot sun of an agricultural field. Border security is critical.\n  I hope this Congress will do now what it must do, what it has to do \nfor the American economy, for the American agricultural industries, and \nthat is pass a responsible, comprehensive reform of the H-2A program.\n  Yes, we need to deal with the illegals who are currently in the \ncountry, but we also need to create a legal, identifiable flow of \npeople who come to work and then go home. Ninety-plus percent who work \nhere want to do just that: they want to go back from where they came. \nThat is where their families are in large part. That is where the \nAmerican dollar improves their lifestyle, back in their hometowns, \npredominantly in Mexico but in other parts of the world as well.\n  If we fail to pass comprehensive reform this year, American \nagriculture will go through another devastating year in the field, and \nreal management choices will be made, management choices no longer to \nplant and grow in the United States, no longer to put fresh vegetable \ncrops in the field in December to be harvested in February to supply \nour great and abundant markets and the needs of our consumers.\n\n  This is a very real issue today and a very real problem. That is why \non December 4 this coalition sent to this Congress an urgent message, a \nplea. It said: Please listen to us. Support and pass comprehensive \nagricultural worker reform. Give us an H-2A program that works. That is \nwhat we must accomplish because even in all of our debates this is not \ngoing to happen overnight. We won't get to this for several months, and \nwhen we do, it will take time working with the House. Then it will \npass. Then it has to be implemented.\n  So American agriculture will go through another very tough cropping \nseason and billions of dollars will be lost. Wise business men and \nwomen will have to make decisions of whether they continue to farm in \nthis country and produce in this country or if they go elsewhere to \nproduce, and instead of being domestic producers, they become foreign \nimporters. That is something that should never be allowed to happen.\n  My colleague from California has joined me. Senator Feinstein and I \nand others have worked closely to craft the right kind of bill that \nworks, that is legal, that is transparent, that recognizes the \nimportance of border security and border control to get this great \ncountry back into the business of doing what it ought to do; that is, \nto allow into our country those we want and to keep out those we don't \nwant.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. We are proud of that. Most all of us \ncame from somewhere else some time ago. It is because of this we are a \ngreat nation. It is because of the ability to assimilate, to bring into \nour culture foreign nationals to become Americans that has made our \ncountry great.\n  In the last two decades, we failed to do that in a responsible \nfashion. Now, because of that, American agriculture hurts, other \nindustries hurt. It is important we grow increasingly sensitive to \ngetting this job done and getting it right. The job itself is passing \nAgJOBS, the comprehensive responsible bill to help American agriculture \ncreate a legal workforce.\n  Under the unanimous consent the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, has the next 15 or 16 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  May I proceed, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho. I also \nindicate how much I agree with the Senator.\n  Before I proceed, I note that Senator Murray is in the Senate. I ask \nunanimous consent she be given 10 minutes directly following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Senator Craig rightly stated that \nmanagement choices are being made right now. That, in fact, is true. We \nare seeing billions of dollars of an agricultural industry effectively \nbeing destroyed. Some of it is competition from abroad, but much of it \nis the fact that growers and farmers have a 20-percent--it is \nestimated--labor shortage to plant, to harvest, to prune. There is \ntremendous uncertainty, I can tell you for a fact, in the largest State \nin the Union, and the largest agricultural State. Farmers do not \nbelieve they can get workers to harvest their crops, ergo they are not \nplanting these crops.\n  Senator Craig and I came to the Senate before. We have written a \njoint letter to the leader. We have asked, please, because \ncomprehensive immigration reform tends to be stalled, at least pass \nAgJOBS. An industry depends on it.\n  We have worked out AgJOBS. It has passed the Senate as part of the \nimmigration bill. Just take out the part that is AgJOBS and pass it. It \nis a 5-year pilot. It involves the ability of the agricultural industry \nof our country to get labor, both through H-2A reform, which is \ncontained, and through a 5-year pilot to try to secure a workforce for \nagriculture.\n  While I was in California, I had the opportunity to meet with growers \nand farmers. The cry for labor reform has only grown louder. What I \nwill do is talk a little bit about the micro impact and then the macro \nimpact.\n  California olive farmers delivered only about 50,000 tons of olives \nthis year. That is down from 142,000 tons last year. So only one-third \nof the crop could be harvested this year because of a lack of labor. \nFarmers knew their crops were going to be light because of weather \ntroubles. But even with the smaller crop to harvest, farmers had \ntrouble hiring enough workers to work in their groves.\n  In Stanislaus County, a farmer by the name of Kevin Chiesa he is a \ngrower and is the president of the Stanislaus Farm Bureau--reported \nthat they simply pulled their fig and peach trees out of the ground \nbecause they did not have enough workers to harvest the ripe fruit. Mr. \nPresident, 350 acres were pulled on his farm, leading to a net dollar \nloss of $200,000 and a gross loss of $750,000.\n  Now, that may not seem like much to some, but it sure is a lot to a \nfarmer\n\n[[Page S11418]]\n\nwho depends on this money to pay his bank loans and to support his \nfamily and pay his mortgage.\n  In San Bernardino County, Richard Miller of Murai Farms saw his small \nfarm of 130 acres struggle because of a lack of labor. He reported they \nexperienced substantial loss in their strawberry crop, resulting in a \nhalf a million dollars in losses already this year. Mr. Miller has been \nfarming since 1962, but the difficulties he has experienced have \nrecently caused him to think about giving up his farm and leaving the \nprofession for good.\n  Over and over again, I have heard that growers need an immediate fix. \nThey do not know what to plant in the upcoming spring season because \nthey do not know whether they will have the workers necessary to \nharvest the crops.\n  I will say that my friend and colleague, Senator Boxer, and I are in \nsync on this issue. She also has talked to growers and farmers. She \nalso knows the problem. She also has been a strong supporter of the \nAgJOBS program. So in making my remarks today, I want to be certain \nthat this body knows I am also speaking for my friend and colleague, \nSenator Boxer.\n  I have brought to the floor today a graphic illustration of one of \nour pear growers. Her name is Toni Scully. I have met Toni Scully. I \nmet with her in California and she told me about the problems her \nfamily had experienced. Shown in this picture is Toni Scully in her \npear orchard. Her family lost 25 percent of their bumper crop this year \nbecause they did not have sufficient labor to harvest the pears. As \nshown in the picture, here are the pears all over the ground. They are \nall going to be either plowed under or thrown in the garbage. Here is a \nwoman who will have lost essentially everything this year.\n  Now, other growers tell me they are afraid for the future. They are \nafraid to plant crops that will later be left to rot in the fields. So \nsome growers are experimenting with moving their farms to Mexico. Last \nweek, the New York Times ran an article that pointed out how much \nimported produce is now rising above exported produce. And one of the \nbig problems is the produce produced at home is not assured; therefore, \nmore produce is coming in from outside.\n  This is so shortsighted because we are throwing American families \ninto jeopardy. Farming families cannot support themselves if they \ncannot produce their crops.\n  The Grape and Tree League of California--now, this is a big trade \norganization representing what is a huge grape and fruit tree crop \ngroup--they estimate that my State alone--Senator Boxer's and my \nState--has suffered approximately $75 million in tree fruit and grape \nloss alone. That is a loss of $75 million.\n  The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that if this labor \nshortage continues, California agricultural production loss could be as \nhigh as $3 billion each year in the short term and as high as $4.1 \nbillion in the long term. This is decimating. California agricultural \nincome loss is projected to reach $2.8 billion each year in the long \nterm.\n  The problem is not just in California. Dairy farmers in Vermont, \ncitrus growers in Florida, others throughout the country, have \ncomplained about the labor shortage and the uncertainty it creates for \nthe future.\n  The Farm Credit Associations of New York estimate that if the labor \nshortage continues there, New York State will lose $195 million in \nvalue of agricultural production and over 200,000 acres in production \nover the next 24 months.\n  The American Farm Bureau Federation estimates that if agriculture \nloses its migrant labor force, the national production loss in fruits \nand vegetables will be between $5 billion and $9 billion a year. This \nis not my estimate. This is the American Farm Bureau's estimate. They \nalso say that over the long term, the annual production loss would \nincrease to $6.5 billion to $12 billion each year.\n  These losses are not just limited to growers. The impact is felt \nthroughout the economy. For every job lost on family farms and ranches, \nthe country loses three to four jobs in related sectors equipment, \ninputs, packaging, processing, transportation, marketing, lending, \ninsurance--they are all supported by having agricultural production \nhere in this country.\n  Low-producing farms mean a lowered local tax base as farms no longer \ngenerate income and create jobs.\n  Ultimately, the current farm labor situation is making Americans more \ndependent on foreign food. Instead of stocking produce grown and \nharvested in our country, America's grocers are increasingly filling \ntheir shelves with foreign-grown produce.\n\n  For decades, the fiercely independent fruit and vegetable growers of \nCalifornia, Florida, and other States, traditionally have shunned \nFederal subsidies. Now, they are now buckling under the pressure and \nasking us for Federal subsidies.\n  In just one example, because of labor shortages, U.S. avocado farmers \nmay miss the January market window and lose out to Mexican avocado \nfarmers who will be allowed to import into California in 2007. This \nwill wipe out our local avocado crop. The fact that they cannot get the \nlabor they need to harvest the fruits and vegetables only weakens our \nwhole American agricultural industry.\n  Now, the reason for the shortage is simple. There is no readily \navailable pool of excess labor to replace the 500,000 foreign migrant \nworkers we have depended on for years. The work is hard. It is stooped. \nIt is manual. The hours are long. To make a living, the laborer must \ntravel around the region, from site to site, working for more than one \nemployer, to coincide with the crop harvesting calendar. The problem \nis, we do not have enough American workers who are willing to do this \njob.\n  This week, Senator Craig and I received a letter signed by over 375 \nagricultural organizations and industry leaders from all over the \ncountry urging agricultural reform this year. As they point out, this \nis not a partisan issue. Every area of the country is affected.\n  In November, I received a letter signed by 147 growers' organizations \nand individual farmers. They point out in their letter that they cannot \nwait another year, that our State's pear growers had an exceptional \ncrop, the best-looking crop in over 40 years, yet they suffered major \nlosses. They point out:\n\n       While the pear losses were the most dramatic among the \n     commodities, other producers suffered as well from delayed \n     harvests, degraded quality and deferred cultural practices.\n\n  These crises are a big deal. Farm worker crews in my State during \nharvest were 60 percent of normal--60 percent of normal. What they say \nis:\n\n       Pending regulatory changes issued by the Department of \n     Homeland Security propose to turn Social Security \n     Administration's mismatch letters into immigration compliance \n     documents. The proposal would allow DHS to prosecute and \n     penalize employers across this country who do not terminate \n     employees who cannot verify their status.\n\n  So, Mr. President, you see the problem. The farmers are going to be \nprosecuted if they hire someone who is not legal to harvest their \ncrops. And they cannot find legal people to harvest their crops. That \nis the dilemma.\n  Further quoting the letter:\n\n       Even though today's employers follow current SSA \n     requirements regarding mismatch letters, they would be in \n     violation of the Department of Homeland Security proposal. If \n     finalized, the DHS proposal will aggravate the current labor \n     shortage problem in agriculture.\n\n  Bottom line, we cannot continue the way we are going. That is why \nSenator Craig and I have come to the floor. He has worked on this bill \nfor 7 years. I finally got involved and we made some agreed-upon \nchanges. I was able to introduce it in the Judiciary Committee as part \nof the immigration bill with these changes. We were able to address H-\n2A reform--and I will go into that in a minute--and it passed the \nSenate. And, as I say, we believe we have in fact 60 votes in this \nHouse.\n  The letter I spoke about and quoted from is signed by the Allied \nGrape Growers; California Association of Nurseries & Garden Centers; \nCalifornia Association of Wheat Growers; California Association of \nWinegrape Growers; California Bean Shippers Association; California \nCitrus Mutual; California Cotton Ginners & Growers Associations; \nCalifornia Egg Industry Association; California Farm Bureau Federation; \nCalifornia Fig Advisory Board; California Floral Council; California \nGrape and Tree Fruit; California Grain\n\n[[Page S11419]]\n\nand Feed Association; California League of Food Processors; California \nPear Growers Association; California Seed Association; California State \nFloral Association; California Warehouse Association; Far West \nEquipment Dealers Association; almost every county farm bureau; Nisei \nFarmers League; Olive Grower Council of California; and on and on and \non, with different farms, grape growers, olive growers, cotton ginners, \npoultry farmers--pages and pages of people pleading with us to do \nsomething. And we do nothing.\n  We will not repass a bill that has been passed by this Senate once, \nand we are in the middle of a major crisis. So I am kind of at my wit's \nend.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the AgJOBS bill. It is a 5-year \npilot. It would provide a one-time opportunity for trained and \nexperienced agricultural workers to earn the right to apply for legal \nstatus. It would reform the H-2A visa process so that if new workers \nare needed, farmers and growers have a legal path to bring workers to \nharvest their crop. Workers can apply for a blue card if they can \ndemonstrate with records that they have worked in American agriculture \nfor at least 150 days within the previous 2 years.\n  I can see my time is running out. May I have a couple minutes more to \nsum up?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom California be allowed to proceed for at least 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  The blue card would require that they work in American agriculture \nfor an additional 150 workdays per year for 3 years, or 100 workdays \nper year for 5 years. At the end of that time, they would be able to \nobtain a green card. Over the 5 years, it would apply to 1.5 million \nindividuals, which would provide a stable, ongoing workforce for the \nUnited States. Workers would be required to pay a fine of $500, show \nthat they are current on their taxes, that they have not been convicted \nof a crime that involves bodily injury or harm to property in excess of \n$500. Employment would be verified. The program would be capped and \nsunset.\n  The Department of Homeland Security would ensure that the ID cards \nare encrypted, that they have biometric identifiers, that they contain \nanticounterfeiting protections. So you would be able to identify 1.5 \nmillion people who are currently illegal. You would know who they are. \nYou would know they are now legal. You would know they were working in \nagriculture, which desperately needs them.\n  We would also streamline the current agricultural guest worker \nprogram, the H-2A program, which is now unwieldy and ineffective. The \nbill would shorten the labor certification process, which now takes 60 \ndays or more, reducing the approval process to 48 to 72 hours.\n  There are a number of specifics. It freezes the adverse wage rate for \n3 years, to be gradually replaced with a prevailing wage standard. The \nH-2A visas would be secure and counterfeit resistant. In this way, \nagricultural labor would have a permanent workforce and you would have \na secure guest worker program, H-2A, where necessary, to go in to areas \nfor short periods of time. It is a win/win situation. It has passed \nthis Senate.\n  The losses are in the hundreds of millions of dollars across the \nNation, and we do nothing. We stiff the American agricultural industry. \nI have a hard time understanding that. I know the votes are here to do \nit. We could probably do it. Through the Chair, I ask Senator Craig, \ndoes he not believe we could pass this bill with maybe an hour on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for asking the question. This is not \nan unknown issue. We all understand it. The Congress understands it. \nThe election is over. People can decide whether they survived or failed \nbecause of their position one way or another on immigration. The \nreality of what she and I talk about is so real today. We knew it then; \nwe know it now. We have the 60 votes. We have had them for some time. \nThere is no question in my mind, with the reforms we are talking about, \nthis could become law and we could pass it in the Senate.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may, the letter we wrote to Leader Frist asking \nthat it be calendared, has the Senator received a response? Because I \nhave not.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I have not either. Obviously, we are in the closing hours \nof the 109th Congress. Whether we could get it done now, but more \nimportantly, get it done when we get back very early in the year, is \ngoing to be critical to us.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is the point. We did not just write this letter. \nPerhaps the frustration is showing today. It would be my hope we could \nget this calendared sometime in January and get it passed so that the \nspring plant can happen all throughout this Nation. Otherwise, I can \nonly tell you, in my State, farmers who can are going to go to Mexico. \nFarmers who can are going to plant in Mexico. Is this what we want to \nhave happen? I don't think so.\n  I thank Senator Craig for his longstanding work on this issue and for \nhis leadership. When one comes to the floor of the Senate, sometimes \none thinks nobody is listening. I hope somebody is listening. I hope \npeople recognize that we have a huge industry out there. It needs \nattention. It needs a workforce. Americans will not do this work. \nTherefore, it is a migrant workforce that does the work. There is a \nmethodology to legalize it, to limit it, to sunset it, and to fix what \nhas been a broken H-2A program and in a bill that has already passed \nthe Senate once already during the 109th Congress.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleague from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that following my remarks, the \nSenator from Maryland be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           A TERRIBLE LEGACY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am here because families across this \ncountry are going to be hurt because this Republican Congress has not \ndone its job. We have all heard that this session of Congress is a do-\nnothing Congress. It has earned that title. But there is one thing \neverybody ought to understand. When Congress doesn't do its job, it \nmakes it harder for all Americans to do their jobs, whether it is \nteaching our children or providing health care or improving \ntransportation or making our communities safer.\n  This may seem like a debate over process, but it affects you. If you \nfly on an airplane and are concerned about your safety, it affects you. \nIf you drive on a highway and are concerned about traffic congestion, \nthis affects you. If you want our Government to stop the flow of money \nto terrorist organizations, this affects you.\n  Today I want to share with the Senate a few examples of how it is \ngoing to hurt because the Senate Republican leadership has not done its \njob. I want to point out how it is going to hurt the priorities in my \nState of Washington, from their fight against drugs and gangs to the \ncleanup of the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. This Republican Congress's \nfailure is going to make it harder for all of us to do our jobs next \nyear, and that is a terrible legacy for the Republican leadership to \nleave our country.\n  Every year Congress has to pass its annual spending bills. They fund \nour Government. We work very hard on those bills. We craft them so they \nmeet the needs that our constituents tell us about, on everything from \nhealth care to transportation to education. Sometimes it takes a while \nto finish those bills, but we get them done. Then the country is able \nto move forward. This year it has been very different. We did our work \non the Appropriations Committee, but then the Senate Republican \nleadership blocked our progress. I serve on that Appropriations \nCommittee. We did our job on time in a bipartisan manner back in July, \nunder the leadership of Senators Cochran and Byrd. We completed work on \n11 appropriations bills and sent them to the Senate floor.\n\n  Here is what is impressive. Every single Senator on the committee \nvoted to report each and every bill. But since then, the Senate \nRepublican leadership blocked our progress. They decided to only let 3 \nof those 11 bills move forward. Those bills cover extremely important \nfunctions--defense, homeland security, and military construction--but \nthey are just 3 of the 11 bills. What about the needs of our \ncommunities? What about the needs of our schools\n\n[[Page S11420]]\n\nand colleges and universities? What about the support of health \nresearch or investing in infrastructure or meeting the needs of our \nfarmers or ranchers or law enforcement? Those are critical needs. The \nSenate Republican leadership decided this past summer that they could \ngo on the back burner.\n  Never in my 14 years in the Senate have we started a new fiscal year \nwith so little progress in the Senate in passing the appropriations \nbills and funding the critical functions of Government. Nine weeks ago \nwe entered a new fiscal year. I came to the floor at the time to \ncomplain about the unfinished business of the Senate and expressed my \ndisappointment that we were recessing for the elections without moving \nthese bills. I always thought we would come back and the Republican \nleadership would finish its work this session. But they have made a \ndifferent choice. It is now December 7. We have not seen one additional \nfunding bill clear the Senate. And we are now hearing talk that the \nRepublican leadership may formally adjourn the Senate by the end of \nthis week, with most of the 11 appropriations bills never being sent to \nthe President.\n  I think it is worth remembering that when this happened last time, \nthere was a major shift of power back in November of 2002. I was \nserving at the time as chair of the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee. After the election, just as now, the appropriations \nprocess was not complete. But Democrats still worked to fulfill our \nresponsibility by moving bills on the floor and sending them to \nconference. Unfortunately, we were blocked from completing our job. The \nRepublican leadership that was due to come into the majority in January \nof 2003 prohibited us from moving those bills forward. They decided \nthey wanted to complete the appropriations process when they were in \ncontrol.\n  This year Democrats are taking a different approach. We should \ncomplete the appropriations process now, because it is important to \nAmerica's families and communities. We are already 2 months into this \nfiscal year. The American people are paying a price for these delays. \nDemocrats are willing to complete this process now, even under \nRepublican control, because we believe the American people have waited \nlong enough. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership didn't get the \nmessage. Now American families are going to pay the price of this \nnegligence.\n  Some Senators have been suggesting that we simply pass a continuing \nresolution for the next entire fiscal year and everything will be fine, \nclaiming there is no real difference between passing these bills we \nhave worked so hard to put together and putting Government on auto \npilot for a full year. There is a big difference. This country will pay \na price under that scenario for airline safety.\n  Under a full year's CR, my colleagues should know we will only be \nable to hire half of the air traffic controllers we need, and we will \nnot be able to hire the air traffic safety inspectors who are \ndesperately needed. We are going to pay a price in highway safety \nbecause we are not going to be able to reverse the recent increase in \ntraffic fatalities. We are going to pay a price in the fight against \nterrorism, because we are not going to be able to fund the Treasury \nDepartment's efforts to stop terrorist financing. And we are going to \npay a price in educating our kids and improving our communities and \ntraining our workforce. Everywhere you look, we will pay a price if we \nfail to do our job.\n  The Republican mismanagement will hurt my State of Washington, from \nthe fight against drugs and gangs to the cleanup effort at the Hanford \nNuclear Reservation. If you sit down with law enforcement officers in \nmy home State, as I have, they will tell you they are facing a \nmethamphetamine epidemic. It is destroying families and communities, \nand law enforcement needs help to deal with it. Over the past few years \nI have worked to provide funding each year for the Washington State \nmeth initiative. It is a coordinated Statewide effort that focuses on \ncleanup, treatment, prevention, and law enforcement, and it is a great \nmodel for other States. Again, this year in the Senate bill, I got a \ncommitment to support my State's meth initiative. But now this funding \nis going to be delayed and put in jeopardy because Senate Republicans \nhave refused to do their job and pass the Commerce-Justice-State \nspending bill. Because Republican Senators are not going to do their \njob, they are going to make it harder for police in my State to do \ntheir job, and that is wrong.\n  This failure to act will also delay and put at risk support for an \nantigang program in Yakima Valley. Back on October 16, I was in Yakima \nat the police department for a meeting with two dozen local officials, \nlaw enforcement, and prosecutors. They told me about the tremendous \nchallenges they were facing, and the top issues on their list were meth \nand gangs. I heard their message, and I have fought for a commitment in \nthe Senate to support a community-based gang task force. That funding \nis needed immediately. Now I have to go back to Yakima and tell those \nhard-working leaders that the funding I got was delayed and put at risk \nbecause Republicans don't want to do their jobs and pass the annual \nspending bills. People in my State deserve better than that.\n  Let me offer another example of how the Republicans' failure to do \ntheir jobs is hurting my State. Our Government has an obligation to \nclean up the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Richland, WA. As I speak, \nthat community is working hard to clean up nuclear waste, protect the \ncommunity, and the environment. Here in the Senate I have fought for \nthe funding we need to keep that cleanup moving forward. But now the \nRepublicans are refusing to move the Energy and water bill. As a \nresult, funding for Hanford cleanup is going to be delayed. That means \nit is going to take longer, and it will cost more money. The Republican \nleadership is going to have to explain to the people I represent in the \nTri-Cities and throughout my State why Hanford funding is being \ndelayed. They are going to have to answer for their failure to act on \nthese and other priorities.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. Rather than spending the month of \nJuly and September debating unrelated bills for political reasons, we \ncould have been debating these appropriations bills that are critically \nneeded for our Nation's safety and security.\n  We could have been fighting for the people we represent. We could \nhave been meeting their basic needs and protecting their livelihoods \nand ensuring their safety. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership \nsaid ``no,'' and now our families are going to pay a price.\n  I think this Senate deserves better, but more important, the people \nwe represent deserve a lot better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to compliment the Senator from \nWashington State for commenting on the law enforcement aspects that are \ngoing to be lost under the way we are proceeding because she is \nabsolutely right. I say to the Senator before she leaves the floor, \nthat is in the Commerce, Justice, Science Committee, on which I am \ncurrently ranking member. We worked on a bipartisan basis--Senator \nShelby and I--to produce the bill that would have given the financial \ntools to local enforcement to fight the meth epidemic, the gangs that \nare coming, all with the most grim and ghoulish approaches in our local \ncommunities.\n  But we are saying, you know what, we are cutting and running. So we \nare cutting their budget, and we are running out of here. That phrase \n``cut and run'' has been used so cavalierly, but I am telling you that \nis exactly what we are doing now. We are cutting and running from our \nresponsibility to fund the programs that meet compelling human needs in \nour own States, in our own country, as well as those things that help \nwith the national security, such as funding the FBI and to the security \nin our own communities. We are talking about meth and gangs, but I know \nthe Senator feels as strongly as I do about sexual predators. We worked \nwith Mr. Gonzales, the Attorney General, in terms of a very good \nantisexual predator approach, with listing and watch lists and those \nthings that, again, empower the local law enforcement. We have a \nprogram that helps sheriffs.\n  So if we want to bring in the posse, we have to bring in the bucks. \nWhat I like about the sheriff initiative is it is in every community, \nnot only urban\n\n[[Page S11421]]\n\nareas but also out in the rural areas. But, oh, no, we have to get \nhome. Well, I think we have abdicated our responsibility. I thank the \nSenator for what she has said.\n  Mr. President, we are abdicating our responsibility, and in \nabdicating our responsibility to pass the outstanding appropriations \nbills, we are having a very dire impact on our own country. Of the 12 \nappropriations bills, only 2 have passed. One is Defense and one is \nHomeland Security. I am so glad that we did pass those and we did them \nin a responsible way and in a timely manner. But one can say, then, we \nmet our national security responsibilities. Well, not the way this \nSenator sees it. The national responsibility for national security also \ncomes to our own FBI, comes to local law enforcement, comes to our U.S. \nAttorney's Offices, and we are walking away from this.\n  The voters have said they want us to change the tone and they want us \nto change the tempo. I can honestly say that working in Commerce, \nJustice, Science Appropriations, we have had an outstanding tone. I \ncompliment my current chairman, Senator Shelby from Alabama. Gosh, we \nworked so well in producing our appropriations bill. The Senator from \nAlabama made sure I was consulted, along with my staff. We worked on \nthe compelling needs that must be funded but in a fiscally responsible \nway. That subcommittee doesn't need to change the tone, but, wow, do we \nneed to change the tempo. Not because of what Shelby and Mikulski did. \nWe did our bill; we finished it. We have moved it out of the committee. \nIt is now ready to go to the Senate floor. We did it on a bipartisan \nbasis, and we feel confident, each of us and our members, of the bill \nwe produced. So we are ready to go. We are similar to a plane circling \nthe airport, but we are running out of fuel.\n  I am concerned particularly about those programs affecting the FBI \nand Federal law enforcement agencies, as well as the locals. The FBI to \nthe sheriffs are going to be shortchanged, resulting in, I think, very \nserious consequences. We use budget-speak, Senate-speak with words such \nas ``CR'' and ``omnibus,'' but whatever we are talking about, the fact \nis we are not finishing our job, when we could have done it if there \nwas a willingness from both the House and the Republican leadership to \nmove these bills. Many of them have been worked out--again, on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  I come to you today with my great concern about the global war \nagainst terrorism. I am a member of the Intelligence Committee, I am on \nthe Appropriations Committee and I am also a member of Defense \nAppropriations, Homeland Security and also currently ranking--and soon \nto be chair--of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and \nRelated Agencies that funds particularly the FBI. I live, along with my \nconstituents, in the national capital region. We are a high-risk area. \nSo we are committed to national security--whether it is the Port of \nBaltimore or whether it is Bethesda, whether it is the Naval Academy \nand looking out for them, but we need these resources. Sure, we need to \nfund defense and homeland security, but don't we need to fund the FBI? \nThe CIA can spy around the world, but ultimately any information to \ncome back and protect us against predators here comes through the FBI. \nThe National Security Agency--hopefully, completely within the law with \nreforms that need to be made--can pull out these ``cyber snitches,'' \nwith the Internet, that is going on somewhere in the Middle East and \nprevent those attacks. We are proud of what they did in working with \nour British counterparts in London. No matter what happens over there, \nwhen it comes back here, the FBI needs to protect us. But, oh, no, we \nhave to get home. That is what I mean about cutting and running. We are \ncutting and running.\n  When we do what we are about to do soon, the FBI will be short $100 \nmillion. What does that mean? Well, it means that the FBI will not be \nable to maintain the operations tempo that they have achieved since \nSeptember 11. It means that they will not be able to hire and keep the \nagents that they have, including the important linguists. We have had \nto recruit people who can speak Farsi and a whole variety of other \nlanguages that are not well known and available in our universities. \nBut Director Miller went out and found them. They are ready to go. They \nare already being trained. But we are saying: Oh, no, we cannot hire \nyou now because the Congress had to go home. They have to cut and they \nhave to run. Let me tell you, linguists, even though the private sector \nwill hire you for more money, at an easier lifestyle, we know you were \nready to join the FBI, but we have to go fa-la-la, fa-la-la somewhere. \nThis is outrageous.\n  That is the basic kind of thing that will directly impact on our \nability to fight terrorism here at home. It is what we said during the \n9/11 Commission about the famous watch list and emerging technology. We \nhave been working on the integration of the fingerprint systems between \nthe FBI, DHS, and also Immigration, to make sure that we truly are \nstopping the people we need to stop who are trying to get into this \ncountry. But, oh, no, we are going to delay that and other \ntechnological improvements that the FBI so desperately needs. We are \nshortchanging the FBI.\n\n  Then, when we look at the global war against terrorism and how it is \nacted out in our own communities, I salute the U.S. Attorney's Office. \nFor them, this CR and this cutting and running we are doing will \nessentially mean that the U.S. attorneys will be again shortchanged. In \nmy own State, they run something called the Joint Terrorism Task Force. \nIt is the U.S. attorney who gets all of the stakeholders in the same \nroom, providing important legal guidance to all of the police chiefs, \ncertainly, in the Baltimore area, and those involved in port security \nand local law enforcement. The people from the Governor's office run \nthat. Whether it is in the national Capitol region, that we are in, or \nL.A. or New York, our U.S. attorneys run these forces. The local people \nlove it, and they are part of the global war against terrorism because \nwe don't have enough FBI agents, but with enough cops on the beat, we \ncan do that. So we are shortchanging the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n  Let's go to the Bureau of Prisons. We are going to lose correctional \nofficers. We might say that they are just thugs anyway. Let's talk \nabout those ``just thugs anyway.'' Right this minute, we are very \nconcerned and have significant flashing yellow lights about the fact \nthat right now in our Federal prisons there could be underground \nrecruitment efforts going on to recruit people for terrorism or for \nthese Latin American gangs, such as M-13. Talk to the head of the \nBureau of Prisons and to the Attorney General. We have to stand \ncentrally with own Federal prisons that we do not become the incubators \nnot only of thugs but of terrorists and terrorizing gangs in our local \ncommunities.\n  When I talk about grim and ghoulish, I am going to use an example \nthat is difficult to bring to the Senate floor. In my own State, there \nwas a gang attack, where they cut off the arms and legs of a victim, \nusing a machete. I could describe more ghoulish things, but I will not \noffend civilized people to give those examples.\n  We have to get serious. Are we going to fight the global war against \nterrorism or are we going to cut and run from the appropriations? Are \nwe going to stand up for our FBI or cut and run from our duty? Are we \ngoing to stand up for Federal law enforcement, such as the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, who are working here and \nhelped us catch the snipers and are working over there so we can deal \nwith the IEDs that are killing our troops? Are we going to stand up for \nthe DEA that is fighting drugs on the street corners of our communities \nand dealing with the drug problems in Afghanistan, with Mr. Karzai, \nthat is now funding the Taliban? Oh, no, we have to cut and run.\n  Well, I am opposed to this strategy. I oppose this do-nothing \nCongress. We could do the job. I worked with my Republican colleague \nand, I must say, he worked with me. We don't have to worry about \nchanging the tone, but we sure have to change the tempo. That is why \nthe voters made a change in the Congress. So we are going to have to \nswallow this, but I will tell you that they can count on Barb Mikulski \nnot to cut and run from her duty, her responsibility in fighting the \nglobal war against terrorism and the thugs and bums on our streets in \nAmerica.\n\n[[Page S11422]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Senate Service\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, it has been almost 6 years since I was \nsworn in as Minnesota's 33rd U.S. Senator with my friend and colleague \nPaul Wellstone at my side. I began my term hopeful and optimistic. The \nSenate was evenly divided, with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans, and \nPresident-elect George W. Bush was promising to change the tone in \nWashington with a new era of bipartisan cooperation.\n  Our country enjoyed peace and relative prosperity. Outgoing President \nBill Clinton, a Republican-controlled Congress, and over 6 years of \neconomic expansion had combined to create the first annual surpluses in \nthe Federal Government's on-budget account in 39 years, and they were \nprojected by OMB to continue for at least the next decade.\n  The Social Security trust fund's annual surpluses were going to be \nsaved in a lockbox for the upcoming retirements of a large baby boom \ngeneration. There was even discussion of paying down the national debt \nto further strengthen our financial position. Yet we still would be \nable to increase funding for such essential needs as public education, \naffordable health care, seniors' drug coverage, and infrastructure \nimprovements.\n  Just 6 years later, our country's condition has changed drastically, \nand mostly for the worse. We are mired in a disastrous war in Iraq \ndespite the heroic efforts and sacrifices by our Armed Forces. The \nfiscal integrity of the Federal budget has been destroyed, with record-\nhigh annual deficits continuing, despite budget gimmickry and a modest \neconomic recovery. The Federal tax base has been decimated by huge tax \ngiveaways to the rich and superrich that will burden our children and \ngrandchildren. The Social Security trust fund's surpluses have been \nspent every year on what the nonpartisan Concord Coalition has called \n``the most reckless fiscal policy'' in our Nation's history.\n  The Bible says if the leaders don't lead, the people perish. \nUnfortunately, the Bush administration and the Republican majority in \nCongress have not led this country well, and our people are suffering \nthe consequences: lost jobs, businesses, and farms; lost incomes, \nstandards of living, and security; and lost loved ones killed or maimed \nin Iraq.\n  We have lost the national unity which followed the terrible \natrocities of September 11, 2001, and the Bush administration has lost \nthe world's support which they had after that awful attack. The \nPresident's decision to invade Iraq unilaterally, the absence of \nweapons of mass destruction that had been the initial justification for \nthat invasion, and his administration's disastrous mismanagement of \nIraq following the overthrow of Saddam Hussein has squandered most of \nour national unity and international goodwill.\n  The Congressional Record will show that I opposed those failed \npolicies and supported other and better alternatives. I was 1 of 23 \nSenators to vote against the Iraq war resolution. I opposed the large \ntax giveaways to the rich and superrich. In fact, during my 6 years in \nthe Senate, I voted 29 times to raise my own taxes. Why? Because our \ncountry needs those tax revenues, and I can darn well afford to pay my \nfair share of them, as can all other Americans with my good fortune.\n  I tried seven times unsuccessfully to get the Senate to honor its 30-\nyear promise to school districts and schoolchildren and fully fund \nspecial education. The Senate did pass my ``Taste of Our Own Medicine'' \namendment limiting Members of Congress's prescription drug coverage to \nwhat they provided to senior citizens through Medicare. However, my \namendment was discarded by the House-Senate conference committee.\n  It has pained me deeply to see the Senate's majority lead our country \ninto what I consider the wrong direction. Our Nation's founding \nprinciple was ``we the people,'' and it remains so today. If we are not \nalways united by the common cause, we are bound together by a shared \ndestiny. If the laws this Senate passes are successful, ``we the \npeople'' benefit together. If those laws fail, we suffer together. Some \nAmericans will suffer more than others as unfair victims of social and \neconomic injustices, but ultimately all Americans cannot escape our \ncommon national fate. United we stand and succeed; divided we fall and \nfail. I regretfully believe that during my Senate term this \nadministration and its congressional followers have caused too many \ndivisions, declines, and failures.\n  Thus, I leave the Senate with strong feelings of frustration and \ndisappointment. I have been unable to pass most of what I believe was \nmost important to Minnesota, to our country, and to the world. I remain \nconvinced that those policies would improve the lives of most Americans \nfar better than what the majority here enacted.\n  A cornerstone of democracy, which I honor, is that the majority \nprevails. Winning, however, does not make them right and, \nunfortunately, it does not make them wise. In those decisions with \nwhich I have disagreed, time will tell us and the American people who \nwas right and who was wise.\n  I do want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the \nprivilege to serve these last 6 years with them. I am grateful for the \nfriendships I have made, which I hope will continue after my departure.\n  I thank my excellent staff, those here in Washington and those in \nMinnesota, for their tremendous dedication and many hours of hard work. \nMost of the successes I have enjoyed here have been the result of their \ndedication and their abilities, and I thank them again for their \nsupport.\n  I especially want to thank the people of Minnesota who gave me this \nextraordinary opportunity to serve them in the Senate. Our democracy \nis, through all of human history, throughout the entire world, the most \nadvanced and successful form of self-governance that human beings have \never devised. It is far from perfect, but it is far better than \nanything else. We who are elected as its leaders and its stewards have \nsacred duties to uphold its principles, to elevate its policies, and to \nimprove its practices before we bequeath them to our successors. I have \ndone my very best to fulfill those duties before I pass them on to my \noutstanding successor, Senator-elect Amy Klobuchar. We in the Senate \nand in the House of Representatives also have the duty to serve the \nbest interests of all Americans. To be successful and sustainable, our \nGovernment must improve the lives of all of our citizens.\n\n  Unfortunately, here in Washington, the people who already have the \nmost keep getting more than anyone else. The excessive influences of \ntheir money and political power on the Federal Government are serious \nthreats to our democracy. They skew decisions and laws in favor of the \nrich and powerful, often at the expense of other Americans: the hard-\nworking people who pay their taxes and hope their elected \nrepresentatives will look out for them in Washington. It isn't too much \nfor them to expect. However, it is too often more than they are \ngetting.\n  They are told repeatedly that new laws and policies will improve \ntheir lives. Yet their real lives become worse, not better. They \nexperience a deep disconnect between what they are told will happen and \nwhat is actually happening to them.\n  In attempts to hide those disparities, the words used in Washington \nare often carefully selected by very clever people in order to disguise \nreality rather than to describe it. For example, legislation that \nstripped many Americans of their bankruptcy protections for major \nmedical expenses was named the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer \nProtection Act. Another bill that would have increased industrial \npollution was entitled the Clear Skies Act. No Child Left Behind has \nknowingly underfunded Head Start, title I, and special education, which \nhas left millions of schoolchildren behind.\n  These discrepancies and the disparities they create will be even more \ndestructive to the American people's trust in their Government in the \nyears ahead. That is because the choices facing Congress will become \neven more difficult as the needs of an aging population grow but \nrevenues do not. In\n\n[[Page S11423]]\n\nabout a decade, the Social Security trust fund's large annual surpluses \nwill be replaced by deficits, and its IOUs from the general fund will \nadd to that fund's own chronic deficits. If combined with today's \nenormous and unsustainable balance of trade deficits and a continuing \nerosion of our manufacturing job base, the consequences could be \ncatastrophic.\n  That somber forecast has replaced my hope and optimism of 6 years ago \nto my deep regret. Following the wisdom of ``speak truth to power,'' I \npresent my truth to the world's most powerful legislative body, the \nU.S. Senate, and one of the two institutions that must act to keep our \nNation strong. I hope that you will. I will pray for your wisdom to \ndiscern what is right, for your courage to act accordingly, and for \nyour success on behalf of our great Nation and the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, for one final time, I wish to address \nthe nominee before us, Dr. Von Eschenbach, who is up for Commissioner \nof the Food and Drug Administration and who I think should not be \napproved for the position by the Senate.\n  I have considered Dr. Von Eschenbach's performance on the job for \nmore than a year now because he was appointed Acting Commissioner in \nSeptember of 2005. In fact, over the last year I have closely monitored \nhis actions, reactions, and his public and private comments to the FDA \nstaff and to the public.\n  This nominee inherited a Food and Drug Administration plagued by \ncultural and structural and personnel problems, and I surely do not \nblame him for the problems, but I have to look at whether he is the \nperson to correct those problems. Because this agency is plagued by \nthese cultural and structural and personnel problems, FDA is in \ndesperate need of a leader, a leader who can not only restore the \npublic's confidence in the agency but also restore the agency's \nconfidence in itself.\n  I met with Dr. Von Eschenbach more than once. We talked, and he \nseemed to be very nice. He has, of course, without dispute, excellent \ncredentials. He promised me full cooperation in my oversight work I was \ndoing and the investigations I was doing, but, in fact, it did not \nhappen. Instead, I had to issue two subpoenas. So far, he has not \ncomplied with those subpoenas which were issued 7 months ago. This \nreflects a lack of respect for the authority of Congress conducting its \nconstitutional responsibility of oversight of the executive branch of \nGovernment.\n  In addition, under Dr. Von Eschenbach's leadership, the FDA remains \nin a state of denial about all these cultural problems to which I have \nreferred. A coherent action plan to address the problems is nowhere to \nbe found. Dr. Von Eschenbach has told me that there is room for \nimprovement in the area of technology, but it does not appear that he \nunderstands the depth and breadth of problems affecting the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  The FDA is in serious trouble, and I am not the only one saying so. \nOver the last year, we have heard from the Government Accountability \nOffice, the Union of Concerned Scientists, and just a few months ago we \nhad a scathing report from the Institute of Medicine.\n  The Institute of Medicine completed a $3 million, 15-month study and \nset forth 25 recommendations. This report by the Institute of Medicine \nconveys a sense of urgency to fix the problems. Just last month at the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing, the chairman \nof the Institute of Medicine committee that produced the report said:\n\n       If there ever was a time that it was critical to address \n     these issues, it is now.\n\n  The next Food and Drug Administration Commissioner must be a person \nwho not only has excellent credentials, as I have said he has, but who \nalso will accept the criticism of the agency and develop coherent \nsolutions.\n  Here is what the Institute of Medicine reported:\n\n       The committee believes that cultural changes are urgently \n     needed to support a stronger, more systematic and more \n     credible approach to drug safety in the Center of Drug \n     Evaluation and Review and it recommends solutions to the \n     problems created or exacerbated by the elements of the \n     Center's management, structure and environment.\n\n  Now a short quote:\n\n       Many have observed signs of an organizational culture in \n     crisis.\n\n  Another quote:\n\n       The Center's leaders have to be prepared to address the \n     underlying cultural problems that divide and impair the \n     optimal functioning of the Center's staff and effectively use \n     the existing and new authorities and resources to achieve the \n     Center's public health and regulatory mission.\n\n  These criticisms of the Food and Drug Administration have come from \noutside the agency, not from whistleblowers reporting to me. But I also \ncontinue to hear from these employees inside and also from managers \ninside the Food and Drug Administration who were concerned about the \nintegrity of the Food and Drug Administration's work. What is also \ntroubling is that some of these employees have experienced intimidation \nor reprisals for voicing legitimate concerns.\n  I have fought long and hard over the last two decades to protect the \nrights of numerous whistleblowers who expose fraud, waste, and abuse. \nWhen I met with Dr. Von Eschenbach in March, he told me that he was \n``committed to whistleblowers.'' Yet his actions seem to suggest \notherwise.\n  The worst example may be when Dr. Von Eschenbach ordered a meeting \nwith the FDA staff after the press reported information that was \ncritical of how the FDA handled safety issues with the drug Ketek. I \nkeep referring to Ketek because it is a drug involved in the death of \nan 18-year-old boy in Cedar Rapids, IA. As I understand it, Dr. Von \nEschenbach sent a clear message at this staff meeting. Some suggested \nthat this attempt was simply to boost morale among FDA employees, but \nsome longtime FDA employees saw it differently. They took his word that \nanybody who spoke ``outside the locker room'' might find themselves \n``kicked off the team''--literally. And I don't blame them for taking \noffense at that. People are trying to do their job, and you talk about \nwhat is wrong and you might be fired for it? People like that ought to \nbe upheld and honored. In the final analysis, they ought to have their \nconcerns addressed within the agency and not have to come to those of \nus in Congress because they are not getting any ear in the agency. So \nthey took his message to mean: Your career is in jeopardy if you happen \nto come to Senator Grassley or outside the agency or to any Member of \nCongress. To me, it shows his poor judgment and intolerance for \ndissenting opinions and also for what is basic to American government, \nthat the public's business ought to be public.\n  Dr. Von Eschenbach also told me that he was a man of ``discipline, \nrigor and precision.'' Those are his words. He used those same words in \na speech:\n\n       We will retain all the rigor, all the discipline and all \n     the precision of regulation, but our efforts will be geared \n     so that things can move faster rather than slower.''\n\n  We can all agree that new drugs and devices should be available to \nthe public as soon as possible, but there is also the issue of safety \nand the protection of the public. The FDA must do its job and ensure \nthat the drug's benefits outweigh its risks before approval.\n  My other concern regarding Dr. Von Eschenbach is that he assured me \nof his commitment to respond promptly to requests from Congress. That \nis a promise which was never kept. So do I have a reason to be \nconcerned about this person, regardless of the very good credentials he \nhas? My oversight of the FDA has consequently been slowed by inaction \non the part of his agency. In fact, he has not responded to a letter I \nsent to him 9 months ago, and my requests for interviews with some FDA \nofficials were ignored for more than 3 months and some still have not \nbeen scheduled. As Acting Commissioner, he has ignored congressional \nrequests, and I do not expect that will change if he is confirmed by \nthe Senate.\n  Before I close my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in\n\n[[Page S11424]]\n\nthe Record the full text of a letter I sent to the Acting Commissioner \nin September.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2006.\n     Andrew C. Von Eschenbach, M.D.,\n     Acting Commissioner, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, \n         Rockville, MD.\n       Dear Dr. Von Eschnbach: As a senior member of the United \n     States Senate and as the Chairman of the Committee on Finance \n     (Committee), it is my constitutional duty to conduct \n     oversight into the actions of executive branch agencies. For \n     nearly three years, I have been investigating matters related \n     to, among other things, the safety and efficacy of products \n     regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or \n     agency).\n       I have reviewed and questioned how the FDA handles the pre-\n     market review and postmarket surveillance of drugs, \n     biologics, devices and veterinary medicines to assess whether \n     or not the agency is fulfilling its mission to protect the \n     public health. Additionally, I have worked to give voice to \n     the concerns of a number of rank-and-file scientists and FDA \n     managers who share a common complaint: a deep-seated cultural \n     divide exists within the FDA, and it has led to systemic \n     problems that plague the agency. Together we have shed \n     sunlight on how frequently differences of scientific opinion \n     are quashed, the nature of the cozy relationship between the \n     FDA and the industries it is supposed to regulate, and the \n     failure of the agency to be adequately transparent and \n     accountable to the public.\n       Others also have identified serious leadership problems at \n     the FDA. Editorial pages of publications across the nation, \n     including a number of the most esteemed scientific journals, \n     have recognized and expressed outrage at the FDA's failures \n     in recent years. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), \n     the independent and non-partisan agency that works on behalf \n     of Congress and the American people, has also identified \n     serious and systemic problems at the FDA. Still, the most \n     powerful messages come from the increasing numbers of current \n     and former FDA personnel, who often come forward at great \n     personal and professional expense to express their \n     disenchantment that the FDA has lost its way and ``sold out'' \n     to the industries it is charged to regulate.\n       In the face of such criticism, the FDA appears to be \n     focused on damage control rather than addressing its core \n     problems. As a science-based agency, the FDA is remarkable \n     for its lack of introspection, second-guessing, and failure \n     to assess its own performance and capabilities in a \n     systematic way. Despite all the recent criticism, the \n     agency does not have a comprehensive plan of action in \n     place to address its weaknesses. Instead, the FDA comes \n     off as an agency in denial that chooses to keep its head \n     in the sand in the hope its problems will go away. I am \n     writing this letter to encourage you to establish and \n     implement a resuscitation plan to restore the FDA's \n     credibility in the mind of its own employees and the \n     American public. An agency that hemorrhages whistleblowers \n     is an agency needing critical care. The following concerns \n     are by no means comprehensive, but they illustrate several \n     common themes of my oversight of the FDA.\n\n\n                   Suppression of Scientific Dissent\n\n       I am very troubled by FDA's attempts to suppress scientific \n     dissent by muzzling its own scientists. Such actions by the \n     FDA show a lack of respect for the dedicated scientists \n     working at the agency and a lack of respect for the \n     scientific process.\n       In February 2004, the FDA held an advisory committee \n     meeting to discuss whether or not there was a link between \n     some antidepressant drugs and suicidal behavior in children. \n     Dr. Andrew Mosholder, the FDA's expert on this matter, \n     concluded that there was a link. However, his FDA supervisors \n     disagreed and canceled Dr. Mosholder's presentation to the \n     advisory committee. Instead, Dr. Mosholder was given a script \n     by his supervisors to read if he were asked why he was no \n     longer presenting before the advisory committee.\n       Similarly, in February 2005, Dr. David Graham was finishing \n     a study on Medicaid patients taking COX-2 inhibitors and was \n     told by his supervisors that he could not present his \n     findings regarding these drugs at an upcoming advisory \n     committee meeting. The scientific process ultimately \n     prevailed, but only after then-Acting Commissioner Lester \n     Crawford overruled Dr. Graham's supervisors to allow him to \n     present his findings. This was not the FDA's first attempt, \n     however, to muzzle Dr. Graham. Several months prior to the \n     advisory committee meeting, Dr. Graham went public with \n     allegations about the FDA's mishandling of the COX-2 \n     inhibitor Vioxx, which was manufactured by Merck & Co, Inc. \n     (Merck). According to Dr. Graham himself, as well as \n     information and documents obtained by the Committee, senior \n     FDA officials attempted to intimidate him so he would not \n     testify about the adverse cardiac effects of Vioxx before \n     Congress. The FDA also tried to prevent the publication of \n     Dr. Graham's findings in Lancet.\n       In July 2005, the FDA approved the Vagus Nerve Stimulation \n     (VNS) Therapy System, a medical device for treatment-\n     resistant depression (TRD), even when FDA scientists could \n     not determine if the device worked. Rather than allow the \n     scientific process to dictate FDA's decision, a senior FDA \n     official overruled a team of more than 20 FDA scientists, \n     medical officers, and management staff who recommended \n     against approval of the device based on their comprehensive \n     scientific evaluation of the sponsor's application. In \n     addition, while the FDA has publicized differences of \n     scientific opinion within the agency regarding controversial \n     regulatory decisions in the past, in this case, the FDA did \n     not publicize scientific dissent regarding the effectiveness \n     of the VNS Therapy System for TRD.\n       More recently, my office was approached by yet another FDA \n     scientist who is being prohibited from submitting an article \n     to a major scientific journal despite the fact that an \n     appropriate disclosure statement would be made.\n\n\n                    Cozy Relationship with Industry\n\n       I have frequently criticized the FDA for its relationship \n     with the industry, which I believe is far too cozy. The FDA \n     needs to distance itself from the industry and return to its \n     role as regulator, not a facilitator. Despite findings from a \n     Merck study that heart attacks were five times higher for \n     Vioxx patients than for patients on another drug, nearly two \n     years passed before label changes were made. The overriding \n     concern of the FDA should have been the health and safety of \n     the American people. However, while the FDA was negotiating \n     label changes with the company, patients and doctors remained \n     largely unaware of the cardiovascular risks. In addition, \n     Merck was aggressively marketing Vioxx during that time.\n       Another troubling example of FDA's coziness with industry \n     is the removal of Dr. Victoria Hampshire, a drug safety \n     reviewer, from the review of ProHeart 6, a heartworm \n     prevention drug for dogs. Dr. Hampshire was reassigned \n     following the drug company's presentation of findings from \n     its private investigation of Dr. Hampshire after the company \n     met with then-Commissioner. It appears the purpose of that \n     investigation was retaliatory and an effort to discredit Dr. \n     Hampshire. The company's investigation led to a criminal \n     investigation by the FDA; however, the investigation resulted \n     in no action taken against Dr. Hampshire. In fact, Dr. \n     Hampshire subsequently received an award for her job \n     performance related to ProHeart 6.\n       Unfortunately; it appears that Dr. Hampshire is not the \n     only FDA employee who was the target of a company's campaign \n     to discredit individuals who may present impediments to its \n     agenda. Two months ago, I wrote to the Department of Health \n     and Human Services Office of Inspector General (HHS OIG) to \n     investigate whether or not one or more FDA employees \n     conspired with Merck to discredit Dr. Graham and/or call into \n     question Dr. Graham's allegations regarding the safety and \n     efficacy of Vioxx. FDA's handling of the antibiotic Ketek is \n     another example where the FDA appears to have accommodated a \n     drug company despite the fact that the company submitted \n     fraudulent data from a safety study to the FDA and repeatedly \n     provided incomplete safety information. What baffles me even \n     more is the fact that the FDA continued to cite Study 3014 in \n     publicly released safety information for Ketek even after its \n     Division of Scientific Investigations concluded that Study \n     3014 involved ``multiple instances of fraud'' and that ``the \n     integrity of data from all sites involved in [the] study . . \n     . cannot be assured with any degree of confidence.''\n\n\n                Pressure to Alter or Exclude Information\n\n       Not only has the FDA disregarded and downplayed important \n     concerns and warnings from its own scientists, but FDA \n     supervisors have also pressured some of these scientists to \n     change their findings or conclusions regarding the safety \n     and/or efficacy of a product. Most notably Dr. Mosholder and \n     Dr. Graham, among others, have been pressured by their \n     supervisors to soften their safety findings or conclusions \n     regarding antidepressants and Vioxx, respectively. In \n     addition, a survey released by the Union of Concerned \n     Scientists (UCS) and the Public Employees for Environmental \n     Responsibility (PEER) on July 20, 2006, found that \n     approximately one-fifth of the nearly 1,000 FDA scientists \n     surveyed said that they had been asked, for nonscientific \n     reasons, to inappropriately exclude or alter technical \n     information or their conclusions. One-fifth said that they \n     have been asked explicitly by FDA decision-makers to provide \n     incomplete, inaccurate or misleading information to the \n     public, industry, the media and government officials. My \n     Committee staff are presently reviewing such allegations \n     in ongoing investigations.\n\n\n                      Pressure to Approve Products\n\n       Throughout numerous investigations by my Committee staff, \n     FDA employees have also stated that they are under constant \n     pressure to approve drugs within deadlines established by the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act. For example, during the \n     Committee's investigation into the delay in labeling changes \n     regarding blindness risks for Viagra, the safety evaluator \n     for that drug informed my staff that the Office of New Drugs \n     is under such time pressure to approve new drugs that safety \n     concerns were often ``fit in'' wherever they could. According \n     to a survey by the HHS OIG in 2002, nearly one in five \n     scientists polled said that they had been pressured to \n     approve or recommend approval of a new drug despite concerns \n     about its safety, effectiveness, or quality. This needs to be\n\n[[Page S11425]]\n\n     corrected immediately, and FDA needs to resume its science-\n     based mission.\n\n\n                     Atmosphere of Fear of Reprisal\n\n       According to the FDA, there are regulations and procedures \n     in place to help resolve organizational and individual \n     disagreements. However, my Committee staff continues to hear \n     from FDA employees who experience intimidation and \n     reassignments when they raise concerns about the integrity of \n     FDA's work. In addition, the 2006 UCS and PEER survey found \n     that over one-third of the FDA scientists who responded to \n     the survey said they could not openly express any concerns \n     about public health within FDA without fear of retaliation. \n     Moreover, the GAO found that the dispute resolution processes \n     for disagreements over postmarket drug safety decisions \n     ``have not been used and may not be viewed as sufficiently \n     independent.''\n       Your recent meeting with FDA staff involved in the review \n     of Ketek is a disturbing example that FDA's internal dispute \n     resolution processes are not working. Instead of reassuring \n     FDA employees that they can raise concerns without being \n     subjected to retaliation or intimidation, the meeting itself \n     appears to be an act of intimidation. Scientists who speak up \n     about problems and concerns, whether internally or \n     externally, help ensure that our government operates \n     efficiently, effectively, and in the best interest of the \n     American people. FDA employees need to hear from the leader \n     of the agency that they can freely voice their concerns \n     without fear of reprisal.\n\n\n                       Organizational Challenges\n\n       The GAO report released on April 21, 2006, calls for long \n     overdue reform at the FDA. Under the current FDA review \n     system, patient safety takes a back seat to the fast approval \n     of products. For example, the drug safety office, now known \n     as the Office of Surveillance and Epidemiology, is under the \n     thumb of the Office of New Drugs (OND), which is hampered by \n     real and perceived conflicts of interest. According to the \n     GAO report, the drug safety office is under-funded, lacks \n     independence and lacks decision-making responsibility. OND--\n     which is responsible for approving or disapproving drug \n     applications in the first place--is the office responsible \n     for taking regulatory actions related to the safety of drugs \n     already on the market, not the drug safety office.\n       To improve the decision-making process for postmarket drug \n     safety, the GAO has recommended that Congress expand the \n     FDA's authority to require drug companies to conduct \n     postmarket studies when additional data is needed. A number \n     of us in Congress have repeatedly asked the FDA what \n     additional authorities and/or resources are needed to enable \n     the agency to achieve its mission. In a related matter, \n     during private meetings with FDA management, the need to have \n     pharmaceutical companies submit their applications for new \n     drugs and other requests electronically comes up repeatedly \n     as critical to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of \n     the FDA. Yet, the FDA continuously denies the need for \n     greater authority and resources. Why the FDA is resisting \n     such offers from Congress is a mystery to me.\n\n\n                           Lack of Leadership\n\n       The FDA has been without a permanent leader more often than \n     not in recent years. The agency needs and deserves a strong, \n     permanent Commissioner who is unequivocally committed to the \n     scientific process and can make the administrative reforms \n     necessary to ensure greater transparency and accountability. \n     While you are not the permanent Commissioner of the agency, \n     you are nevertheless in the position, as Acting Commissioner, \n     to turn things around and restore public confidence in the \n     FDA. I sincerely hope you seize the opportunity to do just \n     that.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The letter lays out the major problems at the FDA. I \nencourage my colleagues to read it and, maybe more important, emphasize \nagain reading the Institute of Medicine's criticism of the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  The FDA needs a permanent commissioner to tackle these problems. \nUnfortunately, I believe the nominee is not the person for the job. \nOver the past year, the nominee has failed to step to the plate and \nfailed to keep his assurances to me. He has said the agency needs to be \na facilitator, but think what the word ``facilitate'' means or what \n``being a facilitator'' means. It could mean a cozy relationship \nbetween the FDA and industry. What is called for is someone who \nrecognizes that the FDA is supposed to be a regulator, not a \nfacilitator.\n  I am also afraid he will allow FDA management to continue pressuring \nFDA scientists to change their findings or conclusions and to approve \nthe products despite concerns about the safety and efficacy of the \nproduct. Dr. Von Eschenbach is not prepared to provide the leadership \nnecessary to restore confidence in the FDA.\n  Given these concerns, I hope my colleagues will take them in \nconsideration before they vote. I intend to vote no. I hope my \ncolleagues will so that we can have a person in this position who will \nchange the culture but also cooperate with the constitutional \nresponsibilities of the Congress of the United States to oversee the \nexecutive branch.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take just 5 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  Gratitude For Expressions of Concern\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to express my \ngratitude for the response I have gotten over the last month from my \nfriends and neighbors in the Senate.\n  As many of you know, about on election day I was diagnosed with \nleukemia, and I have spent the last month in the hospital. I got out \nlast Saturday, and I am now back on the job, and I am very delighted to \ndo that. Certainly Susan and I wish to express our real thank-you for \nall the comments and contacts, expressions of hope, and prayers we have \ngotten from the Members in the Senate. It is very meaningful. It is the \nfirst time I have been through a thing of this kind, and I can tell you \nthat it means a great deal. We also got literally hundreds of comments \nfrom our voters in Wyoming. So we are so pleased, so grateful for that \nkind of response.\n  The process has gone well. As I said, I was in there for a month. I \nhave gone through the chemo, I have gone through the other activities \nand may have to go back for some additional treatments, but the fact is \nI am out, my blood cell count is up, and I am very positive.\n  I want to urge people to be very careful about their own health, and \nwhen there are signs of problems, to be sure they take care of them \nbecause Bethesda was a wonderful place for me to be.\n  Again, my real purpose here is just to express my gratitude for all \nthe kind feelings I have had from the staff and from the Members of the \nSenate, and I appreciate it very much. It has been very helpful, and I \nam grateful.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Honoring Senatorial Service\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had the privilege of being here for \nthe 28th year beginning shortly. I calculated not long ago that I have \nserved with 261 individuals. I am not about to try and review all of \nthe many magnificent friendships I am privileged to have through these \nyears. Indeed, if one looks at the rewards, of which there are many \nserving in this historic institution, the Senate, it is the personal \nbonds, the friendships that we so firmly cement and that will last a \nlifetime as a consequence of our duties of serving the United States of \nAmerica and in our respective States.\n  We are called ``United States'' Senators. I often believe it is the \nfirst obligation, our Nation, the Republic for which it stands.\n\n\n                              George Allen\n\n  For my colleague now of 6 years, George Allen, this will be his last \nservice as a Senator as this brief session closes. I have said it \nbefore, I will say it again and again, I rank him at the very top of \nthe 261 Senators I have been privileged to serve with these many years.\n  In fact, I have looked back at the history of Virginia and would like \nto note for the record that my colleague, George Allen, is one of only \nfive Virginians to have served in the Virginia General Assembly, as \nGovernor, as a Member of the House of Representatives; and as a U.S. \nSenator--the first in more than 150 years of our State's history.\n  Together, we have shared a long history of serving the people of \nVirginia--I as a Senator and he as a member of the Virginia House of \nDelegates, House of Representatives, Governor, and U.S. Senator. I \nremember participating in\n\n[[Page S11426]]\n\nhis first campaign and all the successive campaigns. George Allen \nserved the Commonwealth of Virginia in public office for 25 years. How \nwell I know. I campaigned for him when he ran for the State \nlegislature, then for the Congress, then for Governor, and he won those \nelections handily. Then he ran for the Senate. It was a tough race. \nTough because he was up against a very able opponent, a man whom I \nadmire, a man with whom I have served with in this Chamber. But the \nvoters of Virginia--and therein rests the final decision--sent George \nAllen to the Senate where I believe he has served with great \ndistinction.\n  I have been privileged to share the warmth and vigor of this \nmagnificent man with his lovely wife Susan and their children, Tyler, \nForest, and Brooke. What a privilege, a joy for me to see them as they \nhave grown nourished by the love of two strong parents.\n  In 1981 he was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates to the seat \nonce held by his philosophical inspiration, Thomas Jefferson. \nThroughout his career in public office, George Allen has consistently \nbeen guided by that same inspiration of smaller government and \nindividual freedom. He has also been driven by the thoughts of two \nother leaders important to him; Ronald Reagan who said ``If not us who, \nif not now when?'' and his father who always told him ``The future is \nnow.''\n  Throughout his career in public service George has worked as an \nadvocate of economic development, recruiting companies to Virginia and \nespousing policies to create jobs. As Governor, he oversaw the creation \nof 312,000 new jobs in Virginia by making the Commonwealth a better \nplace to do business. He reformed the parole system to keep repeat \noffenders off our streets and out of our neighborhoods. His welfare \nreform set the stage for the Congress to act to help people get back on \ntheir feet and get back to work. He implemented the Standards of \nLearning in our schools to make sure all of our children receive the \nsame quality education.\n  I remember well our first effort together when he came to the Senate \nin 2001. As is often the case here in the Senate, there had been some \nproblems confirming a federal judge who was ultimately recess appointed \nin late 2000. We came together and worked with the President to bring \nhis nomination back to the Senate and as a result, Judge Roger Gregory \nwas confirmed by the Senate to become the first African American seated \non the Fourth Circuit of the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  We were working partners. We shared everything--our staffs work \ntogether, our wives work together--and we crisscrossed this State from \none end to the other over those 6 years. When either George Allen or I \nfelt, for whatever reason, we could not keep an appointment somewhere \nin the State, one would fill in for the other.\n  We were quite parallel in our thinking, the philosophy, the things so \nimportant to Virginians, and I think to most Americans, first and \nforemost the preservations of our freedoms, a strong national defense, \na right to work, to hold a job and to compete fairly, to hold that job \nand to advance, to have a system of health care that did not serve only \nthose more affluent than others but would serve any individual who \nsuffered from pain or the need for medical attention.\n  We have joined together in countless efforts for Virginia's \ncommunities; helping to fund museums, youth centers, innumerable \ninfrastructure projects, and research at our colleges and universities. \nWe also worked together on the Teacher Tax Relief Act. I am very \nhopeful if we pass this tax package, there will be a provision that \nGeorge and I worked on together for many years, to be extended in \nstatute; and that is, the Teacher Tax Relief Act. I will never forget, \nI was down visiting a small school. And as is so often the case, you \nare rushed through, and the teachers and the principal want you to meet \nas many students as you possibly can. It is always quite interesting to \ndo that.\n  I remember I was rushed into one class, and I think they were first \ngraders. They were all sitting on the floor, and the principal said: \nYou have a few minutes. So I started talking away, and I asked the \nfirst graders: Is there a question you might have? And this absolutely \nmagnificent little girl, who sat there riveted to every word I spoke, \nlooked up and said: Yes. My question is, how much longer must we sit \nhere until the Senator comes? Well, you don't forget those things. And \nI had difficulty answering the question, I was so taken aback. I felt I \nwas universally recognized, but it is not the case in the first grade.\n  Then I was in another classroom, and for some reason I--I went \nthrough basic engineering school, and I have always been interested in \npencils and writing instruments--and I saw a pencil, a rather fancy \none, and I picked it up, and the teacher saw that I liked it, and she \nsaid: Take it. Keep it. I said: Oh, no, I don't take any gifts or \nanything. You know, we have rigid rules in the Senate, and nobody is \ngoing to bribe me with a pencil. And she said: Oh, please, please, \nplease. It is not school property. I said: Oh? She said: Yes. Senator, \nyou must understand that as teachers--and this is prevalent not only in \nVirginia but it is prevalent all across the land, particularly among \nteachers in the elementary grades--we have to take part of our own \nsalary to buy what we deem are the essential tools that are needed to \neducate our students.\n  Well, I just could not believe this, because teachers are not among \nthe more well paid. So George Allen and I fought for years to get the \nTeacher Tax Relief Act signed into law. It is on the books, and we need \nto extend it, and I am optimistic that will be done. But it simply \nsays, if you can establish that you took your own salary and you bought \nschool supplies which were necessary for teaching and the profession \nyou are in, you get a $250 above the line deduction--a small amount of \nmoney, but a great sense of satisfaction.\n  George has been a strong member of the Commerce and Foreign Relations \nCommittees seeking to make our nation a better place for business, \nultimately creating more economic opportunity for all Americans.\n  We joined together after the tragic events of September 11, 2001, to \ntry to help the people of Northern Virginia and indeed all America \nrespond and recover.\n  We worked on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces. How \nproud we are in the Commonwealth of Virginia of the extensive number of \nbases and institutions of the U.S. military which we are privileged to \nhave. There is no greater responsibility of the Congress of the United \nStates than its specific--specific--obligation under the Constitution. \nAs my great teacher and mentor, Senator Byrd, so often has told me, \nthat is to provide for the care and the welfare, and to raise the \narmies and maintain the navies that this Nation requires. George Allen \nhas been a partner with me as we have done those things for these many \nyears.\n  In life we go through a series of stages. We are raised and nurtured \nby our parents, receive an education, raise a family of our own, and \nserve in various careers. George Allen and his family have been public \nservants to the people of Virginia and America for the past 25 years. \nThe people have been fortunate to have such a dedicated Delegate, \nCongressman, Governor, and U.S. Senator. I am proud to have served with \nthis man and to call him my friend all these years. Therefore, I bid \nhim a fond farewell from this institution. But I look forward to \nworking with him as he goes on and accepts challenges perhaps even \ngreater than the ones he had in the years that he so loved serving in \nthis Chamber.\n  The people of Virginia spoke, and George Allen, with great courage, \ntook that decision and quickly said: I understand. He accepted it and \nhas gone on about his business.\n  I would also like to pay tribute to nine other United States Senators \nwho will retire from the Senate in the coming days.\n  I have previously spoken in honor of my colleague from the \nneighboring state of Maryland, Senator Paul Sarbanes. Since my first \ndays in the Senate, Senator Sarbanes and I worked together on a host of \nimportant regional initiatives, including: the restoration of the \nChesapeake Bay; improvements to our Metro system; the creation of the \noffice of the National Capital Region Coordinator; and on funding for \nthe construction of the new Woodrow Wilson bridge. His retirement\n\n[[Page S11427]]\n\nis certainly a loss to the region as Senator Sarbanes has been a true \nchampion of many issues vital to the Maryland, Virginia, and DC \nmetropolitan area.\n  Now, I would like to take a few moments to salute our majority \nleader--Senator Frist--as well as Senators Chafee, Burns, Santorum, \nDeWine, Jeffords, Talent, and Dayton. Each and every one of these U.S. \nSenators has served his State and his country with great distinction.\n  Without a doubt, I could speak at-length in honor of each of these \noutstanding individuals. In light of time constraints, however, and the \nfact that so many of my colleagues wish to similarly pay tribute, I \nshall endeavor to keep my remarks brief.\n  First, I would like to say a few words about our distinguished \nmajority leader, Senator Bill Frist. You know, in this post-September \n11, 2001, world, we think of national security as the most important \nissue of the day. Certainly, Bill has worked hard in that area over the \nyears--not only as majority leader but as a hard-working member of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. But, right behind national security \ncomes the issue of the health of our citizens, and Bill Frist has been \nat the forefront of every major piece of health care legislation during \nhis 12 years in the Senate.\n  Whether it has been ensuring that America's seniors have access to a \nsorely needed Medicare prescription drug benefit or whether it has been \nhis efforts to encourage the use of new technology in medicine so that \nthe knowledge of one doctor in one part of the world could help a \ndoctor and a patient in another part of the world, Bill Frist has \nimproved the healthcare system for all Americans.\n  The Senate will no doubt miss Bill Frist's leadership, but I have no \ndoubt that his public service will continue, particularly his heartfelt \nhealthcare work in impoverished areas of the world. I wish him, and his \nmagnificent wife Karen all of the best in their future.\n  Now, I will speak a few words about our colleague Lincoln Chafee. I \nhave known the Chafee family for many years, and count the late John \nChafee and his wife Virginia as my dearest friends.\n  The year was 1969, this country was engulfed in a war in Vietnam, and \nI was privileged to be asked to serve as Under Secretary of the Navy. I \nwas told that the Secretary of the Navy, who would be my boss one step \nup, would be a man named John Chafee, former Governor of the State of \nRhode Island.\n  I will never forget we both served in the Marines, at different \ntimes. He was a captain and I was a captain in the Marine Corps \nReserve, and we met on a cold day in February outside the Pentagon, \nshook hands, and walked upstairs. And there we were greeted by the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations.\n  Chafee turned to me, and he said: You know, the Navy and the Marine \nCorps constitute almost a million uniformed men and women. It was that \nlarge in the height of the war in Vietnam. And he said: Here we are, a \ncouple of lowly captains, and now it is our responsibility. Let's \nsquare our jaws and stick out our chins, get this job done, and provide \nthe leadership that these men and women of the Armed Forces so richly \ndeserve.\n  John Chafee was an absolute teacher and mentor of mine in every way \nduring those years we worked together in the Department of Defense. He \nwould take his trip to Vietnam. I would stay back and man the store. He \nwould return, and I would take my trip. We had problems throughout the \nworld. It was in the middle of the Cold War with the Soviet Union. John \nChafee was a magnificent man. He had been Governor of the State of \nRhode Island three times, and he was a magnificent leader of the men \nand women of the Armed Forces.\n\n  He decided that he was going to move on and consider running for the \nSenate, and resigned, and I succeeded him then as Secretary. But I \nnever lost the feeling that he was right there, should I need him to \nhelp carry out my duties. And then, as luck and good fortune would have \nit, he came to the Senate, and not too many years thereafter I came to \nthe Senate and once again joined him.\n  I will never forget my first day in the Senate he came up to me and \nsaid: Do you remember I was Secretary and you were Under Secretary? I \nsaid: Yes, sir. He said: Well, that's the way it's going to be here for \na while. You listen to what I say and what I do, and I will give you \nsome advice as we go along.\n  That was the kind of man he was. I never heard him speak a harsh word \nabout any other colleague. But he achieved his special niche in this \ninstitution through his absolute love for the environment as well as \nthe men and women of the Armed Forces. Those were the two things on \nwhich he worked. And as luck would have it, his son came to join us, \nand he has so many of those magnificent attributes of his father and \nhis mother. An absolutely magnificent human being, his mother, and all \nhis family, as a matter of fact.\n  It is my honor to share with my colleagues some of the important \naccomplishment of Lincoln Chafee during his 7 years as a member of this \nbody, and to personally express my appreciation for his service to our \ncountry.\n  Senator Linc Chafee came to the Senate from local government serving \non the city council and later as mayor of Warwick. I believe it is this \nexperience of leading a major city that solidified his commitment to \nfiscal responsibility. In his service in the Senate he was steadfast in \nhis belief to restore controls on the federal budget and to promote \nresponsible government spending.\n  We were privileged to serve together on the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works where he quickly became a skilled legislator. He \nsuccessfully authored legislation to stimulate the redevelopment of \nbrownfields areas previously contaminated by hazardous waste, that \nplague our urban areas. This law is already producing results in \nimproving neighborhoods and bringing new industries back to urban \nareas.\n  Senator Chafee was also a leading voice in fostering bipartisanship \nin the Senate, and was an active member of our informal group of \nSenators known as the Gang of 14. We were a group of seven Republicans \nand seven Democrats, but we had no formal standing in the Senate. We \nwould meet regularly to share our thoughts on judicial nominees pending \non the Senate Calendar to ensure that the Senate could continue its \nresponsibilities under article II, section 2, of the U.S. \nConstitution--the advice and consent clause. Senator Chafee was an \nintegral part of this effort which allowed candid and respectful \ndiscussions of the qualifications of individuals to serve in the \nfederal judiciary and prevented the continued use of party-led \nfilibusters on judicial nominees except in extraordinary circumstances.\n  Linc Chafee will be remembered in this institution for his \nindependence. We all fight to try to maintain that independence. We are \nrespectful of our party leadership. We are respectful of our party \naffiliations. We know the demands of our State. But there are times \nwhen we feel we must act and make decisions that reflect our own \ninnermost feelings of independence, and Lincoln Chafee will be \nremembered for that.\n  As Senator Chafee prepares to depart the Senate, I thank him for his \nmeaningful contributions to the Senate, and wish him, his wife \nStephanie, and his children, Louisa, Caleb and Thea, ``fair winds and \nfollowing seas.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about Conrad Burns. \nSenator Conrad Burns has an impressive record of public service, \nbeginning with his service in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1955 to 1957. \nConrad has served the great State of Montana with distinction in the \nU.S. Senate since 1989.\n  I will never forget when his first campaign came along, I was asked \nto go out and campaign with him. I acknowledged I would do it. I didn't \nknow him, so I went on out to Montana. I had been in Montana in earlier \nyears. I had been actually an employee of the U.S. Park Service and had \nbeen a firefighter out in Montana in 1943 and then again in 1947, I \nthink it was.\n  Most recently, in August I toured Malmstrom Air Force Base with \nSenator Burns. On this tour, I saw firsthand the love and pride that \nSenator Burns has for the people of his State. As a senior member of \nthe Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, he has worked \ntirelessly for the men and women in the Armed Forces.\n  And old Conrad--he embodies all of those great qualities of Montana. \nTalk\n\n[[Page S11428]]\n\nabout independence, he has it, and robustness, and a thirst for life \nand laughter. It was a sheer joy to campaign with Conrad Burns because \nwherever he went, he would walk into a room and he would tell a story, \ntalk to his people.\n  He loves every square foot of that State. And I shall miss him. I \nshall dearly miss Conrad Burns. We have to have a few characters around \nhere who do our duties and accept our daily bread, and he is one. And \nyou could kind of go to the bank on what he told you. He was never at a \nloss for telling a story to cheer up a colleague. Whenever he felt that \ncolleague was a bit down, Conrad would cheer that colleague up. He and \nhis lovely wife and family will go on to other challenges.\n  Senator Rick Santorum has an impressive record of public service. \nSubsequent to his service in local and state government, he was elected \nto the United States House of Representatives. In 1994, Rick was \nelected for the first time to the United States Senate. From his first \nday in the Senate until 2002 we had the opportunity to serve together \non the Senate Armed Services Committee. Throughout his time on that \nCommittee, and since he left the Committee, Rick could always be \ncounted on for his deliberate and reasoned decisionmaking to ensure the \nbest possible policies for the men and women in the armed forces. Since \n2001, Senator Santorum has also played an important role in the Senate \nleadership as Republican conference chairman. As conference chairman, \nSenator Santorum has tirelessly represented the Republican Party as the \nparty spokesman. There is no doubt in my mind that Rick Santorum's \npassion, enthusiasm, and leadership will be missed here in the Senate.\n\n  Senator Mike DeWine has been in public service nearly his entire \nadult life. He was an assistant prosecuting attorney, he has held \nvarious state elected positions, he was a member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, and most recently, since 1995, he has served the state \nof Ohio in the U.S. Senate. I am pleased to have served on the HELP \nCommittee with Senator DeWine where we worked together on various \nchildren's health issues. There is not a bigger champion of children's \nhealth than Senator DeWine. Senator DeWine was also an instrumental \nmember with me on the Gang of 14. Throughout his years in the Senate, \nSenator DeWine has proven to be a thoughtful, highly respected member \nwho has always been willing to do what is right. In my view, he is a \ntrue statesman.\n  From 1956 to 1959, Senator Jim Jeffords served in the United States \nNavy. He later served in the Naval Reserves. In 1989, after Jim had \nserved the citizens of Vermont in State positions and in the United \nHouse of Representatives, Jim was elected to the United States Senate. \nIn the Senate, I have been pleased to work closely with him, \nparticularly in serving with him on the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and on the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nJim chaired both Committees during his years in the Senate.\n  While Senator Jeffords legislatively had many interests, I believe \nthat improving the education of our children, particularly children \nwith special needs, is the issue most dear to his heart. I remember him \ntime and time again on the floor of the United States Senate pushing \nfor increased funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct, IDEA. And, I remember joining him, and others, in pushing hard for \nmandatory IDEA funding after it became clear that the Congress would be \nunable to fulfill its funding commitment through the discretionary \nfunding process. While, to date, we have not achieved full funding, it \nis without question that Jim Jeffords' Senate career has left a \nlasting, positive imprint that will improve America's education system \nfor years to come.\n  Over the past 4 years, I have been fortunate to have been given the \nopportunity to work closely with Jim Talent on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee. Since his first day on the Committee--Jim Talent \nhas been one of the hardest working Committee members.\n  As chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator Talent has been at \nthe forefront of the Committee's efforts to strengthen the Navy's \nshipbuilding program, working closely with the Chief of Naval \nOperations in the formation of the CNO's plan for a 313-ship Navy. He \nshowed steadfast determination in working with the administration and \nthe Congress to secure the funding required to build the future Navy; \nspearheading the effort to raise the top-line for shipbuilding by over \n20 percent during the course of his tenure as Seapower Chairman.\n  Senator Talent has also been passionate in his support for the needs \nof our brave men and women in uniform; championing quality-of-life and \nquality-of-service initiatives. Most notably, he has been a strong \nadvocate for legislation that will put an end to predatory lending \npractices against military personnel and their families.\n  Senator Dayton was elected to the Senate in 2000, and throughout his \nyears in the Senate I have had the privilege of serving with him on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. As a hard-working member of that \nCommittee, Mark was a strong advocate for our armed forces. Notably, he \nwas a strong supporter of increasing the death benefit gratuity for \nsurvivors of deceased members of the Armed Forces from a little more \nthan $12,000 to $100,000. Thanks in part to his efforts, this increased \ndeath benefit gratuity is now law.\n  Senator Dayton also reached across the aisle and worked closely with \nme in support of efforts to provide Medicare beneficiaries with a \nprescription drug benefit. Together, we introduced legislation to \nprovide America's seniors with a refundable tax credit to help off-set \nthe costs of prescription drugs.\n  In conclusion, over the years I have served with each of these 10 \nSenators, each has not only been a trusted colleague, each has also \nbeen my friend. I will miss serving with each of them in the Senate but \nknow that each will continue in public service in some capacity. I wish \neach and every one of them well in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I see a number of colleagues here anxious to speak, \nand I have taken generously of the time the Presiding Officer has \nallowed me to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am mindful that the majority \nleader will be coming here in approximately 6 minutes to speak, and I \nam looking forward to his comments.\n  Mr. President, I want to say that one of the great delights of being \na part of the Senate is to sit at the knee of such great leaders, such \nas the senior Senator from Virginia, and to learn from him and to hear \nthe stories that so often he can weave into any circumstance that is \nfacing us, that has some application of a story he had encountered in \nthe past. I thank him for his leadership. I thank him for his \ncontribution. And I thank him for being a mentor to so many of us in \nthis Senate.\n\n\n                    Water Resources Development Act\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, in the remaining moments here, \nI want to say one of the things this Senator will address in the next \nCongress is the fact that we did not pass a Water Resources Development \nAct, which has so many important projects for this Nation. We have not \nhad a Water Resources Development Act bill since 2000, and we are \nsuffering for it.\n  As to this great ecological restoration project down in my State, the \nFlorida Everglades Restoration Project, there are two critical projects \nin this WRDA bill--the Indian River Lagoon and the Picayune Strand. The \nIndian River Lagoon is a 156-mile-long estuary that I grew up on as a \nboy. It runs from basically just north of Cape Canaveral all the way \nsouth to Palm Beach County. It has been altered by unnaturally large \nand poorly timed freshwater discharges arising out of the St. Lucie \nCanal. They have altered the water quality and depleted the water \nsupplies in the Everglades ecosystem. So that is one project that is \ngoing to be necessarily addressed in the new Congress. There are many \ncomponents to that project. The Everglades restoration is an $8 billion \nproject over 20 years, shared by the Federal and the State governments.\n  The other major project--I will close with this--is the Picayune \nStrand restoration project. It is going to remove roads and canals and \nother infrastructure to increase freshwater flows. It encompasses 94 \nsquare miles in Collier\n\n[[Page S11429]]\n\nCounty, FL, and it includes such things as the Florida Panther National \nWildlife Refuge, the 10,000 Islands National Wildlife Refuge, and many \nothers.\n  These ecosystem protections and alterations are absolutely necessary \nfor the future of keeping this beautiful planet Earth and protecting \nthis very fragile ecosystem.\n\n\n                           Building Consensus\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank my colleagues for allowing me the \ntime. As we are awaiting the majority leader to arrive, I might say \nthat since many Senators are here, I want them to know what a great \nprivilege it has been for this Senator to serve with each of you and to \nserve in a bipartisan way.\n  One of the messages of this election I have just come through is that \npeople do not want this partisan bickering they have seen. They want us \nto come together, to build consensus, to perform, and to do it in a \nbipartisan way. This Senator is dedicated to doing that from now on.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11429-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11429-S11442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, about 2 months ago, late Sunday afternoon, \nwhen no one was around, I came into this Chamber to carry out a time-\nhonored tradition, nearly as old as the institution itself. I came over \nto this desk and I opened the drawer and the tradition of carving your \ninitials or your name into the bottom of that drawer was carried out. \nAs you open these drawers, as many of us do when we are sitting here \nlistening and debating, you tend to look at the names that are there. I \nsee Robert Taft at the bottom of this drawer, Hugh Scott, Everett \nDirksen, Howard Baker, Bob Dole, Trent Lott, and the list goes on. And \nwith the quiet here, you begin to reflect a little bit. But then all of \na sudden you start thinking, as you are carving your name into that \ndrawer, that there aren't very many things that you leave that are \npermanent around here, but that is one.\n  It confronted me, as it hits me with such force today, that our time \nhere, indeed, is temporary, and that we are here to occupy these seats \nat these desks just for a period of time. We can never forget that we \ndon't own these seats. We don't own our presence in this U.S. Senate. \nIt is with that recognition that I address my colleagues today.\n  I have reflected a lot over the last several weeks, and I think back \nto that nonpolitician who came to this city, this body, 12 years ago \nwith a whole lot of hope for the people of Tennessee and a whole lot of \nhope for this country. I think back to the people who put their trust \nin that man's hands.\n  Indeed, it was 12 years ago that Karyn and I came to Washington. I \ncame as a citizen legislator with absolutely no, no political \nexperience. I was a doctor. I spent 20 years in the profession of \nhealing. In my acceptance speech back 12 years ago, I pledged at that \ntime to my fellow Tennesseans that Karyn and I would go to Washington, \nthat we would serve for 12 years, for a limited amount of time, and \nthat we would go back to Tennessee and live under the laws that we \nhelped enact. And that is exactly what we will do. We are going to go \nback to Tennessee in a few weeks, and I am going to live in the very \nsame house that I was born in 54 years ago.\n  I still remember coming to the Hill early on, and I know a number of \nnew colleagues are coming to the Hill. I think back, and my former \nchief of staff, who was very green at the time--I just told you how \ngreen I was at the time--I remember standing right in front of the \nCapitol, and we had to stop somebody and ask: Where is this building \ncalled the Russell Building? And they told us. Luckily, I don't think \nthey knew who I was at the time.\n  But I did come believing deeply in the promise that I had made. I \nbelieved in my heart that with determination--and I had seen it in \nsurgery and in the operating room--one can make a difference in this \nworld. Today, I look back and I see that I was only half right. One \nperson can make a difference, and each of us do in our own ways. But to \nmake a difference, we can't do it alone.\n  I certainly couldn't have done it without people who stood both \nbehind me and with me over the last 12 years. I agree with all of my \ncolleagues. I know they know Karyn. And, indeed, she has honored me by \nher unwavering love each step along the way. Her grace in carrying out \nher official responsibilities, her commitment to the development of \ncharacter in our three boys, her moral support, her spiritual support \nfor me and our family, she has been that guiding river that has kept us \non course as we traveled two very different professions occupations: \nthat of being a heart surgeon and that of serving as a U.S. Senator.\n  Our three boys most of you know as well. You have watched them grow \nup over the last 12 years: Bryan, Jonathan, and Harrison. Obviously, we \nare so proud of each of them. I will speak directly to them because \nthey, as with anybody growing up, faced the huge challenges of growing \nup in public life, taking in stride the various swipes that the media \ntakes from time to time, but doing so with real dignity and strength. \nThe boys know that Tennessee is home. They have been able to take in \nthe rich texture that is afforded all of us as we raise children here \nin this town. And they have grown from three young boys when we came \nhere to three young men.\n  I want to thank staff members, and we never do that enough, those \nstaff members who have been with me from the very beginning: Emily \nReynolds, Ramona Lessen, Bart VerHulst, Cornell Wedge, Mark Winslow, \nand Carol Burroughs. I thank my series of chiefs of staff: Mark Tipps, \nLee Rawls, Howard Liebengood, Eric Ueland, Andrea Becker, Bart, and \nEmily, and all those who have come in and out of these doors since that \nvery first day 12 years ago when, yes, I, like somebody every cycle, \nwas 100th in seniority. It is the staff that puts the needs of this \ncountry before their own needs. And with a lot of hard work and a lot \nof passion and a lot of hope, they have accomplished so much.\n  A few moments always stand out in my mind, and I will not recite all \nof them, but a few do stand out in my mind, victories like the $15 \nbillion in funding for global HIV/AIDS, which I have seen firsthand the \npower in the hundreds of thousands and, indeed, I would say millions of \nlives that have been saved by American leadership there; the \nprescription drugs for seniors; confirming John Roberts and Sam Alito.\n\n  And through all of this time, we have borne witness to days that have \nliterally changed the face of this Nation and the face of this Capitol, \nthings like the Capitol shootings,\n  September 11, anthrax and ricin, and Katrina. But through all of \nthat, we kept it the best way we could, with hard work and a lot of \nhope.\n  I thank my colleagues who placed their faith in me to serve as their \nleader. As I said four Decembers ago, when you elected me, it was and \nhas been ever since, every day, a very humbling experience. On that day \n4 years ago I quoted Proverbs: In his heart a man plans his course, but \nthe Lord determines his steps.\n  And what fulfilling steps have been afforded me as leader. I cannot \nlet today pass without expressing gratitude for the close friendships \nof people who are here and some people who have passed through this \nChamber: Howard Baker, the great Republican leader from Tennessee whose \nshoes as majority leader I have done my best to fill. He has counseled \nme over the years both as a Senator and as leader. His sage advice I \nhave relied upon many times in those capacities.\n  You have to be very careful going around a room, but behind me, \npeople like Pete Domenici, who became a mentor to me on that very first \nday in 1995; and people like John Warner, whom we saw in action just a \nfew minutes ago on the floor and, yes, on the Gates nomination; and \nformer Senators, people like Don Nickles who so wisely set the stage \nfor the Republican tax cuts of the last several years; my colleague and \nconfidante, Mitch McConnell, whose wisdom and service\n\n[[Page S11430]]\n\nhas been indispensable to leading the Republican majority, who ascends \nin party leadership, who will be sitting at this desk in a few weeks, a \ntemperament and skill with which no one is better prepared; my \nTennessee colleagues, Fred Thompson and now Lamar Alexander, two great \nstatesmen with whom I have had the honor to work side by side as we \nhave addressed the needs of our constituents.\n  I thank the two Democratic leaders, Tom Daschle and now Harry Reid. \nAs Harry and I have said publicly many times, everybody sees the public \ncontrast between one leader to the other, between Harry and me. But \nwhat people don't see are the daily conversations, the private \nconversations off the floor where views are mutually respected, where \nburdens are shared, and where family is discussed. Karyn and I leave \nthis body with tremendous respect for Harry and for Landra, for their \ncontributions to this country.\n  To all my colleagues who have reached across the aisle and across \ndifferences when you could, thank you.\n  Twelve years ago, it was people in Tennessee who took a big chance, \nwho took a great chance. They took a chance on a doctor who was little \nknown, who had never served in public office, obviously had never run \nfor public office. They began by opening their minds and then opening \ntheir homes and then opening their lives and then opening their hearts. \nAnd I am eternally grateful to them for giving me that trust and taking \nthat chance.\n  On this floor many times I have mentioned my parents and I mentioned \nmy dad. Dad used to say: It is a powerful thing to know where you are \ngoing in life, but it is equally powerful to know where you have come \nfrom.\n  To the good people of Tennessee, I thank you for never letting me \nforget where I have come from. You never let me forget those promises \nmade on the trail over a decade ago, the promises that have been the \nheart of everything that we have done. Yours are the voices that have \ncalled out to me from Mountain City in east Tennessee to Memphis in the \nwest, the people out there who are working hard every day to raise a \nfamily, to grow a business, to run a farm, to get ahead. As long as I \nlive, I will never forget those voices. Those voices are clear, those \nvoices of common sense that called out and counseled me time and time \nagain.\n  Two people who won't hear me thank them today are two who were at my \nswearing in but who have since passed on: my parents Dorothy and Tommy \nFrist. They have left a fascinating legacy that the five children--I am \nthe last of those five--have been the beneficiaries of, a legacy of \nhonesty, of civility, of fairness, of hard work, and of service. And we \nall--at least I try to--struggle to capture what they did in passing \nthat legacy on to our children.\n  My own brothers and sisters, Mary, Bobby, Dottie, and Tommy, all in \ntheir own way, with their children and grandchildren, have been \nsuccessful in living lives of service to others. Many friends are here \ntoday, including Jean Ann and Barry Banker and Denise and Steve Smith. \nIt is that friendship, that team, that gives people, I believe, the \nstrength and foundation to carry out that mission of serving this great \ncountry.\n  In the past few weeks, I have spent a lot of time reflecting about \nthe future of this institution. As I prepared to leave here and return \nto my home, many people have asked, don't you ever regret the promise \nthat you made to serve just for 12 years, two terms? Did you regret it \nwhen you became chair of the RNC or majority leader? If you knew then \nwhat you know today, would you have made that promise 12 years ago? My \nanswer is yes, because I believe today, as I believed then, in the \nideal. It is, I guess, that ideal of a citizen legislator. It might \nseem bittersweet today, but it is right.\n  I hope that in some way, as I leave here, that my service--people may \nsay it was effective or ineffective, and that is all very important--is \nan example of someone who had never, ever run for public office, never \nserved before, and who had spent his lifetime--in fact, twice as much \ntime as I spent in the Senate--pursuing another profession, coming here \nlike so many people today and starting at 100th in seniority over in \nthe basement of the Dirksen and rising to majority leader over that 12-\nyear period; an example of a committed doctor who is able to find \npurpose and fulfillment in serving others, as all of us do as Senators, \nthrough elected office. I hope that will inspire others to seek office \nand to do public service. It is my hope that those who come to serve \nafter me as a true citizen legislator will bring perspective and new \nideas in a small way, a serendipitous way, or maybe a large way, and \nmake this country a little better and contribute to this institution.\n  You have heard me talk about, and champion at times, term limits. \nMost people don't like them. They were popular for a period of time. I \nam a great believer in self-imposed term limits. Every morning you get \nup, you say I have 3 more years, 2 more years, or 1 year, or a half \nyear, or 10 days, and you know that as every day goes by. If you don't \nhave an understanding that there can be an end, you tend to forget \nthat. Self-imposed term limits are the extreme exception here today, \nnot the practice of this city. I think as a consequence we are moving \ntoward a body that has too much of a 2-year vision, governing for that \nnext election, rather than a body with a 20-year vision governing for \nthe future.\n  As we consider the future of the institution, I urge that we ask \nourselves what it is our forefathers envisioned. Is today's reality \nwhat they foresaw? I urge that we consider our work in this Chamber. \nWhat is it all about? Is it about keeping the majority? Is it about red \nStates versus blue States? Is it about lobbing attacks across the aisle \nor is it about war rooms whose purpose is not to contrast ideas but to \ndestroy or is it more? When the Constitutional Convention met in 1787, \ndelegates considered how best to structure this legislative branch of \nnew Government. They were determined not to repeat the mistakes made in \nthe Articles of Confederation, which had a single, unicameral \nlegislature. Speaking to the convention, Virginia's James Madison set \nforth the reasons to have a Senate. His words:\n\n       In order to judge the form to be given to this institution, \n     it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by \n     it.\n\n  These were, first, to protect the people against their rulers and, \nsecondly, to protect the people against transient impressions into \nwhich they themselves might be led.\n  I think we need to remember this vision of the Senate that the \nFramers established--that the Senate is to protect people from their \nrulers and as a check on the House and on the passions of the \nelectorate. Let us not allow these passions of the electorate to be \nreflected as destructive partisanship on this floor.\n  Taking the oath of office, which many of our good colleagues will be \ndoing shortly, commits each Senator to respect and revere the Framers' \ndream. To my successor, Bob Corker, and to all the Senators who will \nfollow me in service to this great Nation, I urge you to be bold, make \nthe most of your time here, and look at problems with fresh eyes and \nthe steely determination to give the American people a reason to \nbelieve in you and to hope for a better tomorrow.\n  To serve in this grand institution has been a labor of love. To lead \nhere is a challenging responsibility that is set out before me and each \nof us. It has been a profound honor to serve.\n  I will close with just one story. It happens in southern Sudan. As \nmany of you have heard me say, because it is such an important part of \nmy life, I go to Sudan just about every year--a thousand miles south of \nKhartoum and 500 miles west of the Nile River. I started going there in \nthe mid to late nineties. I had been there operating back in the bush, \nand I was ready to come home. Actually, it was in January. The State of \nthe Union was a few days off. We finished operating in a hut. I \noperated by flashlight late at night. Somebody in a little hut said, \n``I want to see the American doctor.'' Well, I didn't want to go. I \nwanted to get back home. I wanted to get on the plane and come back \nhome, but I went to see him. I was tired. I walked over and pulled the \ncurtain aside--the rug that was used as a curtain--and in the back \nthere was somebody smiling. You could see the bandages on his hands and \nlegs, and I went over; and through a translator I said, ``I am the \nAmerican doctor.'' He said, ``Thank you to the American doctor.'' As a \nphysician, I am accustomed to that because when you\n\n[[Page S11431]]\n\noperate on somebody, they say thank you. So I said, ``you're welcome,'' \nand I got ready to leave. He was frustrated and he said, ``Come back.'' \nHe said. ``Thank you for being the American doctor.'' I still didn't \nquite get it. He picked up his arm and said, ``I lost my arm fighting \nin this civil war. I lost my leg 8 days ago. It was about 2 years ago \nthat I lost my wife and my 2 children. Thank you for being the American \ndoctor.''\n\n  And then I started to get it. He was saying thank you for being the \nAmerican doctor. Then he said, basically, that: It is you who are a \nrepresentative of America, and for democracy and liberty and freedom I \nsacrificed my wife and my children and my arm and my body. Thank you \nfor what you represent.\n  Then all of a sudden, it began to hit me. To me, that image cuts \nthrough just about everything that we do. It is about preserving as \nbest we can the great hope that we represent here in America, which is \nembodied in this institution, the freedom, the responsibility, the \nopportunity, the compassion, and the basic decency that is at the heart \nof who we are as Americans. Beyond Democrat or Republican--which came \nout of the campaign--now is the time to again remind ourselves and \nstate again and again that beyond being Democrats and Republicans, we \nare Americans. Together, we are one people. It is our responsibility to \nuphold the dream and protect that hope for every American and indeed \nthe people around the world who seek that freedom.\n  I opened by saying that our time here is temporary; we are just \npassing through. Now is the time to close. Your patience has been \ngenerous. As I have spent a lifetime learning, to everything there is a \nseason. We say that and hear it and tend to repeat it when there are \nchanges. But to everything there is a season, and my season here draws \nto a close. Tomorrow is the time for birth and rebirth. Tomorrow is a \nday and a time for new rhythms.\n  My dad did a great thing that I shared with some of you. Each of us \nshould do this for our children or for the people we care about. He \nknew he was going to die in the next couple of years. We asked him to \nwrite down his thoughts, advice, and counsel for the next generation--\nnot just his kids and theirs, but for the great-great-grandkids that he \nwould never see, a simple 4 to 5 pages. He ended that letter to his \ngreat-grandchildren with the following words:\n\n       The world is always changing, and that's a good thing. It's \n     how you carry yourself in the world that doesn't change--\n     morality, integrity, warmth, and kindness are the same things \n     in 1910, when I was born, or in 2010, or later, when you will \n     be reading this. And that's a good thing, too. Love, \n     Granddaddy.\n\n  So under the dome, it is time for fresh faces and fresh resolve. \nChange is good. Change is constructive. The Senate changes, the people \nwho serve here change; but what doesn't change is that every one of us \nwho serves believes deeply in the genius of the American democracy.\n  It is with the deepest appreciation that Karyn and I thank you all \nfor 12 wonderful years. There are no words to describe the honor it has \nbeen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parting really is sweet sorrow. Mr. \nPresident, thank you very much for being here today honoring not only \nSenator Frist, our majority leader, but the entire Senate.\n  On the surface, some may ask how the Senate and the operating room \nare the same. What do they have in common? Senator Frist has shown us \nthat helping people is what he did as a doctor and what he has done as \na Senator. Serving others is a trait as we have observed by knowing \nthis good man is that he learned from his family. His father was also a \ndoctor. As a young man he was obviously academically very talented. He \nwanted to follow in his father's footsteps. He went to Princeton \nUniversity, which shows that he is someone who is talented academically \nand socially. He graduated from that great American learning \ninstitution and decided he was going to go to Harvard, which speaks \nwell, again, of his intellect and, of course, his ability to get along \nwith people. His surgical training came at Massachusetts General \nHospital and Southhampton General Hospital in England.\n  Senator Frist was a pioneer, but he learned his transplant surgery \nfrom the pioneer. I have heard Bill Frist talk about Norman Shumway on \nmany occasions--the first doctor to perform a successful heart \ntransplant in the U.S. Senator Frist--then Dr. Frist--started \nVanderbilt University Medical Center's Heart and Lung Transplant \nCenter. I don't know if anybody knows--I am sure someone knows--how \nmany heart and lung transplants Senator Frist has done, but most say it \nwas nearly 200. Think about that. Some of these operations took many \nhours, and some of them took days.\n  I heard Dr. Frist talk about those first transplants, where he \nactually went and got the organs and personally brought them back to \nthe operating room.\n  Things have changed since then. Pioneer, doctor, Senator Frist has \nand will write a lot about his success as a surgeon and as a Senator. \nAnd not only will he talk with his family and his friends about this, \nthings will be written about his service as a doctor and as a Senator.\n  When we talk about these nearly 200 transplants, we are talking about \n200 human beings whose lives have been saved by virtue of his talent. \nSenator Frist helped hundreds of people continue their lives. Here, as \na public servant, a Senator, he has affected the lives of millions of \npeople.\n  I have had the good fortune of serving with Senator Frist during his \n12 years in the Senate. I knew him before I became the Democratic \nleader and, as all of you know, I spend a lot of time on the floor and \nI worked with him very closely.\n  Over the years, we have had our ups and downs. It has been tough. \nThese jobs, I can tell my colleagues up close, are not real easy. We \nhave had problems over budgets, over committee structure, disagreements \nabout schedules--oh, yes, about Senate rules. I have never once \ndoubted--never once doubted--that what Senator Frist was doing he was \ndoing because he believed in his heart it was the right thing. That is \nwhy I, Harry Reid, at his home on a very personal level, told Senator \nFrist he should run for reelection. I don't believe in term limits. I \ntruly believed then, as I do now, that he should have run for \nreelection. I told his good wife Karyn the same thing in her home, in \ntheir home.\n  I have come to learn a number of things about Bill Frist. He loves \nmedicine. He has done his work in the Senate. But the thing that is \nfirst and paramount in his mind and his heart every minute of the day \nis Karyn and his three boys.\n  All of you out here have seen our fights publicly, and we have had \nthem, but they have been fair. I can remember only once has Senator \nFrist ever raised his voice at me, and it was right from here because, \neven though I didn't mean to, he thought I had said something that \nreflected upon his family, and I apologized to him. This man loves his \nfamily and is an example of how people should treat their family.\n  Karyn is a wonderful woman. She has treated my wife--my wife is a \nvery shy person. She has always been very shy. Karyn has taken good \ncare of her, and I will always, Karyn, appreciate that.\n  In the years that go on, I, frankly, will never think about or, if I \ntry, not remember any of the differences we had on the Senate floor, \nbut I will always remember the friendship I have developed with the \ngood man from Tennessee, a citizen legislator.\n  Senator Frist, Karyn, I wish you the very best. You are a good man. I \nlove and appreciate everything you have done for the country and for \nme.\n  (Applause.)\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, on behalf of all the Members on this \nside of the aisle--and Senator Reid acknowledged the same as well--am \ngrateful for your presence here today. Being here today to help honor \nour outgoing majority leader, I know, means a lot to him. It means a \nlot to all the rest of us.\n  Rare is the person who rises to the top of one profession, not to \nmention two. We are honoring today a man who has done that--he has \nrisen to the very top of not one but two extraordinarily difficult \nprofessions. And I am absolutely certain, as all of his colleagues are, \nthat he will excel in whatever challenge he takes on next.\n\n[[Page S11432]]\n\n   Bill Frist embodies what our Founding Fathers meant when they spoke \nof ``citizen legislators.'' By his early forties, he had already risen \nto prominence as a renowned heart and lung surgeon. But Bill felt a \ncall to public service. After achieving enormous success in that field, \nhe came to us in the Senate and rose to the top here as well. He had \nnot sought the leader's office, but in some ways it could be argued \nthat it sought him and, once again, he was top in his field.\n  After 4 years, Bill has been an effective and courageous leader. I \nhave been here for a pretty long time now, Mr. President, and I can \nhonestly say that the last 4 years have been some of the most \nproductive years in the Senate that I have seen.\n  Under Bill Frist's leadership, we have made the lives of people \nacross America better and safer. More opportunity lies ahead for \ntoday's children than ever before. Most of all, Bill has never relented \nin leading this Senate to fight the war on terror. America is more \nsecure thanks to his tenacity and thanks to his talents.\n  Bill is leaving us, as we all know, sticking to his promise to the \nvoters of Tennessee to serve only two terms. Legend holds that \nCincinnatus, the Roman farmer, became ruler of Rome at the behest of \nhis fellow citizens. But after leading them to victory against \ninvaders, he gave up the mantle of power and returned to his farm.\n  Whether Bill returns to medicine or continues to serve the public in \nsome other way, we can be sure of this: He will continue to be one of \nAmerica's great leaders. And if he does return to public office, it \nwill be because he was asked by his fellow citizens to serve and to \nlead.\n  Words such as ``sacrifice,'' ``duty,'' and ``service'' mean something \nto Bill Frist. This Senate and this country are the better for it.\n  It has been a joy to know Bill's lovely family--his wife, Karyn, and \nhis three sons, Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan. They are all proud of \ntheir father and husband.\n  I am going to miss you, Bill. It has been a great honor working with \nyou every day over the last 4 years, and it will be an honor to take \nthe baton from Bill to lead Senate Republicans during the 110th \nCongress.\n  Just as Kentucky and Tennessee share a border 320 miles long, Bill \nand I share a bond as Senators, party leaders, and, yes, as friends. I \ncan see that all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle feel the \nsame way I do. It is sad to see you leave. You have done a magnificent \njob. People come and go in the Senate over the years and, candidly, I \nguess some of them didn't make a whole lot of difference. But you did, \nand you will be remembered with great pride by all of us. Thank you for \nyour service.\n\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join in this chorus of salutations and \npraise for the retiring majority leader. I listened carefully to \nSenator Frist's recollection of his public service, and I noted the \nfirst item on his agenda was the $15 billion in the fight against \nglobal AIDS. It is an issue on which we joined together many times, an \nissue where President Bush showed extraordinary leadership, and there \nwas extraordinary bipartisan support for what he was trying to achieve.\n  As one reflects on his life and his background, it was no surprise \nthat led the list. Senator Frist dedicated his time before the Senate \nto the healing arts, and I think he brought some of that same \ndedication to this role in the Senate, trying to use his post as the \nSenator from Tennessee and as a leader in the Senate to heal the world \nand our Nation. I thank you for all your efforts in that regard.\n  I know when he came to this job, it was thrust upon him rather \nquickly. I know he had his critics, and there might even have been a \nfew on this side of the aisle from time to time, but, by and large, I \nthink his leadership has been symbolized by a lack of cunning, a lack \nof sharp elbows and an effort to try and patch up our differences and \nget things done. Once again, you were the healer when you had the \nchance to do it.\n  I have traveled to Africa, as he has, probably not as often. I have \nseen some of those dusty villages where there is no one to be seen for \nmiles around. But I cannot imagine your taking your surgical skills to \nthose villages and those huts and operating under a flashlight, hour \nafter hour, day after day, week after week. That defines Bill Frist, in \nmy mind--a person who may not have been recognized by anyone on the \nroad to that village, did some good, and left a legacy that will be \nremembered.\n  To you, to Karyn, to your family, let me add my voice in saying you \nleft a great legacy in the Senate, and I wish you all the very best.\n  (Applause.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, former Senator Lyndon Johnson used to \nsay about himself that having Lyndon Johnson as majority leader was \ngood for the United States of America and it hasn't hurt Texas one bit.\n  When I think of our country and Bill Frist, I think of lower tax \nrates, I think of two Supreme Court Justices, I think of a record \nnumber of judges who would interpret the law, rather than make it up as \nthey go along. I think of the personal imprint of Senator Frist on the \nprescription drug Medicare benefit millions of Americans need and are \nenjoying, and I think of the $15 billion generous gesture of this \ncountry toward Africa to combat HIV/AIDS, which would not have happened \nwere it not for Bill Frist.\n  When I think of Bill Frist and Tennessee, I think of our new TVA \nboard to keep our rates low and reliable. I think of our ability to \ndeduct our sales tax from Federal income tax and dozens and dozens of \nother things that have been good for Tennessee.\n  When I think of Bill Frist, I think of civility, of decency, a good \nsmile, hard work, and an ego that is surprisingly under control for a \nSenator in the midst of all of this and an example of which his parents \nwould be proud. So I think we can say today, and Lyndon Johnson \nwouldn't mind, that having Bill Frist as majority leader of the U.S. \nSenate has been good for our country and it hasn't hurt Tennessee one \nbit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my friends and colleagues in \npaying tribute to a friend and a distinguished colleague. When Bill \nFrist arrived here, there were at least some of us with some qualms on \nthis side of the aisle because he ran successfully against one of our \ndear friends, Jim Sasser. So, initially, there was a natural reluctance \namong some of us about this doctor who had defeated a great friend and \na great Senator.\n  But early on, it was clear that Bill was special. As someone who had \nbeen trained in the medicine, in my own State of Massachusetts no less, \nhe brought a new and fresh perspective to our national debates.\n  He was obviously a person of impressive skill, and it is no surprise \nthat he rose so quickly to become majority leader. The roles of \nSenators and physicians are profoundly different in many ways, but at \ntheir core their missions are identical to help others to the maximum \nextent of our ability. And that is what Bill Frist has done from the \nday he set foot in this chamber.\n  He was one of the first to understand the very real threat of \nbioterrorism to our Nation, and that was well before 9/11 or the \nanthrax attacks. Senator Frist knew first-hand that our public health \ninfrastructure was incapable of meeting the threat of a massive natural \nepidemic, let alone a deliberate biological attack. It was a privilege \nto work with him on the first bio-terrorism legislation, which because \nof his leadership we were able to pass before 9/11.\n  He has also been a pioneer in the effort to bring modern information \ntechnology into all aspects of health care, and to end the enormous \nhuman and financial costs caused by medical errors and by the needless \nadministration of health care with outdated paper records. He has also \nhelped shine a bright line on the serious problem of health disparities \nin our country.\n  He has inspired each of us with his commitment to addressing the \nhorrific tragedy still unfolding in the world, especially in Africa, \nbecause of AIDS. He has dedicated himself to this issue for years, \ngiving of himself personally, and urging Congress to act more \nexpeditiously. He made time to continue this\n\n[[Page S11433]]\n\nmissions of mercy, even after he became majority leader, and I was \ndeeply touched by it every time.\n  I have had the good opportunity to meet his family, and I know, as \nothers have said, where his values come from and how committed he is to \nthem. I hope he'll be able to enjoy more time with them now without the \nburden of running the Senate.\n  We wish Bill Frist the best as he prepares to leave the Senate. We \nknow he will have great success, and we thank him for his service to \nour country. We will miss the majority leader, but we know he will \ncontinue to use his immense talent to make a very real difference for \nall humanity in the years ahead, and continue to make us proud to call \nhim our friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words before the \nleader left. I even hate to call him leader or majority leader. He has \nbecome a great friend. I don't know how to explain it, but I didn't \nreally think coming to the Senate that I would have a chance to meet \nsomebody like our good departing leader. I have met all kinds of people \nhere. Henry Bellman once said: If you sit down with all 100 of them, no \nmatter what you have said about criticizing them, there are no better \n100 men put together in America than the 100 Senators who serve. I \nbelieve that is true. I am wondering now about whether the Senator \nwouldn't rival military leadership.\n  But the point is, I didn't think Bill--I know we can't do that in the \nSenate, use first names--but I didn't think I would ever meet in the \nBudget Committee of the U.S. Senate--sitting in the very last seat \navailable was this man whose name is so simple, but I had so much \ntrouble with it. Do you remember? I didn't say ``Frist,'' I kept saying \n``First.'' I don't know why, but I did that for a long time, and then \nit became sort of a--people would come up and punch me so I would say \nit right. But whether it is ``Frist'' or ``First,'' I guess they mean \nabout the same thing to me. You are truly first.\n  What we have gone through personally will not be reflected in the \nRecord. People know I have had a few years of illness. It is mostly \ngone now. But I found out he was a superb doctor, and eventually I \nfound out there weren't too many better anywhere. That made it easy \nbecause I had a ready-made doctor and he was the best. And we would \nmeet in his office, and people would think it was always business, but \nthey had no idea that it was half business, a little bit family--we got \nto know each other's families, and what a terrific and exciting thing \nthat was for me--and I got to know about his excellence as a doctor.\n  It will be a different Senate, there is no question.\n  You have been dealt some cards that are not right. The years you were \nhere, the things that were accomplished were not quite presented to the \npeople as accomplishments or as big accomplishments, as they are. But \nif there is anybody interested in searching the Record during his term \nand during his leadership period to see what he accomplished, I believe \nyou will have to end up saying there was nobody during his time here \nwho accomplished more for his State and for the country. I believe an \nin-depth search of what he has done may even rival the best, even \nthough he does not know how to legislate, and there is no question \nabout that, and he does not know how to appropriate, and there is no \nquestion about that. He might not even know how to bring an \nappropriations bill up, and there might be no doubt about that. He may \ndoubt it, but this Senator doesn't, and I am his best friend, but I \nhave great doubts whether he knows how to get an appropriations bill up \nand passed.\n  But I still believe the business of the Senate is not done in those \nvery overt ways that people think. It is done as you sit down for long \nhours on a conference report and come out with a health bill that all \nof a sudden is better than anything we have had before. When you find \nout who did it, it might not have been named for the Senator or for the \nchairman of this or that, but you will find out that for many hours, \nmany trips were taken to his office, and many times, he said: Wait and \nwe will do it in the morning, and I will tell you how to do it. And \nthat happened.\n  I could go on for much longer, but I really wanted him to know that I \njust waited for my time. Being the fifth or sixth eldest here in \nseniority, I waited for my time here, and I didn't want to wait until \ntomorrow or the next day in fear that I would not find time or that the \nSenate would not accommodate. So I thought I would, as usual, be late \nfor a next appointment, but I have a good excuse for being late for \nthis next one.\n  I had to come here and say goodbye in a very interesting way, \nalthough it is not a goodbye. But I do think it is true that this will \nbe a very major change in our friendship, in the way we react to each \nother, and the time we get to spend with each other. So it is an \noccasion, this leaving of the Senate, because you won't come back very \noften. Even though you say you will, you won't, and we won't get to see \nyou. I really believe we will remember you, and probably we will call \nyou more times than you will call us because I think we may just from \ntime to time figure out more times than you will that we need some \nadvice, and it will probably run in your direction, not in ours, in the \nensuing years.\n  Good luck in whatever you do. It is not going to be this little \nreturn to being a country doctor, if that is what you are saying. You \ncan't sell me on that. You are not going to be a little country doctor; \nyou are not even going to be a regular doctor. You are going to do \nsomething much bigger than that. It is just waiting. Somebody is going \nto place it in front of you, and then you will do it and it will be \nsomething big and exciting for America and for our people, probably \nmore exciting than you did here, so that will be a third one--one, the \nheart transplants and all that, one here with us, and then you will \nhave a third one. In the meantime, you can do a lot of duck hunting, no \nproblem with that. You can probably go with me, if you want. But if you \nshoot too well, I won't bring you anymore because it is embarrassing. \nIt has to be sort of a modest hunt, not so superb that I am \nembarrassed. So we will have to work that out some way. And your son--\nhe can't come anymore because he shoots too well. It is truly not the \nright thing to do. He should not be hunting with an old man like me. No \nway. But if it happens, we will accommodate it some way.\n  Having said all that I should and much more, I will say goodbye and \nthank you.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cornyn). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                               Jim Talent\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise on the floor to pay tribute to my \nvery good friend and colleague, Senator Jim Talent, who will be leaving \nthe Senate next month.\n  I have known Jim for over 20 years, since he was minority leader in \nthe Missouri House of Representatives. Throughout all these years, when \nhe was in the State legislature and in the House as chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee when I was chairman of the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, I found Jim to be unfailingly a man of honesty, \nintegrity, and hard work. He has been a wonderful friend and colleague.\n  I am going to miss him very much, and many people in Missouri are.\n  We all know that Washington can change a person, but it hasn't \nchanged Jim. Jim still has the same commonsense Missouri values he \nbrought with him to Washington. He still has the same calm, polite \ndemeanor. He still has strong convictions and a work ethic. As I said \nto our folks back home in Missouri, in an arena of show horses he has \nbeen a work horse.\n  I was with him on the night he got the news that he lost the \ncampaign. He was a man of unfailingly good humor and courage. And \nstill, he thanked his Lord, his friends, and graciously accepted his \nfate.\n  I have a feeling and hope that public service will see much more of \nJim Talent somewhere, sometime. And whatever he decides to do in the \npublic or in the private sector, the qualities he has\n\n[[Page S11434]]\n\ndemonstrated to so many of us in the Senate will be one he will carry \nwith him.\n  He served in the Senate for only 4 years, but when you look at his \nrecord of legislative achievements, he has had so many positive impacts \non people's lives. It is hard to believe he could cram all of that into \n4 years.\n  He has been a leader on national security, energy, and criminal \njustice.\n  As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Jim worked to \nextend production of the C-17 line, allowing 30,000 workers across the \ncountry to keep their jobs, and more importantly to give our military \nstrategic lift capability which they need to move troops and equipment \nto very difficult to reach places.\n  Jim also cares about our troops in battle. He sponsored legislation \nto end predatory lending to active servicemembers and their families. \nThe new law just took effect 6 weeks ago. Some of our soldiers were \npaying almost 400 percent interest on money loaned to them. Thanks to \nJim Talent, the rates are now capped at 36 percent. I trust that \napplies to the Marines as well.\n  Last year, Jim worked very hard to include a renewable fuel provision \nin the Energy bill. On a bipartisan basis, under his leadership, the \nUnited States will produce up to 7\\1/2\\ billion gallons of renewable \nfuels with ethanol and biodiesel. That will be implemented by 2012.\n  Jim's work in this area will only become more important as we see in \nthe future America continuing to face high energy costs and our attempt \nto reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Another accomplishment Jim will be known for is something which is \nextremely important in our State of Missouri, and this work--again on a \nbipartisan basis with the Senator from California--was to fight meth. \nMeth is a drug that has been destroying lives and communities across \nour State for many years and now even across the country.\n  The Combat Meth Act has helped stop the supply of meth ingredients to \ndealers through the ban on over-the-counter sales. You see a \nsignificant reduction in meth lab busts. It shows that we are finally \nbeginning to make progress against this drug.\n  Obviously, I have to mention his other bipartisan successes, such as \nthe sickle cell disease bill and the Emmett Till bill.\n  On a narrow focus, Jim and I have worked together on many \ntransportation and economic development projects to serve our State of \nMissouri, including the Liberty Memorial in Kansas City, the Page \nAvenue Extension in St. Charles, and countless others throughout the \nState.\n  I should also mention that my friend Jim Talent has put forward some \nterrific proposals that he has been working on that have been enacted. \nHis effort to allow small business employers to pool together to form \nassociation health plans comes to mind, and those of us who have been \nworking to change the law so that small business employees and their \nfamilies will have access to the same kind of insurance benefits that \nemployees of major corporations have will not give up the fight. We are \ngoing to continue with his great leadership in mind.\n  I am sure the next Congress will follow up. This idea should be \ncentral to any discussion of expanding health care coverage to the \nuninsured.\n  Jim, as we prepare to say goodbye to you now from this floor, thank \nyou for your years of devoted service to our State, to our Nation. With \nheartfelt gratitude, on behalf of my wife Linda and I, we wish you, \nBrenda, and your children the very best in future endeavors. And I know \nfor a fact that there will be great successes ahead.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Appropriate Level of Military Funding\n\n  Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, my great friend and colleague from \nMissouri has an Intelligence Committee meeting to go to. So he went \nahead and did his kind tribute before I give my speech, and those who \nare not aware of that may have thought that maybe they would be able to \nget in short tributes and avoid the long farewell speech. That is not \ntrue.\n  I will devote my time to a substantive and very important subject--\nthe appropriate level of funding for America's military. It is an issue \nthat I have worked on and fought for since I went to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1993.\n  I am grateful for my friend's remarks, and I want to say that I have \nalways enjoyed serving in legislatures, in part because of the \ncollegial nature of the service. When you are done, yes--it is the \nlegislation that you worked on that you want people to remember, but \nwhat you remember are the friendships and the associations and the \nbonds that you have made. And, fortunately, those do not end with your \nservice. I look forward to continuing to visit with my friends in the \nSenate for years to come. I hope to be able to work with them in other \nvenues on issues of importance to America. Nothing is more important \nfor America than her security.\n  Mr. President, America has the most capable military in the world by \na large margin; in fact we have the best military that has ever served \nany nation at any time in human history. We should be proud of that; we \nshould especially be proud of the men and women who make America's \nmilitary what it is. But it would be wrong for us to believe that \nbecause our military is the best in the world or even the best ever, \nthat it is as capable as it needs to be. True, America is many times \nstronger than other nations, but its responsibilities are many times \ngreater as well. If Denmark's military is inadequate, it doesn't matter \nthat much, even to Denmark; if America's military is inadequate, it \nmatters tremendously, first to America, but also to the hopes and \naspirations of people throughout the world.\n  We must understand the importance of this issue very clearly, without \nthe distortions of ideology, politics, expediency, or wishful thinking. \nLike it or not, the progress of the international order towards peace \nand democracy depends on the reality and perception of American power. \nLike it or not, America is the first defender of freedom in the world \nand therefore always a prime target for those who hate freedom. And \nlike it or not, while there are many tools in the basket of western \ndiplomacy, the underpinning of them all is an American military \nestablishment which the world knows is capable of swiftly, effectively \nand at minimal cost defeating every substantial threat to our security \nand to our freedom.\n  Judged by this standard--the only appropriate standard--the situation \nis very grave. I have substantial doubt--as good as the men and women \nare--whether our current military establishment is strong enough. \nBecause of decisions over the last 15 years driven more by budgetary \nthan military considerations, our Army and Navy may well be too small, \nand much of the equipment in all the services is too old and \nincreasingly unreliable.\n  Whatever the current status of the military may be, there can be no \ndoubt that without a substantial increase in procurement spending \nbeginning now and sustained over the next 5 to 10 years--an increase, I \nsuggest to the Senate today, that must be measured not in billions but \nin tens of billions of dollars above current estimates every year--our \nmilitary will be set back for a generation. We will not be able to \nmodernize our forces to the degree necessary to preserve our security \nwith the necessary margin of safety.\n  I said that our current military is too small and inadequately \nequipped to execute the national military strategy. I will not go into \ndetail on this point because my main focus is on the future, but a \nbrief explanation is warranted. The world is, on balance, at least as \ndangerous today as it was at the end of the Cold War. And we may thank \nGod we are no longer in danger of a massive nuclear attack from the \nformer Soviet Union, nor is a major land war in Europe likely.\n  Against this, however, we are engaged in a global war on terror that \nwill continue for years to come. The end of the Cold War led to the \nemergence of dangerous regional conflicts, such as the conflicts in the \nBalkans. We are in greater danger today of a rogue missile attack than \never been before, and China is emerging as a peer competitor much \nfaster than anyone believed.\n  These conditions either did not exist, or like the conflicts in the \nformer Yugoslavia, were suppressed, during the Cold War. As a result, \nthe operational tempo of our conventional forces--and that means the \nrate, intensity and duration of their deployment--was far higher \nbeginning in the\n\n[[Page S11435]]\n\nmid-1990s, even before September 11, than it had ever been during the \nCold War. Yet at the beginning of the 1990s, our forces were 30 to 40 \npercent bigger than today. For example, the active-duty Army was cut \nfrom 18 divisions at the time of Desert Storm to only 10 divisions by \n1994. Don't we wish that we had those additional divisions today to \nrelieve the pressure in Iraq. The Navy has gone from 576 ships in the \nlate 1980s to 278 ships today.\n  At the same time, procurement budgets have been cut substantially, \nfar greater than the cuts in force structure warranted. The contrast in \nthe average annual procurement of major equipment from two periods--\n1975 to 1990 and from 1991 to 2000--is startling. For example, we \npurchased an average of 78 scout and attack helicopters each year from \n1975 to 1990, and only 7 each year from 1991 to 2000. We purchased an \naverage of 238 Air Force fighters each year from 1975 to 1990, and an \naverage of only 28 each year from 1991 to 2000. We purchased five \ntanker aircraft each year from 1975 to 1990, an average of only one per \nyear from 1991 to 2000.\n  The implications for these dramatic reductions are profound. Older \nplatforms--that is what the military calls ships, planes, and \nvehicles--are rather tired and not replaced, which means that force \nstructure is reduced. Military capabilities are reduced. If platforms \nare not replaced, the average age of the fleet increases, readiness \nlevels drop, and the cost of maintaining the smaller, older inventory \nclimbs rapidly because maintenance costs increase.\n  For these reasons, I suggest that the current force today is too \nsmall and its equipment too old, relative to the requirements of our \nnational military strategy. That strategy calls for a military capable \nof defending the homeland, sustaining four peacekeeping engagements, \nand fighting two large-scale regional conflicts, at least, at \napproximately the same time. We are supposed to be able to do all that \nat once. I believe the requirements of our military are actually \ngreater than this, but in any event, we cannot execute even these \ncommitments, and we certainly will not be able to do so in the future, \nwithin an acceptable level of risk, unless at least the Army is made \nbigger and unless all three services have the money to robustly \nrecapitalize their major platforms with the most modern equipment.\n  For years, the various services, in response to pressure from \npolitical authorities to reduce the budget below what they needed, have \ndelayed or cancelled new programs. They have been reducing the number \nof new ships or planes they say they need, kicking crucial decisions \ndown the budgetary road, robbing Peter to pay Paul, and otherwise \ntrying to avoid confronting the approaching funding crisis.\n  That crisis is upon us now. We are entering the crucial phase of \nrecapitalization. Beginning with the next budget and intensifying over \nthe next 5 to 10 years, the services are scheduled to bring online the \nnew platforms that will anchor American security for the next \ngeneration. No one can say these programs are unneeded. The Navy must \nbuy new destroyers, must ramp up procurement of Virginia-class \nsubmarines, must finalize the design and buy large numbers of Littoral \nCombat Ships and design and build a new CG-X cruiser.\n  The Air Force must buy large numbers of the F-22. That is our new \nair-superiority fighter. We must maintain the ability to have complete \nair superiority over any combat theater. The Air Force must buy large \nnumbers of Joint Strike Fighters or equivalent aircraft. In addition, \nthe Air Force must buy out its airlift requirement. That is how we \ntransport personnel, equipment and supplies from one place to another \nin the world. It must build a new generation of tankers, must design \nand build a long-range strike bomber to replace the B-52. Our B-52 \ninventory is 45 years old.\n  The Army must rebuild, modernize or replace almost its entire capital \nstock of ground combat and support vehicles including many of its \ntanks.\n  The current procurement budget for all three services is $80.9 \nbillion. Simple budgetary mathematics tells us that the services cannot \npossibly meet their crucial requirements without an average budget over \nthe next 5 to 10 years that I estimate is at least 30 billion dollars \nhigher than what we are now spending.\n\n  Perhaps I have gone into more detail than the Senate is willing to \nindulge me in already, but I want to look in some depth at the \nsituation of the Navy. Here I speak from what I know because I have \nbeen the chairman of the Subcommittee on Seapower for the last 4 years. \nCurrently, there are 278 ships in the U.S. Navy. The Navy shipbuilding \nplan calls for 326 ships by the year 2020, eventually settling down to \nan average of 313 ships. The plan actually calls for fewer aircraft \ncarriers, a substantial drop in attack submarines, and fewer major \nsurface combatants, but it attempts to make up for these reductions \nwith modern destroyers, more capable submarines and what it calls pre-\npositioning ships that allow us to establish sea bases, from which to \nproject forces ashore, as well as a whole new class of smaller multi-\nmission modular vessels called Littoral Combat Ships. There is no \nmargin whatever for error in this plan. It is, at best, the minimum \nnecessary for our security.\n  The Chief of Naval Operations--that is the admiral who leads the \nNavy--has estimated the plan will require a shipbuilding budget of \n$13.3 billion for fiscal year 2008, the upcoming budget year. That is \n$5 billion more than what was spent this year on ship building. His \nplan calls for that figure to escalate to $17.5 billion by 2012. I \nbelieve these figures are too conservative. It is a good-faith effort \nto calculate what we need but too conservative. I think the plan will \nrequire billions more each year to execute. Both the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Congressional Research Service agree. In any \nevent, I say on my oath as a Senator, that it will be utterly \nimpossible, at current levels of defense spending, for the Navy to \nreach and sustain the $13.3 billion figure, to say nothing of the even \nhigher sums required in the outyears of the 5-year defense plan and \nbeyond.\n  Beginning no later than 2009, there will be a growing shortfall in \nthe ship-building accounts, in addition to an annual shortfall of $1 \nbillion to $2 billion in Navy aviation procurement. I expect the total \ndeficiency to be no less than $45 billion over the fiscal year 2008 to \nfiscal year 2016 period; and remember, this assumes that the 313-ship \nNavy is sufficient to protect American security, an optimistic \nassumption.\n  Lest the Senate get lost in all the figures, let me sum it up this \nway. The Navy, responding to budgetary pressure, has formulated a plan \nfor a 313-ship Navy in the future which, frankly, may be inadequate; \nthe Navy estimates a figure for funding the plan which independent \nauthorities, using long-term historical cost data, believe is far too \nlow. And yet without substantial increases in the Navy's procurement \nbudget, it is a dead certainty that even that figure cannot be \nsustained.\n  As a practical matter, the expected shortfall means the sacrifice of \ntwo to three attack subs and two to three surface combatants, a \nreduction in purchases of the Littoral Combat Ships, and delays to the \nSea Basing Program and the new CG-X Cruiser Program, which is necessary \nfor missile defense.\n  The short of it is that the Navy needs at least an $8 billion \nincrease per year in procurement above current estimates. The Marines \nneed about $3 billion more. It is not necessary to go into the same \nlevel of detail with regard to the budgetary picture for the other \nservices. The pain has been spread fairly evenly across the service, so \nthey are in roughly in the same situation. That means a procurement \nshortfall over the next 10 years of at least $30 billion per year \nadjusted for inflation. Most independent experts believe the number is \nfar higher.\n  For example, the CBO estimates that the overall defense budget \nshortfall will be no less than $52 billion per year. We should add to \nthis the fact that the active-duty Army is clearly too small, as we \nhave learned in Iraq. Even in an age of transformation and nonlinear \nbattlefields, there are still times when America needs to put large \nnumbers of boots on the ground, particularly in the post-September 11 \nperiod. The United States needs the ability to carry on sustained, \nlarge-scale peacekeeping or low-intensity combat operations, without \nhaving to send the same units three or four times to a combat theater \nover the duration of a mission. A nation of our size and strength \nshould not have to use essentially its whole active-duty Army,\n\n[[Page S11436]]\n\nmuch of its Marine Corps, and many of its Reserves to sustain 130,000 \ntroops over time in a combat view.\n  In 1992--which was right after Desert Storm--the Defense Department \nstated a requirement of 12 Active-Duty Army divisions. That was before \nthe increases in operational tempo of the 1990s and before the global \nwar on terror. The Army should surely be at least 12 divisions today. \nIt costs approximately $2 billion to stand up and sustain an addition \nto the Army or Marine Corps of division strength so we need to invest \n$4 billion per year in increased force structure for the Army, in \naddition to the $30 billion more in new procurement funding.\n  So to sustain our military over the next generation at the \nappropriate level, we need to increase procurement spending and \nspending on the size of the Army by about $34 billion per year. And \nthat is above current baseline estimates. It would have to be sustained \nover the life of the current defense plan and beyond.\n  I want to emphasize that this is, of necessity, a ballpark figure. It \nis always difficult to predict precisely the cost of new programs--some \nof which are in the design phase, particularly given the uncertainties \nassociated with developing technologies. We will be acquiring this \nequipment over the next 10 to 20 years and needs in technology are \ngoing to change. We must confront the fact that whatever the necessary \namount turns out precisely to be, the procurement budgets we are \nprojecting today are fundamentally inadequate. We have to ramp up \nspending. We must begin now. And we have to accept the fact that it \nwill not be cheap.\n  I, also, want to make clear that this additional $34 billion must \ncome from an increased overall defense budget. There may be some who \nsay that it is possible to cannibalize the rest of the defense budget \nto produce all or most of this additional procurement funding. That is \na dangerous fantasy. The money cannot come from the supplemental \nappropriations bills. Those are necessary to pay the day-to-day costs \nof the war and may not have been adequate to do that. The money cannot \ncome from reducing the readiness budget because that budget is \noverstressed already. It cannot come from reducing the number of \nservice personnel because the military is already too small. It can't \ncome from reducing salary and benefits. We have to retain the best \npeople. Besides, Congress is far more likely, and properly in my view, \nto increase personnel benefits rather than reduce them. Take a look at \nthe last 7 years. Total spending on defense health care, for example, \nincreased from $17.5 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $37 billion in \nfiscal year 2006--an increase of more than 100 percent over the last 7 \nyears, appropriately so.\n\n  The men and women of America's military deserve good salaries and \nbenefits, and so do those who are retired. The savings from base \nclosing is not going to supply the additional funds. Those are highly \nspeculative. They will not occur, if at all, for many years, and they \nare unlikely to be more than a billion dollars per year.\n  Some say we can save money by reducing congressional earmarks or \nadditions to the defense budget, and within limits that is true. But \nthe total of such earmarks is no more than $3 billion to $4 billion per \nyear. Realistically, Congress is not going to give up all of them, and \nat least some number of them are clearly justified because they simply \nrestore to the budget items that our service chiefs desperately wanted \nand omitted only because of budgetary pressure.\n  Still others will say we can get the necessary additional funding by \nlowering the cost of new programs through procurement reform. I am all \nfor procurement reform. I have been for it ever since Secretary Bill \nPerry, who was a great Secretary of Defense, proposed it over 10 years \nago. We have had several waves of procurement reform since then. \nSeveral Defense Secretaries have all championed its virtues. We \ncontinue to hold oversight hearings to pressure the defense industry to \nlower costs. We keep trying to catch people in the Department who might \nbe violating procurement regulations. I have chaired some of those \nhearings.\n  Meanwhile, the cost of new programs keeps going up. I suggest the \nreasons have less to do with deficiencies in the procurement system, \nbad as it is, than with the stress on the industrial base and on the \nmilitary caused by the budgets that are consistently too low and \nunstable.\n  One of the arguments supporting reductions in force in the past has \nbeen that transformational technology and tactics can empower the \nmilitary to do more with less. The idea is to make each servicemember, \neach plane, ship, and vehicle less vulnerable so we lose fewer of them, \nand more lethal so we need fewer of them. Within limits, that is \nsometimes true. But the best technology costs money, and changing \ntechnology, tactics, and doctrine makes it more difficult to fix stable \nrequirements. Program instability costs money, too.\n  Here is an example. The Navy originally planned to procure 32 DD(X) \nnext-generation destroyers. The ship has a truly advanced design. It is \na marvel of transformational technology. But its unique capabilities \nhave driven the per ship cost to about $3 billion. As a result, the \nNavy plans to procure only seven new destroyers. The problem is that \nthe complexity of the ship's design, the unprecedented capabilities of \nthe vessel, and the high price of the best technologies, have all \ndriven up cost to the point where the ship is impossible to procure in \nsufficient numbers at current budget levels.\n  Another example, the Air Force desperately needs more air lift, and \nit also needs a new tanker aircraft. The Air Force shoulders much of \nthe mobility mission, and it also performs the mid-air refueling \nmission. Normally, the Air Force would simply buy more C-17 aircraft. \nIt is a perfectly good, modern cargo aircraft. Then the Air Force would \ndesign and procure a new tanker. But because the service is under \ntremendous pressure to save money, it has decided to develop a cargo-\ntanker, combining the two missions into one aircraft. The service \nassures us that it is not going to have any bells and whistles on the \nnew plane, and the aircraft will be low in cost.\n  Surely, the concept of a cargo-tanker allows the Air Force to claim \nthat it will be able to perform both of these missions while relieving \nsome of the pressure on its budget. But, again, reality must and will \neventually bite. As requirements build and changing technologies force \nchanges in design, the odds are very high that the cost of the new \naircraft--if it is to do the combined mission it is supposed to do--\nwill go up substantially.\n  The problem of cost is exacerbated by the stress on the defense \nindustrial base. Procurement budgets have been too low for 15 years and \nbecause of budgetary pressured they constantly change. The Department \nregularly projects what it intends to procure in the outyears of its \ndefense plan but then often makes last-minute cuts and changes.\n  Under those circumstances, it is no surprise that contractors are not \ninvesting sufficiently in the defense industrial base. It is shrinking, \nand it is undercapitalized. That means fewer competitors, more sole-\nsource contracts, less research, and, therefore, higher costs. No \namount of oversight, reform, or pressure on procurement officials can \nchange that.\n  The good news is that a robust and consistent commitment to adequate \nfunding would soon begin to reverse these trends. Again, I am all for \nimprovements in the way we design and build new systems, and those \nimprovements can save money. But they cannot work miracles. Sufficient \nand stable funding is not only consistent with transformation and \nefficient use of the taxpayers' dollars, it is necessary to both. If \nCongress were to commit to my proposal, for example, the service chiefs \nand the defense industry would know that substantial new money was \ncoming--enough to make it at least plausible they could produce and \nacquire the systems they need. They could budget for the long range, \nknowing that funding would be stable. They could work together in a way \nthat would reduce costs instead of trying to pull money away from other \nservices or maneuver year to year just to keep vital programs alive, \nand often, in a way, that ends up costing the taxpayers more in the \nlong run.\n  We must stop thinking that facing reality and funding our military \nadequately is beyond the reach of this great Nation. Yes, the Federal \nGovernment has fiscal problems. Yes, the two\n\n[[Page S11437]]\n\nmajor parties have very different views on what to do about those \nproblems, but nobody can or does claim that the defense budget is the \ncause.\n  Right now, we are spending 3.8 percent of our gross domestic product \non the regular defense budget. That is a very low percentage \nhistorically, far less than we spent at any time during the Cold War. \nUnder President Carter, we spent 4.6 percent of the GDP on national \ndefense.\n  If we spent only 4.2 percent now, we could easily fund what I have \nproposed. We would have a fighting chance to support our service men \nand women with the equipment they need and deserve. We could sustain \nthe military power that the last two Presidents have used to protect \nour freedom and stabilize the post-Cold-War world. We would send the \nclearest possible message to both our friends and enemies, and to those \nnations who are deciding now whether they are going to be a friend or \nenemy, that whatever happens, whatever the direction our foreign policy \ntakes, the United States has the ability to sustain our freedom and the \nhope of freedom for the world.\n\n  To those who worry about the price of strength, I say there is a \ngreater price to be paid for weakness. How many conflicts will we \ninvite, how much instability will we engender, if we allow this \nrestless and troubled world to doubt America's ability to defend \nherself?\n  Let's look at the risks of alternative courses of action. If we adopt \nthe course I suggest, and it turns out that I was wrong, all we will \nhave lost is a fraction of our wealth wealth that would be spent in \nthis country on products produced by our workers, for a margin of \nsafety that, in the end, we did not need. But if we stay on our current \ncourse, and it turns out that I was right, how much will we pay then in \nlost lives and treasure, fighting in conflicts that a policy of \nstrength would have deterred?\n  How big will the deficit become then, in a world made less stable by \nAmerican weakness? What effect will that have on the economy, and not \njust the economy, but on the hopes and opportunities of the next \ngeneration--our children and our grandchildren--who have the right to \nexpect that we are looking out for them?\n  Twenty-five years ago, our country was also in a difficult situation. \nOur enemies doubted American resolve. They were challenging us on a \nnumber of fronts. We had just gone through a period of chronic \nunderfunding of the military, probably worse than what has happened \nrecently. As a result, the force was hollow, unable to reliably perform \nthe missions necessary to protect America. That is why the tragic \nDesert One mission went so wrong in the desert during the Iranian \nhostage crisis.\n  When President Reagan assumed office, he faced the situation squarely \nand honestly, and with the support of a Democratic House and Republican \nSenate, he secured two double-digit increases in the overall defense \nbudget, and reasonable increases for several years thereafter. On the \nstrength of that bipartisan commitment, America's service men and women \nand America's defense industrial base transformed our military into the \ntruly dominant force that fought and won Operation Desert Storm.\n  A united government sent the message to friend and foe alike that \nwhatever our differences about foreign policy, America was still \nwilling to pay the price of freedom. It is not too much to say that the \ndecisions made in 1981 and 1982 laid the basis for the collapse of the \nSoviet Union, the success of Operation Desert Storm, and the benefits \nof peace and security that we enjoyed throughout the 1990s.\n  With this speech, I bring my career in the Senate to a close. I \nbelieve I can do no greater service to my country than to urge Senators \nnot to be dissuaded by the counsels of those who say that what I have \nproposed cannot be done.\n  At the beginning of my remarks I stated that America's service men \nand women are the finest who have ever served in any military on behalf \nof any nation at any time. I should have included their families as \nwell. I realized that when today, just a few hours ago, I had the \nprivilege of meeting with Dana Lamberson and her two children, Kelsi \nand Evan.\n  Mrs. Lamberson's husband, SFC Randall Lamberson, was killed in Iraq \nonly 8 months ago. Mrs. Lamberson told me that before her husband \ndeployed, their family openly discussed the sacrifice which he, and \nthey, might be called on to make. I asked her how she was able to bear \nher grief with such grace and fortitude. She told me that when she was \ntempted to be discouraged, she remembered what her husband had always \nsaid when times were tough: that ``life is only as difficult as you \nmake it.''\n  Mr. President, I have met thousands of Americans over the last 4 \nyears like the Lamberson family, not just soldiers and their families, \nbut people from every walk of life, who live each day with courage, \nresilience, and optimism. Because of them, I believe with all my heart \nthat America's time of leadership is not done.\n  I ask the Senate to honestly face the true cost of defending this \nNation. If we do, if we carry that burden with confidence, we will find \nthe weight of it to have been a small thing compared to the blessings \nof peace and liberty we will secure for ourselves, and the hope we will \ngive to freedom-loving people all over the world.\n  Mr. President, I cannot close without thanking my dedicated staff who \nserved the people of Missouri so well over the last 4 years, who have \nkept me going, kept me on time, who are largely responsible for the \nmany pieces of legislation which Senator Bond was kind enough to \nmention. I just ask the Senate to indulge me for another moment or two \nbecause I am going to read their names. I think they deserve it: Mark \nStrand, my chief of staff; Cortney Brown, my scheduler; Les Sealy, our \ngreat office manager who always got us what we needed; Brian Anderson, \nour IT manager. I am glad he understood it because I never do.\n  I thank our legislative staff: Brett Thompson, legislative director; \nFaith Cristol, our great legislative counsel; and my legislative \nassistants: Lindsey Neas, Katie Smith, Heath Hall, Jesse Appleton, \nKatie Duckworth, Christopher Papagianis, Shamed Dogan, and John Cox, \nwho works so hard and so well on veterans issues, a man who has served \nthis country in many different venues; Andy Karellas, Martha Petkovich, \nand Sarah Cudworth, who did legislative correspondence, grants and case \nwork; Peter Henry, who managed the mail; Sarah Barfield, my staff \nassistant; two great Navy Fellows: CDR Dan Brintzinghoffer and LCDR \nLori Aguayo, two patriots and both outstanding officers; and Mark \nHegerle, my Energy Fellow who came over from the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission just in time to help me make a real difference on \nthe Energy bill.\n  I want to thank our press shop: Rich Chrismer, my great \ncommunications director; Erin Hamm, and Andrew Brandt.\n  Casework--we handled over 10,000 cases. I am a big believer in \ncasework. This is a big government, and navigating it is hard, and if \nwe could help, we wanted to help. I thank Nora Breidenbach, Jenny \nBickel, Abby Pitlick, Debbie Dornfeld, and Jessica Van Beek.\n  And the State staff, we always tried to integrate the work of the \nState staff and the Washington staff, and I think we did it. I thank \nGregg Keller, our State director; in St. Louis: Kacky Garner, my \ndistrict director; Peggy Barnhart; Rachel McCombs; and Angel McCormick \nFranks; in Kansas City: Joe Keatley, my great district director; Danny \nPfeifer; Emily Seifers; Greg Porter; and Erick Harris; in Jefferson \nCity: Donna Spickert, who was the State capitol director; and Becky \nAlmond, my instate scheduler, as well as a great staff assistant; in \nSpringfield: Terry Campbell, the district director; Christopher Stone; \nand Coriann Gastol; and in Cape Girardeau: Jeff Glenn, who directed \nthat office; and Liz Mainord.\n  I also want to thank, as other Senators have done, my family, my \nwife, obviously, in particular, who has shared the highs and lows of \nthis job, and my wonder kids.\n  Mr. President, it remains only for me to thank my colleagues in the \nSenate for the many kindnesses, personal and professional, which they \nhave shown me and my family over the last 4 years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S11438]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss a \nnumber of matters briefly.\n\n\n                      Honoring Senatorial Service\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  First, I want to join my colleagues in paying tribute to our majority \nleader, Senator Bill Frist, who has done such an outstanding job in the \npast 12 years.\n  Senator Frist came to this Senate as a real all-American. He has \ndisplayed extraordinary talents, academically, professionally, public \nservice, as a family man, as a friend, at Princeton and Harvard Medical \nSchool, a renowned heart and lung transplant surgeon, then selected to \nbe the majority leader and has taken this body through a very difficult \n4 years and a very productive 4 years.\n  A great deal has been said about Senator Frist earlier today. I just \nwanted to add my personal congratulations to him on his service and to \nwish him well.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  Mr. President, I regret the departure of my distinguished colleague, \nSenator Rick Santorum. He has been really a ball of fire in the U.S. \nCongress. He was elected in 1990 to the House of Representatives, \ndefeating a long-term incumbent by literally going door to door in his \ndistrict in the Pittsburgh area.\n  He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1994, reelected in the year \n2000, and has displayed admirable qualities--energy, determination, \nconfidence, and the pursuit of his own personal values. There is no \ndoubt that Senator Santorum has espoused, articulated, and pushed \ncauses he deeply believed in which may not have been popular in many \nquarters, but he was determined to undertake the pursuit of those \nvalues because he believed in them so deeply. I counseled him from time \nto time to save some of his philosophy for December of the year 2006.\n  A famous quotation about President Lincoln; he was asked by a little \nboy, in effect: How do you serve, Mr. President?\n  He said: I represent my true beliefs and values 90 percent of the \ntime.\n  The little boy said: Well, what about the other 10 percent?\n  The famous statement by President Lincoln: So that I can represent my \ntrue values 90 percent of the time.\n  It is not unknown in our body to occasionally defer some of the more \ncontroversial positions. But Senator Santorum didn't do that. He spoke \nhis mind and he spoke his heart. Those are rare qualities in public \nlife and public service and in politics. For that, I salute him.\n  On a personal level, Rick and I have had a superb relationship, not \nonly professionally, not only politically, but also personally. A more \ndevoted family man could not be found. He has taken this turn of \nelectoral results philosophically and in a good spirit. I have had some \nexperience on the losing end of elections and, having been there, I say \nthat he has responded with great class, with great style. His comment \nearlier this week was: Tough on the family, tough on Karen, tough on \nthe children, but now they have their husband back, and they have their \nfather back. And he had a big smile and a sense of satisfaction. He \nspoke to the caucus yesterday, and he exuded confidence. He exuded \npersonal pride in what he had done. I join him in that. As a colleague, \nI personally will miss him very much. I know that will be the sentiment \nof this body, even those with whom he has tangled in a rigorous way.\n\n\n                         Confirmation of Judges\n\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to move ahead with the \nconfirmation of judges.\n  We have U.S. District Judge Kent Jordan, of the District of Delaware, \nwho has been nominated to be a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit. He has been approved by the Judiciary Committee and \nis ready for floor action. Nobody has anything adverse to say about \nJudge Jordan. He is endorsed by both of the Delaware Senators, both of \nwhom are Democrats. They have a judicial emergency in the Third \nCircuit, and he ought to be confirmed.\n  We also have a list of some 13 district court nominations pending on \nthe executive calendar. I ask unanimous consent that the list be \nprinted at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. A good number of these nominees are also in districts \nwhere there are judicial emergencies. I think that from time to time we \nin the Senate, where we have the responsibility for confirmation, don't \nreally take seriously enough the impact of judicial vacancies. The \ncourts are busy. The Third Circuit, my circuit, is overwhelmed. \nDistrict Court Judge Jordan ought to be confirmed. My colleagues have \ntold me about the problems posed by vacancies in their states. If these \nother 13 districts nominees are not confirmed today, they will languish \nuntil who knows--January turns into February and February in March. We \nalways find a reason around here not to do something. That applies most \nemphatically to the judges.\n  It is my hope that in the 110th Congress, we will approach judicial \nconfirmations a little differently. I have already consulted with \nSenator Leahy, who will become chairman of the committee. Senator Leahy \nand I have had an excellent working relationship on a bipartisan basis, \nand the record shows it. I don't have to go into detail about that. I \nhave recommended to the White House that the it consult with Senator \nLeahy and the Democrats, as well as with Arlen Specter, as ranking \nmember, and the Republicans. There is a limited amount of time. We know \nwhat happens in a Presidential election year.\n  Let us make a determination about which judges can be confirmed--\njudges who meet the standards and criteria of President Bush but who \nalso pass muster in the U.S. Senate on both sides of the aisle. We have \nhad vacancies for interminable periods of time. I have discussed this \nwith Senator Leahy and with the White House.\n  I hope we approach the 110th Congress differently. And before this \nCongress adjourns, the 109th, I hope we will confirm these judges who \nare on the calendar awaiting floor action.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             Judicial Nominees Pending on the Senate Floor\n\n  The following nominees were all reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee prior to the October recess.

Mr. President, I introduced legislation which will \nmodify practices of the Department of Justice on the attorney-client \nprivilege where the Department of Justice, acting under a memorandum \ncalled the\n\n[[Page S11439]]\n\nThompson Memorandum by Deputy Attorney General Thompson, has initiated \na policy where requests are made to waive the attorney-client \nprivilege, and if the attorney-client privilege is not waived, then \nthat is considered in the charges brought by the Federal Government, \nand also a commitment that corporations will not pay counsel fees for \ntheir employees whom they are customarily expected to defend. This is \nan encroachment and a violation of the sixth amendment right to jury \ntrial.\n  Because of the limited time and other Senators waiting, I will not \nelaborate upon the provisions of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. __\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Attorney-Client Privilege \n     Protection Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Justice is served when all parties to litigation are \n     represented by experienced diligent counsel.\n       (2) Protecting attorney-client privileged communications \n     from compelled disclosure fosters voluntary compliance with \n     the law.\n       (3) To serve the purpose of the attorney-client privilege, \n     attorneys and clients must have a degree of confidence that \n     they will not be required to disclose privileged \n     communications.\n       (4) The ability of an organization to have effective \n     compliance programs and to conduct comprehensive internal \n     investigations is enhanced when there is clarity and \n     consistency regarding the attorney-client privilege.\n       (5) Prosecutors, investigators, enforcement officials, and \n     other officers or employees of Government agencies have been \n     able to, and can continue to, conduct their work while \n     respecting attorney-client and work product protections and \n     the rights of individuals, including seeking and discovering \n     facts crucial to the investigation and prosecution of \n     organizations.\n       (6) Despite the existence of these legitimate tools, the \n     Department of Justice and other agencies have increasingly \n     employed tactics that undermine the adversarial system of \n     justice, such as encouraging organizations to waive attorney-\n     client privilege and work product protections to avoid \n     indictment or other sanctions.\n       (7) An indictment can have devastating consequences on an \n     organization, potentially eliminating the ability of the \n     organization to survive post-indictment or to dispute the \n     charges against it at trial.\n       (8) Waiver demands and other tactics of Government agencies \n     are encroaching on the constitutional rights and other legal \n     protections of employees.\n       (9) The attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, \n     and payment of counsel fees shall not be used as devices to \n     conceal wrongdoing or to cloak advice on evading the law.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to place on \n     each agency clear and practical limits designed to preserve \n     the attorney-client privilege and work product protections \n     available to an organization and preserve the constitutional \n     rights and other legal protections available to employees of \n     such an organization.\n\n     SEC. 3. DISCLOSURE OF ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE OR \n                   ADVANCEMENT OF COUNSEL FEES AS ELEMENTS OF \n                   COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 201 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 3013 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 3014.

Preservation of fundamental legal protections and rights in the \n              context of investigations and enforcement matters \n              regarding organizations.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Attorney-Client Privilege Protection Act of 2006\n\n       The bill protects the attorney-client relationship by \n     prohibiting federal lawyers and investigators from: (1) \n     requesting that an organization waive its attorney-client \n     privilege or work product doctrine; and (2) conditioning any \n     charging decision or cooperation credit on waiver or non-\n     waiver of privilege, the payment of an employee's legal fees, \n     the continued employment of a person under investigation, or \n     the signing of a joint defense agreement.\n       All of the acts and considerations prohibited by the bill \n     are acts and considerations that federal prosecutors must \n     factor into any corporate or organizational charging decision \n     under DOJ's Thompson Memorandum, which is described in more \n     detail below.\n       The bill is appropriately narrow. It allows organizations \n     to continue offering internal investigation materials to \n     prosecutors, but only if such an offer is entirely voluntary \n     and unsolicited by the prosecutors. The bill also allows \n     prosecutors to seek materials that they reasonably believe \n     are not privileged.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I well understand that there will be no action on this \nmatter during this Congress, but I want to put it into the public \nmilieu so there can be comment about it and it will be pursued in the \nnext Congress. The Department of Justice has advised that they are \ngoing to revise the Thompson Memorandum to a memorandum called the \nMcNulty Memorandum from the Deputy Attorney General. I had hoped we \nwould have had it before the Senate went out of session so that we \ncould have reviewed it and perhaps accepted their work, but it is not \nready. I have advised Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty and also \nAttorney General Gonzales that this legislation would be introduced and \nwe can work on it in the next Congress.\n\n                              Hedge Funds\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will include for the Record proposed \nlegislation to deal with hedge funds. The Judiciary Committee has had a \nseries of hearings on this important subject, now $1.3 trillion in the \neconomy, 30 percent of the stock transactions. After reflecting on the \nmatter, I have decided not to introduce the legislation but simply to \nput the draft bill in the record so that there can be further comment. \nI talked about this proposed legislation earlier this week and had said \nthat I was going to introduce the legislation, but I want to give \ninterested parties more time to comment on it.\n\n[[Page S11440]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill and the bill \nitself be printed in the Record. I am not introducing the bill. I do \nnot look for a Senate bill number on it. But it will be in the public \nrecord, and there will be more time for people in the profession to \nevaluate and comment upon it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. __\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Criminal Misuse of Material \n     Nonpublic Information and Investor Protection Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Unlawful insider trading causes a loss of confidence in \n     the integrity of the securities markets, increases the cost \n     of equity capital, and places small investors at a \n     disadvantage.\n       (2) Unlawful insider trading and other misuse of material \n     nonpublic information is insidious and has become pervasive. \n     The number of insider trading referrals to the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission from the New York Stock Exchange has \n     doubled in the past 2 years.\n       (3) There is a need to increase the probability that \n     wrongdoers will be detected and successfully prosecuted and \n     to decrease the opportunity for misuse of material nonpublic \n     information.\n       (4) Criminal prosecutions and effective compliance programs \n     are the most effective deterrent to unlawful insider trading \n     and other misuse of material nonpublic information.\n       (5) Effective criminal enforcement has depended on close \n     cooperation and sharing of expertise and duties of \n     investigation among civil regulatory agencies, such as the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures \n     Trading Commission, the Department of Justice, and self-\n     regulatory organizations. Certain recent court decisions have \n     chilled this cooperation.\n       (6) Misuse of material nonpublic information by \n     manipulating the grant dates of stock options or timing of \n     publication of material nonpublic information for purposes of \n     more profitable trading is a form of unlawful insider trading \n     that harms investors. Public companies that adhere to a \n     regular and objectively identifiable program for selecting \n     option grant dates presumptively are not engaging in \n     fraudulent behavior regarding the grant of those options.\n       (7) The hedge fund industry currently accounts for \n     approximately 30 percent of all United States equity trading \n     volume, and this percentage has been growing rapidly. A \n     substantial percentage of the open investigations of insider \n     trading by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006 \n     involve hedge funds.\n       (8) Hedge funds increasingly are making loans, \n     participating in private placements, and sitting on \n     bankruptcy committees and corporate boards. These changes \n     increase hedge funds' access to material nonpublic \n     information. Pressure on hedge funds to deliver high returns \n     may increase the risk of insider trading or other misuse of \n     such information.\n       (9) Light regulation, secrecy, unregulated recordkeeping, \n     and limited compliance programs of hedge funds increase the \n     difficulty of detecting and proving unlawful insider trading \n     by hedge funds.\n       (10) Hedge funds enhance market liquidity and contribute to \n     pricing efficiency and market stabilization, but these \n     sophisticated instruments should be restricted to wealthy \n     investors. Recent hedge fund collapses and fraudulent trading \n     activities have harmed retirees and smaller investors who \n     increasingly are exposed to the risk of hedge funds through \n     intermediaries such as pension funds and long term growth and \n     saving vehicles. Requiring registration with the Securities \n     and Exchange Commission by hedge funds or hedge fund advisers \n     that sell securities to or manage investments of pension \n     funds and smaller investors strikes the appropriate balance \n     between investor protection and capital formation needs.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to ensure \n     effective criminal enforcement of prohibitions against \n     unlawful insider trading and effective protection of the \n     integrity of the securities markets and investors who use \n     them by authorizing coordination of investigation by civil \n     regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice, providing \n     effective incentives for private citizens to report and \n     provide evidence of misuse of material nonpublic information, \n     requiring hedge funds to create and enforce effective \n     compliance programs and ensure maintenance of records, and \n     removing exemptions from coverage under the Securities Act of \n     1933, and the Investment Company Act of 1940, for hedge funds \n     that choose to sell to and manage investments of pension \n     funds and retail investors, unless the adviser or manager is \n     registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``hedge fund''--\n       (A) means a privately offered, pooled investment vehicle--\n       (i) that is not widely available to the public; and\n       (ii) the assets of which are managed by a professional \n     investment management firm or other fund manager or adviser; \n     and\n       (B) does not include a private equity, venture capital, or \n     real estate fund; and\n       (2) the term ``qualified purchaser'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 2 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 \n     (15 U.S.C. 80a-2).\n\n     SEC. 4.

INCENTIVES FOR PRIVATE CITIZENS TO REPORT AND ASSIST \n                   IN THE INVESTIGATION OF UNLAWFUL INSIDER \n                   TRADING; PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION.\n\n       (a) Awards.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General of the United States \n     may award an amount equal to not more than 30 percent of any \n     fine, penalty, or settlement recovered by the Attorney \n     General to a person who provides information leading to the \n     prosecution of unlawful insider trading, or other violation \n     of section 1348 of title 18, United States Code, (as amended \n     by this Act), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \n     78a et seq.), or a related wire or mail fraud.\n       (2) Considerations.--In making an award under this \n     subsection, the Attorney General shall take into account--\n       (A) the importance of the information provided by the \n     person;\n       (B) whether the Federal Government had some or all of the \n     information provided by the person before that person \n     provided that information;\n       (C) whether the information was provided voluntarily;\n       (D) whether the person was complicit;\n       (E) the assistance of other persons; and\n       (F) the amount of the fine, penalty, or settlement from \n     which the award will be paid.\n       (3) Identity.--The identity of a person providing \n     confidential information regarding unlawful insider trading \n     or related fraud may remain anonymous, and that person may \n     still be eligible to receive an award under this subsection, \n     if that person provides sufficient evidence to allow the \n     identification of that person as the source of that \n     information.\n       (4) Exclusions.--A Federal employee or an employee of a \n     self-regulatory organization (as that term is defined in \n     section 3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. \n     78c)) may not receive an award under this subsection if the \n     information provided to the Federal Government was gained in \n     the course of the employment of that person.\n       (b) Retaliation.--A person who suffers retaliation because \n     that person, in good faith\n\n[[Page S11441]]\n\n     and with reasonable basis, has provided specific information \n     about unlawful insider trading to the Federal Government, or \n     has assisted in a Federal investigation of unlawful insider \n     trading, may file a private action in a United States \n     district court against the person or entity that has engaged \n     in the retaliation, and may recover damages based on economic \n     losses resulting from such retaliation, and attorneys' fees.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, I urge the confirmation of Dr. Andrew von \nEschenbach to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. \nVon Eschenbach is a native Philadelphian. He has had a very \ndistinguished professional record. He has served as the director of the \nNational Cancer Institute. He has made a commitment publicly to lead \nthe way to conquer cancer by the year 2015. Frankly, that is not good \nenough for me. I think we ought to do it sooner.\n  In 1970, President Nixon declared war on cancer. Had we pursued that \nwar with the same diligence we have pursued other wars, many people \nwould not have died and many people would not have contracted cancer. \nDr. Von Eschenbach has done an outstanding job in his professional \ncareer, and he would make an excellent Commissioner of the FDA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement of his qualifications and \nbackground be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Statement of Senator Arlen Specter--Nomination of Dr. Andrew von \n      Eschenbach Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration\n\n       Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \n     speak in support of the nomination of Dr. Andrew von \n     Eschenbach to be Commissioner of the Food and Drug \n     Administration. Dr. von Eschenbach brings an extraordinary \n     record to the FDA as he has accomplished a great deal.\n       I am pleased that the Senate invoked cloture on Dr. von \n     Eschenbach's nomination, and that the Health, Education, \n     Labor and Pensions committee unanimously supported the \n     nomination of such an accomplished Pennsylvanian. A native of \n     Philadelphia, Dr. von Eschenbach earned a B.S. from St. \n     Joseph's University in Philadelphia in 1963, and his medical \n     degree from Georgetown University School of Medicine in 1967. \n     He completed residencies at Pennsylvania Hospital in general \n     surgery and urology and taught urology at the University of \n     Pennsylvania School of Medicine. He also served in the U.S. \n     Navy Medical Corps with the rank of lieutenant commander from \n     1968 to 1971. Dr. von Eschenbach is a nationally recognized \n     urologic surgeon and oncologist, and his distinguished career \n     as a leader in the fight against cancer spans over three \n     decades.\n       As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education Appropriations subcommittee, I have worked with Dr. \n     von Eschenbach in his capacity as director of the National \n     Cancer Institute (NCI). When Dr. von Eschenbach was \n     president-elect of the American Cancer Society, he was \n     selected by President George W. Bush to head the NCI in \n     December 2001. As director of the NCI, he announced in 2003 \n     that his organization's goal was to ``eliminate suffering and \n     death'' caused by cancer by the year 2015.\n       In 1970, the President of the United States, Richard Nixon, \n     declared war on cancer and had that war been pursued with the \n     same diligence and resources that we pursue other wars, I \n     would not have gotten cancer, my former chief of staff, Carey \n     Lackman would not have died of cancer, a good friend of mine, \n     Paula Kline, wife of Tom Kline, my former law partner, and my \n     good friend Federal Judge Edward Becker would not have died. \n     It is something that we hear about every day. Dr. von \n     Eschenbach, a cancer survivor himself, understands the need \n     for better cancer treatments. During Dr. von Eschenbach's \n     tenure as Director of the NCI, funding for the NCI for FY03 \n     was $4.67 billion. Today, recommended Senate funding for the \n     NCI is $4.8 billion, an increase of $13 million. However, it \n     is concerning that the funding for the NCI in fiscal year \n     2006 was $50 million less than fiscal year 2005.\n       If Dr. von Eschenbach is confirmed, I look forward to \n     working with him as Commissioner of the FDA. His expertise, \n     experience, and commitment to public service will be of great \n     services to our nation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                             Rick Santorum\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I am going to take a couple minutes to \ntalk about my great friend Rick Santorum. Election night; a lot of \nemotions going on; no question my heart was torn because my best friend \nin the Senate lost the election that night. I was saddened simply from \na personal level, but I was also saddened for our country because I \nbelieve Rick Santorum has served this country so well. His integrity, \nhis vision--so many things about this man have really been \nextraordinary.\n  I have gotten to know a lot of the people around him, his staff. It \nsays a lot about him because of how many of them are sitting in this \nroom today. The quality of the people he has around him says a \ntremendous amount about\n\n[[Page S11442]]\n\nhim, as does the passion with which they served him and the passion \nwith which he serves the country.\n  I also came to know Karen and his six kids. They are extraordinary \npeople. Rick is a great leader of his home. Just seeing the love and \nrespect that Karen has for Rick and that his children have for him as a \nfather says a lot about him as an individual as well.\n  I am going to keep this short. This is completely from the heart. I \ncan say with confidence that as a human being, there have been maybe as \ngood human beings who have served in this Senate, but there have been \nno better. He is that quality of a human being. His faith leads him to \nthat. I consider it a great privilege to have served with him and to \ncall him a friend over these last 6 years. I know the friendship he and \nI share will be a lifetime friendship.\n  Rick, this body will miss you greatly, but no one in this body will \nmiss you more than I.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Farewell to the Senate\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, let me thank my great friend and \ncolleague from Nevada for his very kind words. I thank him for coming \nto hear my last speech on the floor of the Senate. I know there are \nmany listening who are applauding at this moment for that. But I come \nhere with a wonderful spirit. I have written on the top of the page the \nsame words that I wrote the night of the election, and that is the word \n``gratitude'' because that is all I feel--an incredible sense of \ngratitude.\n  Mark Rodgers is my long-time friend and chief of staff, now head of \nthe conference. We were talking again this morning about coming to work \nevery day and walking up to the Capitol Building every day for 16 years \nnow and still feeling that, wow, I work here--every day for 16 years. \nIt was such a gift, such an incredible gift to be blessed to serve the \npeople of the 18th District in the Congress, southwestern Pennsylvania, \nin Allegheny County, and for 12 incredible years to be able to serve \nthe people of Pennsylvania here.\n  So first and foremost, I want to thank who is most responsible--and \nthat is God--for this great gift he has bestowed upon me and my \nfamily--to be able the serve the greatest country in the history of the \nworld and to serve in a body that is, and hopefully will be, the \ngreatest deliberative body in the world. I think back to my dad, when \nhe came to this country, and my mom, who is a second generation, and I \nthink of how I grew up. It is amazing what a great country this is and \nhow God has bestowed upon me and my family tremendous blessings. So I \nthank Him for the opportunity he has given me to serve. We are all \ncalled to serve. Some are frustrated because they don't think they are \nin a job or a position in life where they are doing what God has called \nthem to do. God has blessed me with the opportunity to do this and to \nserve in a way that I hope he has called me to serve.\n  Second, I thank my family. Karen and the kids are watching. They have \nsuffered a lot and have sacrificed a lot in 16 years. I was telling \nJohn the other day that it is amazing how you think you are doing \ncertain things well, and then you have the opportunity to spend a \nlittle more time doing those things and you realize how insufficiently \nyou did them in the past. A phrase from the Bible is ringing in my \nears, ``the scales falling off of the eyes.'' In the last month or so, \nI have had a lot of scales fall from my eyes--to see not just what the \n2 years have been to my family, which have been a tough 2 or 3 years, \nbut the accumulation of 16 years in what is a very difficult life. I \nknow everybody here recognizes that because you live it. They know how \ndifficult this life is, how public everything we do and say is or what \nwe are accused of. We think we understand how difficult that is for our \nfamily, but I don't think we really do. I want to say thank you to \nKaren, who I picture in my mind with this T-shirt dress she wore and \nhad stenciled on it ``Santorum for Congress.'' She went knocking on \ndoors in 1990, when no one gave us a chance. We did the impossible. We \nwere able to defeat a 14-year incumbent who no one thought could be \nbeat. I would not have even come close to winning that election but for \nher.\n  In 1994, it was the same thing. She went out with the two children at \nhome and she spent day after day--not traveling with, no; she was \ngiving speeches in her own right and traveling all over the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania, sacrificing. They continued to do that \nday after day, year after year. I was a Senator, and I had important \nthings to do.\n  I tell stories all the time about debates that were held on the floor \nof the Senate, when I would call Karen and say I had to come back to \nthis very place and say more. There was never a hesitation. She served \nmore than I did. My children--none of them have known their father \nwithout being in politics. I got married in 1990 to Karen, and \nElizabeth came along 11 months later. Their life has been with their \nfather in politics, in the public arena. They have had to deal with \nthat in both pleasurable ways and some very painful ways. So I thank \nthem for being without their dad far too often. Even when they are with \ntheir dad, I am not as attentive as I should have been. But I think \nthey knew and they shared in the endeavor because they knew it was \nimportant for them and for our country.\n  So, hopefully, out of this experience they have been given a sense of \npurpose, and they know more about what life should be all about and \nthat is to serve--serve God, serve your family, serve your community, \nand to serve your country. It is a great blessing. I thank them for the \nopportunity they have given me, through their sacrifice, to do that for \nthe last 16 years.\n  I thank my mom and dad and Karen's mom and dad and all in our family \nwho have been supportive every step of the way--sometimes wondering why \nI was doing this, sometimes unable to walk to the end of the driveway \nand pick up the paper for fear of what next was going to be said about \ntheir son-in-law or son. But they stood with us and fought with us and \nthey comforted us. I thank them.\n  John mentioned the people who are here in this room, my staff.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed a list of all of the folks \nwho worked for us over the last 12 years in the Senate at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish I could read all these names, but \nthere are a lot of names. These are people who worked for me in my \npersonal office in Washington and in my offices across the State and \nthe people who worked here in Washington in my leadership office at the \nSenate Republican Conference. John said it so well. These are \nincredible people. I have had the opportunity now in the last few days \nto sit and talk with each one of my staff members to find out what they \nare doing and to get any final thoughts they would have. One after \nanother, I have been amazed at the dedication, intelligence, caring, \nand the commitment of service they had to the people of Pennsylvania, \nor to the causes I have attempted to do my best to fight for in the \nSenate. These are incredibly talented people whom I have been so \nblessed to be associated with and to work with.\n  I looked at the list of our legislative accomplishments and I can \nsay, yes, I worked on that, but on the autism legislation, Jennifer \nVesey wrote it, not me. She spent 16 months working with 15 offices. In \nfact, let me do something at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11442-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11442-S11451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMBATING AUTISM ACT OF 2006\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the House amendment, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, we just passed the combating autism bill \nthat we have been working on for 16 months. I thank Senator Dodd for \nhis tremendous work on that. I thank all of the autism groups. I thank \nJennifer Vesey for the tremendous work she did and the hours and hours \nand patience it takes to put together complex and important pieces of \nlegislation.\n  Later today, or tomorrow, we are going to pass the abandoned mine \nlands bill. I would love to say that was Rick Santorum, but it was \nAshley Horning; it wasn't Rick Santorum. She did all the work. I pretty \nmuch knew what was in there, and I would negotiate the parts in \ndisagreement. That is what we all do. But on 90 percent of the bills \nthat most of us know about, we didn't hammer out the details; it was \ndone by folks who have the commitment and vision and effort and work \nthe long hours to make the legislation possible. It is important that \nin Pennsylvania now we will get a billion dollars to clean up abandoned \nmines--it is a tremendous contribution to the environment--or miners \nwill have health care coverage paid because, in part, I had a terrific \nstaff person. I can go down through issue after issue and look at these \naccomplishments that would be great to stand up and say that I did, but \nI had a tremendous amount of help. I had incredibly talented, gifted \npeople who worked incredible hours.\n  What most people across America don't realize is how hard our people \naround here work. They don't do it for the money. They don't do it \nbecause they have some agenda to accomplish. They do it because they \nwant to improve America, make America a better place. They want to \nleave this place better than how they found it. They want to serve \nbecause they love this country and they believe in what will make this \ncountry better. They work long hours. They don't get paid as much as \nthey could make if they wandered off the Hill. I will put my folks, \nboth in Washington and across the State, up against anybody. They are \nsitting in the gallery and here along the railing. They have given \ntheir all and I thank them. They served the people of Pennsylvania. \nLooking at Kevin Roy over there, I think of all of the earmarks--that \nis a dirty word--that we were able to get to help the people in \nPennsylvania in so many ways. I look at work we did for the nonprofit \ncommunity and welfare and families, and Melanie Looney and her team \nworked on that.\n  It has been an incredible group. Our Senate conference, the message \nfolks--it was awfully hard. Republicans are not good on the old message \nissue. We don't follow our talking points very well. We try. We try. We \nhave a lot of independent thinkers on our side. God bless them. They \nalways have a better way of saying things than what we suggest or \nactually not even saying things, thinking things than what we suggest. \nThat is the beauty of our party. We have a lot of diversity within our \nparty.\n  We have some very talented people who work very hard, not just a dry \nmessage to spin, but to try to move the debate, try to get our causes \narticulated in a way that is communicated effectively to people across \nAmerica. They worked hard. They built coalitions. They did their best, \nand I thank them for their effort and the tremendous service they have \ngiven our conference.\n  I thank the folks in my district offices. Most of those folks have \nbeen with me 16 years. We don't have a lot of turnover in our office. A \nlot of folks in Pittsburgh have been with me 16 and others around the \nState have been with me 12 years. They are dedicated people who go out \nand do those security checks and veterans benefits and medals.\n  I will always remember one story that happened this last year. There \nwas a man, a World War II vet named Patrick. I was at a ribbon-cutting \nfor a VA facility in Oakland in Pittsburgh. While I was there, we \narranged a little medal presentation to a veteran who had sought a \nmedal and was never given that medal. That is all I knew about it. I \nshowed up. There was this older gentleman sitting in the front row. His \nname was Patrick.\n  Patrick was a World War II veteran who served in Patton's army and \nwas sent on a secret mission to try to liberate a POW camp. In that \nmission, he was captured. He was imprisoned for several months, I \nbelieve, in a German POW camp. When he got out of the Army, he \nrequested a POW medal, but the paperwork didn't show he had been \ncaptured. It was a secret mission, and it never appeared on his \nmilitary record.\n  For 60 years, Patrick fought to get his designation as a POW. He \nnever married. In fact, later in his life after he retired from work, \nhe became somewhat of a recluse because he was kidded by some of his \nbuddies about being a POW. It affected him dramatically, so much so \nthat one of his friends and relatives contacted us to say: Is there \nanything you can do? Could it possibly be true?\n  Ann Blocksidge in my office in Pittsburgh, wizard that she is with \nthese issues that she has been working on now for 16 years, knew the \nplaces to call and put the records together. We found out, yes, he was, \nand that was in one place in one record and not in the same place as \nthe other record, and A didn't talk to B. So we were able to get him \nhis POW medal.\n  I remember pinning it on him. This older man walked to the \nmicrophone. He said: There is one thing I want to say. He said: I \nfinally feel welcomed home.\n  It is a great story, but the folks in my office and offices all over \nthis Capitol do this every day because they care, because the people \ncall with impossible things, and our folks do impossible things to help \nthem.\n\n[[Page S11446]]\n\n  I thank all of them for all the service they have done, for doing \nwhat I ask them to do when they come into the office: Treat every \ncaller as if it is your grandmother calling. If you treat every caller \nas if it is your grandmother--hopefully they get along with their \ngrandmother--then things will be fine.\n  I thank my colleagues. This place gets a lot of ridicule. It is very \neasy to criticize people in the fishbowl. It is very easy to take shots \nat people for not living up to expectations, and certainly we all do \nnot live up to expectations. But I think I can say without any \nreservation that the men and women in this body are good and decent \npeople who are doing what they believe is best for this country.\n  I know many people find that hard to believe because they look at \npeople and they have beliefs so diametrically opposed to people in this \nChamber. I certainly have views--and have demonstrated that on many \noccasions on the floor of the Senate--that are diametrically opposed to \nmany people in this Chamber. But in my heart, I never questioned the \nintegrity and the sincerity of the people who articulated their \nopinions, that they were not sincere. I believed them to be sincere and \nI believed them to believe that it was in the best interest of the \ncountry. That is what is supposed to happen here. Ideas are to be \ndebated, points of view are to be discussed, and the prevailing thought \nof the day will move the country in that direction.\n  There are very good people here. I tell the people of America: There \nare very good people here. There are people here on both sides of the \naisle who pray every single day for God's guidance. There are people \nhere today who, while we fight and argue, do so out of a passion for \ndoing what is right.\n  I thank my colleagues for the courtesies they have shown me, and \nparticularly my Republican colleagues for the honor they have given me \nto serve in the leadership for 6 years. I know that was not an easy \ndecision back in 2001 to elect someone who had a reputation of being \nsomewhat of a bomb thrower in the House and in my early Senate days to \na position of leadership in the Senate. They took a risk. I hope they \nfeel it has paid off.\n  It has certainly been a great blessing to me to have been able to \nserve my colleagues in the capacity of conference chairman.\n  It is an incredible group of people. I think of John, who is my \ntennis partner. We played our first match after I was defeated, and he \nbeat me 6-love, 6-1. He thinks it is because he played better, but I am \njust preparing for other employment.\n  We have prayer groups here. One of the most important things in my \nlife over the past 12 years has been the Senate prayer group, the \nSenate Bible study, and the prayer breakfasts, the small prayer group \nwith which I have been involved. I don't know how people do it. I don't \nknow how people do this business without prayer, without an \nunderstanding that there is something bigger than us here, something \nthat will help us, guide us, lift us up at times when there seems to be \nno other reason to be lifted up.\n  I thank all of those who prayed with me and prayed for me. Lloyd \nOgilvie, a chaplain here for many years, and Barry Black, our Chaplain \nnow--they are prayer warriors for all of us. I know they pray for us \nevery day. I know Lloyd still prays for us every day, and I know \nmillions of Americans pray for us every day. I thank all of them for \nhelping me through and helping us and helping our country through these \ndifficult times.\n  I thank our leader, Bill Frist, my first leader I served under as a \nmember of the leadership, Trent Lott, and the leader I served under \nwhen I came to the Senate, Bob Dole. Each and every one of them in \ntheir own way led differently. But in the case of Senator Dole, he was \na larger-than-life figure to me, coming over to the Senate as a 36-\nyear-old Senator. He was on his way to run for the Presidency. He took \nthe time to be concerned about the issues that were important to me. He \nput me on the committees I needed to be on and gave me the opportunity \nthat I will never forget and certainly will always be thankful for--to \nmanage and work on the welfare reform bill back in 1996.\n  Of all the things I accomplished in the Senate, there is nothing I am \nmore proud of than what we did in 1996 to reform the welfare system and \ntransition it so millions and millions would fall off the rolls, find \ngainful employment, and change their lives and the lives of their \nfamilies. I owe that to Bob Dole. He gave me the opportunity to stand \nat that manager's chair for months in my second year in the Senate and \ntaking on what I would argue was the most important piece of \nlegislation in that session of the Congress, the Republican revolution.\n  I thank Trent Lott not only for his tutelage and mentoring me in the \ntime I have been here as a leader, but for helping me in gaining \nleadership and being involved in the leadership in the Senate.\n  I thank Bill Frist for his friendship. His coming in as a leader when \nI was already in the leadership was a little different. He didn't come \nin and point the finger and boss around, but he came in to learn. He \ncame in to engage, to try to take the knowledge that was in the \nleadership group and use it to build a stronger group. I appreciate \nthat.\n  There is a humility in Bill Frist. It is a very attractive quality \nand, I might also add, a rather rare quality if one is in the Senate, \nbut a very attractive one and a very important one in Senators and \nleaders.\n  I thank, I guess finally, the people of Pennsylvania. I was talking \nto Jim Towey. Jim is the new president of Saint Vincent College in \nLatrobe, PA. Jim is the former director of the faith-based office for \nthe President. I called him the other day. He said: You know, Rick, I \nhave been here--I think he said 6 months. He said: I really like the \nState, like the area, good people. But the more I study the State and \nthe more I get the feel of Pennsylvania, I have one question: It is not \nhow did you lose the election, but how did you get elected here twice?\n  I got elected twice because I had a lot of wonderful people who \ncampaigned hard, worked hard, and believed in me and were able to maybe \nsee past some of the differences with me to give me an opportunity to \nserve here, and I am eternally grateful.\n  It is an incredible State. It is one I got to know very well and, \nobviously, got to know thousands of people. I had the opportunity to \nserve them. I had the opportunity to be scolded by them, reprimanded by \nthem. But I always understood they were my employers. I work for them. \nAnd when you work for somebody, sometimes they are going to tell you \nthey don't like the job you are doing. And you better act like someone \nwho is an employee instead of an employer or you are not going to find \nyourself as an employee very much longer. Well, I tried to act like an \nemployee. But that doesn't mean I always had to agree with my employer, \nand a lot of times I didn't. And maybe I spoke up too often too loudly \nand too boldly on some of the things that my employer didn't agree \nwith. I hope they respect the fact that it was a heartfelt disagreement \nand that I did what I did and I said what I said because I believed it \nwas in their best interests, even though they may not have thought so.\n\n  I respect the fact that I didn't win this election and that the \npeople of Pennsylvania made a different decision. I had an opportunity \nto meet with my successor today in my office and get a chance to talk \nwith him about some of the ins and outs of the Senate. He is a good \nman, and he will do a good job. I hope the people of Pennsylvania will \ngive him and extend to him the same courtesies and trust and \ncooperation that so many Pennsylvanians who didn't agree with me on a \nlot of things but knew that it was important to work together--such as \nour Governor, Ed Rendell, whom I worked with as mayor and as Governor, \nas well as I did with any Republican that I know--I hope that \nRepublican officeholders in Pennsylvania treat my opponent with the \nsame kind of respect and the same kind of cooperation that Governor \nRendell and I have had over the years.\n  That brings me to my colleague, Senator Specter. It was very kind of \nArlen to come and say a few words. He said that we are not only \ncolleagues in the Senate and, obviously, colleagues from Pennsylvania, \nbut we are friends. I have to tell my colleagues, when I first came to \nthe Senate, I thought it was a very long shot that I would be friends \nwith Arlen Specter. All I had\n\n[[Page S11447]]\n\nheard about Arlen Specter was how prickly a character he is, how \ndifficult he is, sort of cold and tough. But he is a pretty soft guy. \nHe really is. He gets those granddaughters around him and he just \nmelts. No, he is a good man. I don't agree with Arlen a lot, and of \ncourse everybody knows that, but Arlen has been a good partner. We have \nworked on a lot of things together. And even when we disagreed, we \nunderstood and respected the disagreement and didn't let it affect us, \nor certainly our relationship, or if it was important enough to us and \nimportant enough to the State and important enough to the country, we \nworked hard to try to bridge those differences. I think that is a good \nmodel. I recommend it to my successor. I recommend it to all my \ncolleagues.\n  This place doesn't have to be as personally confrontational as it is. \nI say that as someone who was pretty personally combative when I first \ncame here. I know that I have had some pretty strident debates on the \nfloor of the Senate, but I will tell my colleagues that in my heart, it \nwas never personal, it was always about what the issue was about. And \nit is hard for a lot of people in America who look at it in a culture \nthat takes everything personally--people have asked me why I have been \nso comfortable and at ease with what has happened, and it is because I \ndon't take it personally. People disagree with where I wanted to take \nthis country, and that is fine. They will have an opportunity to take \nit someplace else, for now.\n  But I don't take it personally. I look at the empty desks of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, and I look at each and every \none and I can see them all sitting there, and I can't think of one that \nI would take a disagreement with personally--and I have had \ndisagreements with virtually every one but all of them have disagreed, \nhopefully without being personally disagreeable. That is how this place \nworks. It is the only way it can work and be successful for America.\n  In closing, I want to say that I always come back to the word \n``gratitude.'' To God, to my family, to my colleagues, to the wonderful \npeople who have worked for me and with me over the years, to the people \nof the 18th Congressional District, to the people of Pennsylvania: \nThank you. Thank you. I don't know what I will be doing next, but I \ncannot imagine that anything I do in the future will rival the kind of \nblessings I have felt from all of the folks whom I have mentioned. The \nrelationships and the wonderful accomplishments and the great spirit I \nhave experienced over these last 16 years is something that I am \neternally grateful for to all of those involved. It has been a great \nblessing.\n  I thank my colleagues, I thank those who came and listened, those who \nmight be listening in other ways, but I thank them, personally, for the \ngreat kindness they have shown me. I leave a very happy and contented \nformer Senator from Pennsylvania who feels very blessed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                    Senate Personal Office Employees\n\n       Aho, Robert W;

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say to my good friend from \nPennsylvania, before he leaves the floor, what an extraordinary 16 \nyears he has had representing the people of his State and what a truly \noutstanding Member of the Senate he has been and what a moving farewell \naddress I had an opportunity to witness. Good luck, good friend, and \nGodspeed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the pending \nnomination occur at 5:45 today and that prior to the vote, Senator \nGrassley be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes, Senator Enzi for \nup to 5 minutes, and Senator Kennedy for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Food and Drug \nAdministration will finally have a confirmed\n\n[[Page S11448]]\n\nCommissioner. And I am glad that the President's nominee, Dr. Andrew \nvon Eschenbach, has acted to address concerns that have been raised \nabout his nomination. He addressed conflict-of-interest concerns by \nresigning his position as head of the National Cancer Institute. The \nFDA also approved access to emergency contraception without a \nprescription. This decision should have been made when the FDA's expert \npanel recommended it, and I was disappointed at the shameless \npoliticizing of science over emergency contraception. With those issues \nnow resolved, I will vote for his nomination.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach to be Commissioner Food and Drugs.\n  I am pleased that the Senate is considering Dr. von Eschenbach's \nnomination and I strongly urge my colleagues to support him because the \nFDA needs a permanent Commissioner to lead the agency. The FDA has been \ncriticized time and time again over this. To me, the first step toward \npromoting stability in the agency is for the Senate to confirm an FDA \nCommissioner. Dr. von Eschenbach is a capable administrator, extremely \nknowledgeable about health care and food and drug policy, and we can \ncount on him to do the right thing. It is past the time that he be \nconfirmed.\n  I had the opportunity to work with Dr. von Eschenbach when he was the \nDirector of the National Cancer Institute and found him to be \npersonable and engaging. I also had a long meeting with Dr. von \nEschenbach before his Senate confirmation hearing and was very \nimpressed with his in depth knowledge on matters before the Food and \nDrug Administration. But even more impressive, Dr. von Eschenbach truly \nlistened to my ideas regarding the FDA, and I greatly appreciated it. \nIt is clear that he intends to work closely with the Congress.\n  The bottom line is that I am convinced Dr. von Eschenbach is the best \nperson for the job, and the sooner we get him confirmed, the better.\n  I would like to take a moment to talk about FDA-related issues facing \nmy home State of Utah and where Dr. von Eschenbach's strong involvement \nwill be crucial.\n  As my colleagues are aware, Utah is home to the largest concentration \nof dietary supplement companies in our Nation, so ensuring that the \nDietary Supplement Health and Education Act, DSHEA, law is strongly and \nappropriately enforced is a high priority of mine.\n  I have been told by every FDA Commissioner since Dr. Kessler that the \nFDA has adequate authority under DSHEA to make certain the supplement \nmarketplace is safe, so it is my hope that Dr. von Eschenbach will make \nthis a priority during his tenure as FDA Commissioner.\n  In addition, as I have told him on more than one occasion, it is \nessential for Dr. von Eschenbach to work to finalize and implement good \nmanufacturing practices--GMPs--for supplements as authorized by DSHEA. \nIt is 12 years since they were authorized. And, despite the repeated \ncontacts Senator Harkin and I have made, the reportedly drafted \nregulations have still not been issued. I want to encourage strongly \nDr. von Eschenbach to address this matter once and for all.\n  We will also be counting on the good doctor to implement the new \nsystem of mandatory reporting of serious adverse events--AERs--for \nnonprescription drugs and dietary supplements that is contained in S. \n3546, the Hatch-Durbin bill we passed last night. It is my hope the \nHouse will pass the bill today--and it can be sent to the President for \nsignature. When enacted, the Hatch-Durbin-Harkin-Enzi-Kennedy bill will \nrequire manufacturers of supplements and over-the-counter drugs to \nreport to FDA any reports of serious problems associated with the use \nof the products. This is an important consumer protection bill, and it \nis important that FDA seek the funding to implement the program as \nCongress intends. I stand ready to work with the agency on this.\n  Another concern I have expressed to Dr. von Eschenbach and his agency \nis the need to look out for the ``little guy'' once he becomes \nCommissioner. Utah is the home to more than 100 medical device \ncompanies, many of them small, and I want Dr. von Eschenbach and his \nstaff to treat these companies fairly, especially when the FDA \nofficials conduct inspections. There have been several complaints from \nmanufacturers about the tactics that the FDA inspectors have taken. I \nthink these complaints have merit. All I ask of Dr. von Eschenbach is \nthat Utah companies be treated fairly by the FDA.\n  I also am deeply concerned about the agency's lack of funding. This \nhas been a growing concern, especially as it affects implementation of \nDSHEA, the new AEER system, and also the review of generic drug \napplications. While I realize that FDA has a lot of responsibilities, \nranging from ensuring the safety of drugs and medical devices to \nprotecting our country's food supply, it simply isn't fair to continue \nto pile on these responsibilities without providing the FDA with \nadequate funding. I assure Dr. von Eschenbach that I will work with him \nand my colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Senate \nHELP Committee to ensure that the agency is provided with sufficient \nfunding.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of Dr. von Eschenbach today so \nthat the agency will finally have a permanent leader who will look out \nfor the best interests of both the American people and an important \nFederal agency--the FDA.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise before you today to discuss the \nnomination of Andrew Von Eschenbach as Commissioner of the FDA.\n  I first want to say that I love the FDA. FDA is in my home state of \nMaryland. It employs over 10,000 of my constituents. It is right down \nthe road from the NIH. I am proud to have all that research at NIH and \nthen have FDA in Maryland standing up for the food safety of the \nAmerican people, looking out to make sure that the drugs and the \ntechnologies that we use are safe.\n  Over the years, I have fought for the right facilities, the right \nresources, and now the right leadership at the FDA. Dr. Von Eschenbach \nis an experienced clinician and researcher and as the former Director \nof National Cancer Institute, NCI, I presume he is committed to the \nmission of FDA. However, I have concerns. I have yellow flashing light \nabout his commitment to reform over drug safety, to not politicize \nscience, and to establish a channel where employees can speak truth to \npower.\n  This is important. As we consider the nomination of Dr. Von \nEschenbach, we must address one of the most important issues facing our \nNation: the loss of confidence in our Government's ability to ensure \nthe safety of our food, our drugs, and our medical devices. The FDA has \nalways been the gold standard in maintaining the safety and efficacy of \nour drugs and medical devices.\n  Yet today the Agency is being politicized and degraded. The current \nadministration has shown a persistent pattern of placing politics \nbefore science; making appointments based on ideology instead of \ncompetency; stifling scientists whose findings do not meet political \nobjectives; making decisions based on politics, rather than sound \nscience.\n  Nowhere is this more evident than at the FDA. Today, FDA is facing a \ncrisis: There is a crisis of morale. There is a crisis of confidence in \nthe reliability of FDA decisions. There is a crisis about whether there \nare scientists operating under a gag rule, putting politics above \nscience. There is a crisis ensuring the reliability and safety of our \ndrugs.\n  This summer, Union of Concerned Scientists released its survey of the \nscientists at the FDA. These scientists are my constituents. They found \nthe morale of trusted and respected employees has been battered by \nyears of weak leadership. This survey is important because it gives a \npublic voice to scientists who aren't in a position to place their jobs \non the line to suffer retaliation for speaking the truth and to \npotentially jeopardize their families.\n  The FDA needs a major overhaul and a culture change at the highest \nlevels in order to continue to meet its mission. The FDA needs to \nreestablish its relationship with its own scientists. The FDA's focus \nshould be only on science and the public good. And I am hoping that Dr. \nVon Eschenbach will be the strong leader the FDA needs to accomplish \nthis overhaul.\n  My criterion for looking at every nomination are competence, \nintegrity,\n\n[[Page S11449]]\n\ncommitment to the mission of the Agency.\n  Competence: Management expertise is essential to effectively run FDA \nwithout redtape and bureaucracy. The FDA has over 10,000 dedicated \nemployees and has a budget of nearly $2 billion. Strong management \nskills and leadership are essential to ensure that FDA can efficiently \nand effectively carry out its many responsibilities.\n  Integrity: The individual must be well-respected by patient/consumer \ngroups and the industry so that FDA commands the respect of the public \nand the industry it regulates. The FDA Commissioner must also be an \nhonest broker and listener who can make tough calls on contentious \nissues.\n  Commitment to the mission of the Agency: Decisions must be made based \non sound science and public health, not ideology. The nominee must \nmaintain the FDA gold standard of safety and efficacy, ensuring timely \napproval of new therapies to save lives, help patients live longer and \nimprove their quality of life and ensuring safety of our food supply.\n  The FDA needs strong leadership. Dr. Von Eschenbach is an experienced \nand respected scientist. We need his leadership to help Congress \nestablish the legislative framework needed to reform FDA: We need to \nrestore the morale at FDA; we need to restore confidence in the FDA for \nall Americans; and we need to restore FDA to the world's premier food \nand safety regulatory agency.\n  We need his commitment to ensure that the best possible science \ninforms the decisions the FDA makes every day. We need him to ensure a \nculture of openness so that management listens to and addresses the \nconcerns of your employees. We need him to make significant changes to \ntransform the Agency to the gold standard it once was.\n  FDA sets the gold standard. Yet today we have ideology over science, \nideology over competence. I strongly believe the FDA needs a strong \npermanent Director. I will therefore vote for Andrew Von Eschenbach in \nthe hopes that he can become that strong leader FDA needs and the \nAmerican public deserves.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at 5:45, in just 15 minutes, we will have \nan opportunity to vote on the nominee to head the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I want to first of all commend my friend, the chairman \nof our human resource committee, Senator Enzi, for his leadership over \nthis period of time in giving the assurance to the agency, and much \nmore importantly to the American people, that we are going to have \nsomeone in charge of this agency able to exercise executive decisions, \nto make sure the agency itself is going to fulfill its role in \nprotecting the health of the American people. So first of all, I thank \nmy colleague and friend, Senator Enzi, for making sure we are going to \nget an opportunity to vote.\n  I thank the majority leader, Senator Frist, for making sure that we \nwere not going to leave this session without having a final vote on the \nnominee.\n  In the last 5 years, only in one of those years did we have a head of \nthe FDA. The rest of the time, they were ``acting.'' A good deal of the \ntime, there was virtually no presence. This is the most important \nhealth agency that guides and guards American's health, the health of \nour children, the health of the elderly, and the health of families in \nour Nation. So this is a very important point, and I welcome the \nopportunity to urge the Senate to approve Andrew von Eschenbach for \nthis position.\n  As I mentioned, the Food and Drug Administration oversees the \nproducts that account for fully a quarter of the entire U.S. economy. \nEvery day, the agency makes decisions that mean the difference between \nlife and death for countless patients. Millions of Americans rely on \ndrugs the FDA approves to protect them from sickness, and every family \nin America counts on the FDA to see that the food they eat is free from \ncontamination.\n  Now we are in the life science century, and the opportunities for \nbreakthroughs with new drugs is unlimited. With the progress we have \nmade in the Human Genome Project and the sequencing of the genes, the \nresearch that is being done across this Nation, the possibilities are \nvirtually unlimited. But it is all new science. We have to make sure \nthat this agency which is going to make the judgments and decisions \nabout approval or disapproval is going to have the best in terms of \nscientists, the best in terms of leadership. That is at issue here if \nwe do not have someone who is going to be the head of the FDA to make \nsure the agency that has responsibility for the safety of prescription \ndrugs is going to work in ways to protect the American consumer; that \nthe agency that is in charge of the food safety in this country is \ngoing to work to ensure that it is going to be effective for the \nAmerican people.\n  Now the agency itself, the FDA, urgently needs treatment. For too \nlong, it has been without a confirmed leader. It has become a ship \nwithout a captain, lacking the initiative and confidence that only a \nconfirmed commissioner can bring. Year after year, under this \nadministration, the FDA has been allowed to drift, and year after year \nthe challenges that face the agency have grown.\n  Think of the controversies--about antidepressants, about the \nwithdrawal of Vioxx, about the sale of Plan B over the counter, about \nadequate review of drugs on the market. The agency has had to struggle \nunfairly with difficult scientific questions, inadequate resources and \nauthority, and political pressures to ignore the science that must be--\ngood science has to be at the heart of its mission.\n  Finally, the day is here when the Senate can act to confirm a \ncommissioner whose job No. 1 will be to restore the leadership to this \nessential agency and begin the process of addressing the many major \nconcerns that have gone unmet for so long.\n  Dr. von Eschenbach is a good choice to lead the FDA. At the National \nCancer Institute, he led bold initiatives on the human genome and \nnanotechnology. As a physician for patients with cancer and a survivor \nof cancer himself, he brought an indispensable patient-centered \nperspective to the Cancer Institute, and he will bring that to the Food \nand Drug Administration as well.\n  Dr. von Eschenbach was able to find a solution to the controversy \nabout allowing the over-the-counter sales of Plan B. We may never know \nthe battles he had to fight and win to achieve that solution, but his \nintegrity and tenacity in achieving a solution speak volumes for his \ncharacter and his commitment to public health.\n  FDA has long been regarded as the gold standard in regulatory work. \nThat will continue to be true only if it makes independent, science-\nbased decisions, in both fact and appearance, and under Dr. von \nEschenbach's leadership, we expect FDA to make those discussions solely \non the basis of science and in the best interests of public health. To \ndo the job we expect----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask, if there is no objection, that I be able to \nproceed for another 4 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have to make sure the agency itself is \ngoing to have the adequate resources that are going to be necessary to \nprotect the public interest. What we are talking about here is making \nsure they have the best, in terms of science--in terms of prescription \ndrugs and the new breakthroughs. We have the whole range of new medical \ndevices which are out there. The United States is leading the way. We \nwant to make sure they are safe and effective. The agency has important \nresponsibilities in terms of the safety of our food supply. We have \ngiven it additional kinds of responsibilities to deal with the \nchallenges of the war on terror.\n  This agency has enormous responsibilities in terms of the consumers \nand the families of this Nation. It needs the strong leadership which I \nthink the nominee can bring, and it needs the kind of support from the \nCongress that\n\n[[Page S11450]]\n\nwill permit it to be the true gold standard for safety and for \nimproving the health of the American people.\n  As other agencies are set up around the world--in Western Europe and \nnow even in Asia--the place they look is at the FDA, and for very good \nreason. We want this agency to be the best. It can be the best. With a \nnew leader and hopefully with the new Congress giving the agency the \nkind of support it should have, we can make sure the health of the \nAmerican people in these important areas is going to be secure for the \nfuture.\n  Again, I thank my friend and colleague from Wyoming for his \npersistence and tenacity in making sure where we are this evening. We \nwould not be here if it had not been for his good work on this issue, \nas in so many others. I thank him, and the American people ought to \nknow that this is an enormously important vote to protect their \ninterests. I hope this nominee is approved overwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, for his tremendous effort over the last 2 years as we have \nworked on health issues but particularly as we have worked on the FDA. \nThe Food and Drug Administration is critical to the people of this \ncountry, and Senator Kennedy and I have been asking to have a fully \nconfirmed person heading that up every opportunity we have had. We have \nbeen reminding people they did not want to be the one objecting if \nthere happened to be a national safety crisis in food or health. It is \njust so critical.\n  People say he is ``acting.'' When you are the acting person in a \nposition, you really do not have the authority. It means people are \nlooking over your shoulder, seeing what you are doing, making sure you \nare dotting every ``I'' and crossing every ``t'' and following every \nrule and listening to every agency that has any control over you. \nSomeone who is fully confirmed can be the boss.\n  A lot of people would say: Why would this highly qualified doctor \ntake this job?\n  I am sure now that he has been through the confirmation process, he \nis probably thinking: Why I would take that job? I am hoping he is not. \nIn fact, earlier today I called him to let him know that the delay in \ngetting a final vote on his confirmation had nothing to do with him, \nthat we had some other logistical process things we were going through, \nthat there would be a final vote today, and that I suspected, in light \nof the cloture vote, there would not be any problem. I am pleased that \nit still looks that way. I am anxious to call him and let him know he \nis fully confirmed as a commissioner and he can start to work on some \nof the morale problems that he talked about, can start to work on some \nof the other vision things he has in mind, and people will know he has \nthe full authority to do that.\n  I do want to remind people that the FDA's mission is broad. It \nregulates food, it regulates drugs, it regulates biologics--and I wish \nI had time to explain all of what that is--medical devices. You \nprobably didn't know that he handles animal feed, and that is because \nanimals are ingested and could cause a problem, too. He is also in \ncharge of cosmetics. For every dollar Americans spend, this agency \nregulates 25 cents of that dollar in products.\n  As science progresses, the challenges to regulation will grow. The \nFDA regulates a host of new products that blur the FDA's traditional \nboundaries, and that is one of the reasons the Senator from \nMassachusetts and I have been working on a FDA reform bill for a year \nand a half. We have now held hearings on that.\n  It is a very bipartisan bill. We have had some outstanding comments. \nThere is a possibility to make the agency better, and we are going to \ncontinue to work on that so that all the new innovations that require a \nnimble and responsive agency to regulate them, and resources to match, \nwill be in place so that he can do the kind of job he needs to do.\n  This is such a critical role in our Nation's public health, it is \nsuch an important agency, I do ask for people to give him a resounding \nvote in this confirmation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Kennedy, who is the ranking member on the \ncommittee and soon to be the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions Committee, for his hard work and support during the \nprocess. I think it is time to bring this process to a close so we can \nget him confirmed as quickly as possible and have a true, fully \nconfirmed Commissioner of Food and Drug.\n  I thank Dr. von Eschenbach for his patience with our process and for \nthe work he has done in spite of the process. I look forward to getting \nto see the kind of job he will do as a fully confirmed physician. I ask \nfor your vote in support of him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, in a couple of minutes we are going to turn \nto a very important vote, a vote that to me is significant because it \ntouches every single American in some shape or form. Much has been said \nover the course of today about the scope of the FDA, the importance of \nhaving an FDA Commissioner, a permanent FDA Commissioner, and we will \nrealize that shortly.\n  Earlier this year we celebrated the 100th anniversary of the Food and \nDrug Administration, which is an administration that I have used \nprofessionally in my previous profession in everything from the \nthousands of prescriptions I have written, to investigational drugs, to \nleft ventricular devices, to lasers and artificial hearts. I have seen \nfirst hand how important it is to have an appropriate regulatory agency \nthere. The Food and Drug Administration, as we all know, as we have \nsaid this afternoon, is America's first scientific regulation body. \nWhile the agency has adapted and changed with the times, it has \nremained true to its purpose of protecting interests of everyone who is \nlistening to me, the American consumer.\n  In a few minutes we will vote on the nomination of a very good \nfriend, Dr. Eschenbach, to the position of Commissioner of the Food and \nDrug Administration.\n  I have known Dr. Eschenbach, again professionally, and I have had \nmutual patients with him. And he has assisted in many ways as we have \nlooked at appropriate therapy for individuals from across the country. \nHe is currently serving as Acting Commissioner. I have interacted with \nhim in that regard. He has demonstrated a capacity to lead and to \nadminister in an exceptional way the Food and Drug Administration with \nsensitive issues on a daily basis. It is important that we have a \npermanent person in that position, and he is the ideal person, the \nideal candidate to do just that.\n  In both his professional and personal life, Dr. Eschenbach has \nexperience: as a cancer survivor, as Director of the National Cancer \nInstitute, literally a nationally renowned urologic surgeon and \noncologist, which all attest to the superlative qualifications to \nhandle that challenging job, as we all know, as FDA Commissioner.\n  I hope colleagues will join me in supporting Dr. Eschenbach's \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Andrew von Eschenbach, of Texas, to be Commissioner of Food and \nDrugs, Department of Health and Human Services?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know it is probably appropriate to speak \nof our colleagues, and I will do that on the record. I rise tonight, \nhowever, to speak about a subject heavy on my mind. It is the subject \nof the war in Iraq.\n  I have never worn the uniform of my country. I am not a soldier or a \nveteran. I regret that fact. It is one of the regrets of my life. But I \nam a student of history, particularly military history, and it is that \nperspective which I brought to the Senate 10 years ago as a newly \nelected Member of this Chamber.\n  When we came to the vote on Iraq, it was an issue of great moment for \nme. No issue is more difficult to vote on than war and peace, because \nit involves the lives of our soldiers, our young men and women. It \ninvolves the expenditure of our treasure, putting on the line the \nprestige of our country. It is not a vote taken lightly. I have tried \nto be a good soldier in this Chamber. I have tried to support our \nPresident, believing at the time of the vote on the war in Iraq that we \nhad been given good intelligence and knowing that Saddam Hussein was a \nmenace to the world, a brutal dictator, a tyrant by any standard, and \none who threatened our country in many different ways, through the \nfinancing and fomenting of terrorism. For those reasons and believing \nthat we would find weapons of mass destruction, I voted aye.\n  I have been rather silent on this question ever since. I have been \nrather quiet because, when I was visiting Oregon troops in Kirkuk in \nthe Kurdish area, the soldiers said to me: Senator, don't tell me you \nsupport the troops and not our mission. That gave me pause. But since \nthat time, there have been 2,899 American casualties. There have been \nover 22,000 American men and women wounded. There has been an \nexpenditure of $290 billion a figure that approaches the expenditure we \nhave every year on an issue as important as Medicare. We have paid a \nprice in blood and treasure that is beyond calculation by my \nestimation.\n  Now, as I witness the slow undoing of our efforts there, I rise to \nspeak from my heart. I was greatly disturbed recently to read a comment \nby a man I admire in history, one Winston Churchill, who after the \nBritish mandate extended to the peoples of Iraq for 5 years, wrote to \nDavid Lloyd George, Prime Minister of England:\n\n       At present we are paying 8 millions a year for the \n     privilege of living on an ungrateful volcano.\n\n  When I read that, I thought, not much has changed. We have to learn \nthe lessons of history and sometimes they are painful because we have \nmade mistakes.\n  Even though I have not worn the uniform of my country, I, with other \ncolleagues here, love this Nation. I came into politics because I \nbelieved in some things. I am unusually proud of the fact of our recent \nhistory, the history of our Nation since my own birth. At the end of \nthe Second World War, there were 15 nations on earth that could be \ncounted as democracies that you and I would recognize. Today there are \n150 nations on earth that are democratic and free. That would not have \nhappened had the United States been insular and returned to our \nisolationist roots, had we laid down the mantle of world leadership, \nhad we not seen the importance of propounding and encouraging the \nspread of democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and the values of \nour Bill of Rights. It is a better world because of the United States \nof America, and the price we have paid is one of blood and treasure.\n  Now we come to a great crossroads. A commission has just done some, I \nsuppose, good work. I am still evaluating it. I welcome any ideas now \nbecause where we are leaves me feeling much like Churchill, that we are \npaying the price to sit on a mountain that is little more than a \nvolcano of ingratitude.\n  Yet as I feel that, I remember the pride I felt when the statue of \nSaddam Hussein came down. I remember the thrill I felt when three times \nIraqis risked their own lives to vote democratically in a way that was \ninternationally verifiable as well as legitimate and important. Now all \nof those memories seem much like ashes to me.\n\n  The Iraq Study Group has given us some ideas. I don't know if they \nare good or not. It does seem to me that it is a recipe for retreat. It \nis not cut and run, but it is cut and walk. I don't know that that is \nany more honorable than cutting and running, because cutting and \nwalking involves greater expenditure of our treasure, greater loss of \nAmerican lives.\n  Many things have been attributed to George Bush. I have heard him on \nthis floor blamed for every ill, even the weather. But I do not believe \nhim to be a liar. I do not believe him to be a traitor, nor do I \nbelieve all the bravado and the statements and the accusations made \nagainst him. I believe him to be a very idealistic man. I believe him \nto have a stubborn backbone. He is not guilty of perfidy, but I do \nbelieve he is guilty of believing bad intelligence and giving us the \nsame.\n  I can't tell you how devastated I was to learn that in fact we were \nnot going to find weapons of mass destruction. But remembering the \nwords of the soldier--don't tell me you support the troops but you \ndon't support my mission--I felt the duty to continue my support. Yet I \nbelieve the President is guilty of trying to win a short war and not \nunderstanding fully the nature of the ancient hatreds of the Middle \nEast. Iraq is a European creation. At the Treaty of Versailles, the \nvictorious powers put together Kurdish, Sunni, and Shia tribes that had \nbeen killing each other for time immemorial. I would like to think \nthere is an Iraqi identity. I would like to remember the purple fingers \nraised high. But we can not want democracy for Iraq more than they want \nit for themselves. And what I find now is that our tactics there have \nfailed.\n  Again, I am not a soldier, but I do know something about military \nhistory. And what that tells me is when you are engaged in a war of \ninsurgency, you can't clear and leave. With few exceptions, throughout \nIraq that is what\n\n[[Page S11452]]\n\nwe have done. To fight an insurgency often takes a decade or more. It \ntakes more troops than we have committed. It takes clearing, holding, \nand building so that the people there see the value of what we are \ndoing. They become the source of intelligence, and they weed out the \ninsurgents. But we have not cleared and held and built. We have cleared \nand left, and the insurgents have come back.\n  I, for one, am at the end of my rope when it comes to supporting a \npolicy that has our soldiers patrolling the same streets in the same \nway, being blown up by the same bombs day after day. That is absurd. It \nmay even be criminal. I cannot support that anymore. I believe we need \nto figure out how to fight the war on terror and to do it right. So \neither we clear and hold and build, or let's go home.\n  There are no good options, as the Iraq Study Group has mentioned in \ntheir report. I am not sure cutting and walking is any better. I have \nlittle confidence that the Syrians and the Iranians are going to be \nserious about helping us to build a stable and democratic Iraq. I am at \na crossroads as well. I want my constituents to know what is in my \nheart, what has guided my votes.\n  What will continue to guide the way I vote is simply this: I do not \nbelieve we can retreat from the greater war on terror. Iraq is a \nbattlefield in that larger war. But I do believe we need a presence \nthere on the near horizon at least that allows us to provide \nintelligence, interdiction, logistics, but mostly a presence to say to \nthe murderers that come across the border: We are here, and we will \ndeal with you. But we have no business being a policeman in someone \nelse's civil war.\n  I welcome the Iraq Study Group's report, but if we are ultimately \ngoing to retreat, I would rather do it sooner than later. I am looking \nfor answers, but the current course is unacceptable to this Senator. I \nsuppose if the President is guilty of one other thing, I find it also \nin the words of Winston Churchill. He said:\n\n       After the First World War, let us learn our lessons. Never, \n     never believe that any war will be smooth and easy or that \n     anyone who embarks on this strange voyage can measure the \n     tides and the hurricanes. The statesman who yields to war \n     fever must realize that once the signal is given, he is no \n     longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable \n     and uncontrollable events.\n  That is a lesson we are learning again. I am afraid, rather than \nleveling with the American people and saying this was going to be a \ndecade-long conflict because of the angst and hatred that exists in \nthat part of the world, that we tried to win it with too few troops in \ntoo fast a time. Lest anyone thinks I believe we have failed \nmilitarily, please understand I believe when President Bush stood in \nfront of ``mission accomplished'' on an aircraft carrier that, in \npurely military terms, the mission was accomplished in the wars in \nAfghanistan and Iraq. But winning a battle, winning a war, is different \nthan winning a peace.\n  We were not prepared to win the peace by clearing, holding, and \nbuilding. You don't do that fast and you don't do it with too few \ntroops. I believe now that we must either determine to do that, or we \nmust redeploy in a way that allows us to continue to prosecute the \nlarger war on terror. It will not be pretty. We will pay a price in \nworld opinion. But I, for one, am tired of paying the price of 10 or \nmore of our troops dying a day. So let's cut and run, or cut and walk, \nor let us fight the war on terror more intelligently than we have, \nbecause we have fought this war in a very lamentable way.\n  Those are my feelings. I regret them. I would have never voted for \nthis conflict had I reason to believe that the intelligence we had was \nnot accurate. It was not accurate, but that is history. Now we must \nfind a way to make the best of a terrible situation, at a minimum of \nloss of life for our brave fighting men and women. So I will be looking \nfor every opportunity to clear, build, hold, and win or how to bring \nour troops home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11452-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11452-S11453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CHRISTMAS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Sir Walter Scott, in his poem ``Marmion,'' \nsaid these words:\n\n     Heap on more wood!--the wind is chill;\n     But let it whistle as it will,\n     We'll keep our Christmas merry still.\n\n  The Senate will shortly adjourn for the remainder of the year. We \nwill return home to our families and friends and begin to think of \nputting up Christmas decorations and shopping for those special \npresents that we will give to our loved ones. We will leave much work \nunfinished, postponed until the new Congress convenes next January. \nThat I regret.\n  Continuing resolutions allow the basic work of Government to proceed, \nbut they do not offer clear guidance to Government offices and \nprograms, and they postpone any new starts or major changes to programs \nuntil the regular authorizing and appropriation bills are acted upon. \nThat is unfortunate. However, we may be grateful this Christmas that we \nlive in a nation in which changes in Government may take place in a \npeaceful fashion in open elections. We may also be grateful that we \nlive in a nation in which the voice of the people can be expressed \nfreely, eloquently, and peacefully. Vox populi, vox diae. This \nChristmas, we might alter our prayers for those around the world who do \nnot enjoy these same great blessings.\n  Christmastime is a time of peace and celebrating, as Christians do, \nthe birth of Jesus, whose world-transforming message preached peace, \ntolerance, kindness, and love for all people. I am not quite sure where \nthe message to shop, spend, and wrap presents came from, for it is \nsurely not in the Bible, nor in the teachings of Jesus. These days, it \ntakes effort to carve out enough time and energy from the ceaseless \nmarch of consumerism to find the true spirit of Christmas. But, \nthankfully, it is still present amid all the bright lights and cheery \nbackground music. One can see it in the piles of canned goods donated \nto food banks. One can see it in the response to the ``angel trees'' \nthat let people answer the Christmas wishes of children in their \ncommunities. One can hear it in the Christmas choirs that put on \nmagnificent performances. ``At Christmas play and make good cheer, for \nChristmas comes but once a year.'' So wrote Thomas Tusser, who lived \nfrom 1524 to 1580, demonstrating that some good things have changed \nvery little over the years.\n  For the birth of Jesus, the angels sang, and for Him in this cold \nseason, churches across the Nation will be filled with joyous music. \nThe churches of West Virginia are always filled with great music, but \nat Christmastime the choirs are especially inspired. There are few \nthings more uplifting than coming out of an evening church service, \nbuoyed up by sweet traditional music, and seeing the stars of heaven \nsparkling like diamonds across the velvet dark sky. All of the carols \nthat we learned as children in church, or around the family piano, sing \nin our heads, don't they? The three kings following the ``yonder \nstar,'' the stars shining brightly on that holy night, the manger in \nBethlehem, and the holy mother and child on that silent night. Each \nyear, these loving memories surface from the deep well of our \nchildhood, each time bringing with them fond memories of happy days and \nfamily members no longer with us but still very dear to our hearts.\n  This year, many families will look to the stars to know that far \nacross the globe their loved ones also gaze up at the same stars to \nrecall home and to recall the same old Christmas story. In Afghanistan, \nin Iraq, in Korea and Kosovo, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and elsewhere \naround the globe, many thousands of U.S. troops will be spending this \nChristmas season in a decidedly unpeaceful setting, proudly and bravely \nwearing the uniforms of this Nation. The National Guard units of West \nVirginia will have done and will continue to do their part, serving \nrepeated deployments--I say again, serving repeated deployments--\noverseas. Many of them will not be able to spend Christmas with their \nfamilies. For our troops especially, we pray for peace, that they might \nbe soon returned to the loving arms of their families. And to the \nfamilies of our service men and women, we offer words, hopefully, of \ncomfort, assuring them that none of us can forget that during this \nholiday season their loved ones are far from home--far from home and \nfar from safety. Our prayers and our wishes are with them always.\n\n[[Page S11453]]\n\n     My soul, there is a country\n     Far beyond the stars,\n     Where stands a winged sentry\n     All skillful in the wars:\n     There above noise and danger,\n     Sweet Peace is crown'd with smiles,\n     And One born in a manger\n     Commands the beauteous files.\n\n  Henry Vaughn in 1650 wrote those words in his poem titled ``Peace.''\n  Mr. President, I wish everyone in our Nation and everyone in our \nNation's service around the globe a beautiful and peaceful Christmas \nseason. Wherever the demands of the Nation may send you, in your hearts \nand in your memories you can hear the music and relive the family \ntraditions that make Christmas so very, very special.\n  As this year closes and a new year dawns, we are filled with kind \nthoughts and bold resolutions. For some, it would be a time also filled \nwith a certain buyer's remorse, as the Christmas bills come due. For \nothers, New Year's resolutions will lead them into gymnasiums in fresh \nattempts to exercise and work off rich Christmas cookies and cakes. I \napplaud everyone with such determination. Each new year is a new chance \nto address our pressing individual issues, be they health related or \neconomic.\n  The new Congress must also be filled with resolve--resolve to respond \nto the clear messages sent by the people of the United States. We will \nhave much work to do if we are to successfully deal with the situation \nin the Middle East, the mounting national deficit at home, the rising \ncosts of health care, and myriad other problems. Our resolve must last \nlonger than most introductory gymnasium memberships if we are to set \nour national house in order.\n  In January, Lord willing, I will begin my ninth term as a United \nStates Senator from the beautiful State of West Virginia, whose motto \nis ``Mountaineers are always free.'' I have been here long enough to \nknow that we have done it before, and we can do it again. I again thank \nthe people of West Virginia for their votes of confidence in me, Robert \nC. Byrd, to continue in their service.\n  Mr. President, I close with a favorite poem of mine by James Henry \nLeigh Hunt, who lived from 1784 to 1859. This is a poem familiar to all \nof us, to me from my very earliest days in a little two-room \nschoolhouse. This favorite poem of mine by James Henry Leigh Hunt is \nentitled ``Abou Ben Adhem.'' During the Christmas season, and \nespecially as we brave the crowds and the traffic at the shopping malls \nand in the grocery stores, it is good to remember that the true message \nof the season is to love the Lord and to love our fellow men.\n  ``Abou Ben Adhem'':\n\n     Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)\n     Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,\n     And saw, within the moonlight in his room,\n     Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,\n     An Angel writing in a book of gold:\n\n     Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,\n     And to the Presence in the room he said,\n     ``What writest thou?'' The Vision raised its head,\n     And with a look made of all sweet accord\n     Answered, ``The names of those who love the Lord.''\n\n     ``And is mine one?'' said Abou. ``Nay, not so,''\n     Replied the Angel. Abou spoke more low,\n     But cheerily still; and said, ``I pray thee, then,\n     Write me as one who loves his fellow men.''\n\n     The Angel wrote, and vanished. The next night\n     It came again with a great wakening light,\n     And showed the names whom love of God had blessed,\n     And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest!\n\n  Mr. President, I wish you and I wish all Senators and all peoples \neverywhere a very merry and peaceful and pleasant and memorable \nChristmas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I say to my neighbor in West Virginia, my \nfriend and my colleague, first of all, that the poem he just recited is \none that my wife Frances and I learned in the seventh grade in Yellow \nSprings. The Senator reciting it brings back very good memories, not \nonly of the poem but of being in the seventh grade with my friends.\n  There will be many things about this Senate that I will miss, and \ncertainly one that I will miss is having the opportunity to sit here \nand to listen to my colleague from West Virginia as he speaks. It is a \ngreat privilege. It is a great thrill.\n  I must tell him, however, that there is C-SPAN in Cedarville, OH. I \nsuspect the library does get the Congressional Record at Cedarville \nCollege and other places, so I will have the opportunity to listen to \nhim and read what he has to say. He is a great treasure of this Senate.\n  I might also tell my colleague, as I told him personally yesterday, \nthat I will carry around with me and keep with me and prize the small \nConstitution that I know is in his pocket right now that he gave me. I \ndeeply appreciate that. And I know he gave one to the Presiding Officer \nas well.\n  One of the first things I did when I came to the Senate in January of \n1995 was walk across the hall to see Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd was \nkind enough to give me his ``History of the Senate.'' I have cherished \nthat, have read it. That will be going back with Frances and myself to \nOhio. If I do, I say to my colleague from West Virginia, do what I hope \nto do--do a little teaching at the college level--I am sure those books \nwill certainly come in very handy.\n  I thank my colleague for his friendship and for his great service now \nbeginning this January his ninth term in the Senate.\n  One final note. I will tell my colleague, and I don't know if I have \ntold him this, but my son and my daughter-in-law and our new \ngranddaughter now live in West Virginia, so they are constituents of my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank this friend of West Virginia, this friend of mine. \nI shall always remember as long as I live--however long that may be--I \nshall carry in my heart a very warm feeling for him. He is our \nneighbor. He represents the people of Ohio, our neighbor to the west of \nthe West Virginia hills. I thank him for his friendship and for his \nservices to his people. His people are my people. I wish him well in \nthe days and years ahead wherever he may serve. May God always bless \nyou, my friend, and may He always keep you in the palm of His hand.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague for his very generous and kind \ncomments. One final comment to say that it was his great leadership, \nalong with the great leadership of Senator McCain and others, which \nallowed us--group is the word I would prefer--a group of 14 Senators to \nmake an agreement that I think was in the best interests of the Senate, \nand it has proved to be in the best interests of the Senate, in regard \nto our judges and how we confirm them. It has worked so far. My wish \nfor you and my other colleagues as you go on is that you will continue \nto keep that agreement and it will continue to work. That is my wish.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator. I shall do my best \nto help fulfill his confidence and wishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11453-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11453-S11462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                    Sergeant Daniel Michael Shepherd\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ncourageous young man, who dedicated his life to defending the freedom \nof others. Army SGT Daniel Michael Shepherd of Elyria, OH was killed in \nIraq on August 15, 2004, when his vehicle was struck by a bomb. He was \nonly 23 years old.\n  Daniel--fondly referred to as ``Danny'' by his family and friends--\nwas deployed to support Operation Iraqi Freedom in September 2003, \nafter being stationed at Fort Riley in Kansas. Danny joined the \nmilitary in 2000, upon his graduation from high school. A courageous \nmember of the 1st Battalion, 16th infantry regiment, 1st Brigade, Danny \nwas remembered as a committed soldier and loyal friend.\n  His platoon SGT Ron Tulanowski remembers Danny's reliability and \nbravery when the Sergeant's armored vehicle was hit by a grenade. In \ndescribing Danny's heroism, the Sergeant said that ``he probably saved \nmy life the day I got hit.'' Danny was more concerned for the lives of \nothers than he was for his own. I can think of nothing more honorable.\n  Danny attended Columbia High School where he played center and tight \nend on the school's football team. He was known as a great athlete and \ndevoted team player. According to Ray Anthony, the Columbia Township \nFire Chief, ``Danny was like the big brother\n\n[[Page S11454]]\n\nof the football team.'' One of Danny's former teammates Mike Banyasz \nalso recalled how helpful he was to all his teammates. ``He was \nstarting center and I was backup center,'' he said.\n\n       By the third game, he moved to tight end, and I became \n     starting center. He helped me out a lot. He was a big reason \n     I became the starter.\n\n  Clearly, Danny believed in the value of teamwork. His willingness to \nalways help others be their best made him a truly excellent soldier.\n  It was also in high school, Mr. President, that Danny met his future \nwife Kassie for whom he cared deeply. While Danny was in Iraq, Kassie \nwaited anxiously for him at home; she missed her husband terribly.\n  Kassie gave birth to their son, Daniel A. Shepherd, while Danny was \ndeployed in Iraq. Daniel was born on St. Patrick's Day and according to \nfamily members and friends, looks just like his father. Danny was \nscheduled to return from Iraq a week after he died. He was looking \nforward to meeting his son for the first time. When Danny died, his son \nwas only six months old.\n  Recognized for his unrelenting drive, Danny simply had a passion for \npublic service. He attended law enforcement classes at Lorain County \nJoint Vocational School and planned on contributing to the safety of \nhis community by becoming a police officer upon his return from Iraq. \nAnd according to his grandmother Celia, ``Danny understood the value of \neducation and planned on attending college upon his return.''\n  Friends and family members were inspired by Danny's motivation and \npositive attitude. He went about his busy and stressful days with an \ninfectious smile on his face. Danny's former teammate Chris Horn said:\n\n       Danny's daily schedule was always hectic, yet I never heard \n     him gripe or complain.\n\n  Indeed, Danny's optimism shined through to his peers as he worked to \nreach his goals. According to Chris, Danny ``seemed like he knew what \nhe wanted to do from the get-go. He said he wanted to be in the \nmilitary and then when he got out, he wanted to become a cop.''\n  Danny's family and friends are frequently reminded of his character, \nreliability, and willingness to help others. Roger Pace--the minister \nat Broadview Road Church who delivered Danny's eulogy--said that ``the \nArmy calls such people leaders, regardless of rank.'' Indeed, Danny \nShepherd epitomizes the definition of leadership.\n  SGT Andrew Ritchie of New York--who had served in an earlier \ndeployment with Danny--reiterated this characteristic. This is what he \nsaid:\n\n       Shepherd was one of the best people I ever had the chance \n     to meet and serve with in the Army. . . . He always did [his \n     job] to the best of his ability. He would always stop to help \n     somebody else out when they needed it. All I can really say \n     is he was a great person.\n\n  Danny will leave a lasting impact on everyone he met. His former next \ndoor neighbor, Jennifer, reflected upon the sadness she felt when she \nheard of his death. She wrote the following on an Internet tribute \nwebpage:\n\n       So much pain rushed through me all at once because I knew \n     that I would never get to see `the boy next door' again. The \n     pain did not last too long, though, because I soon realized \n     that though Danny's physical presence will no longer be \n     there, his love and memories will never falter.\n\n  Mr. President, Danny Shepherd's heroic actions and service to our \ncountry will be honored and remembered long after his death. His \noptimism will continue to inspire those who knew and loved him.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Danny's family--his wife Kassie, \ntheir son Daniel, and Danny's parents Karen and Daniel--in our thoughts \nand prayers.\n\n\n                  Private First Class Adam R. Shepherd\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army PFC Adam R. \nShepherd from Somerville, OH. On January 17, 2006, PFC Shepherd died in \nIraq from an illness. He was serving with the 2nd Battalion, 502nd \nInfantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, \nbased out of Fort Campbell, KY. Adam was 21 years old.\n  Adam leaves his mother and step-father Susan and Mark Miller, his \nfather Roger Shepherd, and his brothers Marcus Miller, Elijah Miller, \nand Army SPC Joshua Shepherd, who also is serving with the 2nd Brigade.\n  Adam was born in Cincinnati on Christmas Day 1984. Growing up, he \nattended Preble Shawnee High School until he transferred to the Life \nSkills Center for his senior year. He graduated in 2002, and enlisted \nin the Army in January 2003. As an infantryman, Adam's relatives say \nthat his superiors in the Army regularly praised him for his positive \nattitude and for always volunteering for dangerous duties.\n  Hector Santiago, one of Adam's school teachers, remembers him as a \n``very good student. . . . He was an even-keeled, happy-go-lucky type \nof guy,'' he said. Those who grew up with Adam remember him as a real \njokester. He always had something funny to say and was always trying to \nmake his friends smile. For many, he was simply a ray of sunshine in \ntheir lives. As one of his friends, J.J. Green, said, ``We had a blast \nevery time we got together. He was always the generous, happy person in \nour group of friends. I will miss him forever.''\n  Adam will also be remembered for his politeness and compassion. He \nwas the type of person who was always looking to make new friends. \nJaneese Martin wrote the following on an Internet tribute webpage in \nAdam's honor:\n\n       I was very shocked and saddened to hear of Adam's death. He \n     was a very wonderful person. He befriended me when I moved to \n     Preble Shawnee--no questions asked. I was very proud of him \n     when I heard that he served his country.\n\n  Adam's sense of humor and ability to make others laugh followed him \nto Iraq, where his fellow soldiers found in him a good friend--someone \nwho could brighten any day. SGT T. Gonzales left Adam's family the \nfollowing message in tribute to Adam:\n\n       I was fortunate to make the acquaintance of this fine \n     soldier, as well as that of his brother . . . during the \n     first trip to Iraq in 2003 to 2004. Adam was always one with \n     jokes in his mind and has shown me the lighter side of life. \n     . . . He will be greatly missed! My heart, prayers, and \n     thoughts go with all of you.\n\n  PFC Dennis Bluhm had this to say about his friend:\n\n       [O]ne thing I can tell you is that Adam made an impact on \n     everyone he talked to. He has always been able to find a way \n     to make someone laugh, even when they wanted to cry. He was \n     one of the BEST friends that anyone could ever have the \n     privilege of growing up next door to. Adam is not gone--he \n     lives on in all of our memories, and with a guy like him . . \n     . he will definitely not be forgotten.\n\n  Adam was a loving son and brother. His family dearly misses him. As \nhis mother Susan said, ``I have four children--four boys--and a quarter \nof my heart is gone.''\n  Adam's Aunt Ruth wrote the following about her nephew:\n\n       Today is Valentine's Day--a time to remember those who you \n     love. I love Adam. I always will. He brings a smile to my \n     face everyday when I think of him. He was such a sweet boy \n     who turned into such a fine young man. My heart goes out to \n     his mother, who will always be my friend and sister. . . . I \n     recall the saying, `It matters not how much we love, but how \n     much we are loved.' And Adam was so very loved--'till we meet \n     again, Adam.\n\n  Adam will always be remembered for his warm, beaming smile. From the \nday he was born, as his Aunt Rose remembers that his smile just stood \nout--that it was truly unforgettable.\n  Adam was proud that he fulfilled his dream of becoming a soldier and \nserving our Nation. He was brave and dedicated. His service to our \ncountry has earned him several awards, including the Army Good Conduct \nMedal, the Army Service Ribbon, the Combat Infantryman Badge, the \nGlobal War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, and the National Defense Medal.\n  When I think of young men like Adam, I am reminded of the words of \nPresident John F. Kennedy. This is what he said:\n\n       Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, \n     that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any \n     hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the \n     survival and the success of liberty.\n\n  Without question, Adam served his country bravely to help ensure the \nsuccess of liberty. He was a man of courage and loyalty, devoted to his \nfamily, his fellow soldiers, and his country. But what's more, Adam \nserved cheerfully, and with a smile. Army PFC Adam Shepherd will never \nbe forgotten.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Adam's friends and family in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n[[Page S11455]]\n\n                 LANCE CORPORAL DANIEL NATHAN DEYARMIN\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to remember and honor a fellow Ohioan--\nMarine LCpl Daniel Nathan Deyarmin, Jr., from Tallmadge. Lance Corporal \nDeyarmin was killed on August 1, 2005, during combat operations in \nIraq. Just two days before his death, he celebrated his 22nd birthday. \nHe is survived by his parents Edie and Daniel Deyarmin Sr., and by his \nsister Erica.\n  To friends and family, Lance Corporal Deyarmin was known simply as \n``Nate.'' Born in Tallmadge, he lived there his whole life and loved to \ndress in cowboy outfits and tinker with old cars. Kind-hearted and \neasy-going, he was also a consummate prankster. Once, after cleaning \nhis room under orders, he then painted the following words on the \nceiling--``I got even!''\n  Nate's mother remembers that he could make anything fun. Even when he \nwas in trouble, his parents simply couldn't stay mad at him. It would \nnever be long until they were all laughing together.\n  His friends recall that Nate was friendly with everyone he met. He \nwas simply one of the guys, whether they were hunting, playing football \nor soccer, wrestling, or working on stock cars. Nate graduated in 2002 \nfrom Tallmadge High School, where he was a member of the football team.\n  Don Duffy was his school counselor for four years at Tallmadge High \nand remembers talking with the young Nate about his interest in the \nmilitary. He describes Nate as ``soft-spoken [and] polite,'' a good \nstudent who was well-liked by his fellow classmates.\n  Nate enlisted in the Marines in January 2003, one of five members of \nhis unit who graduated from the Tallmadge public schools. The group \nspoke twice to students at Tallmadge Middle School before shipping to \nIraq in January 2005. ``They felt very strongly about what they were \ndoing,'' Tallmadge teacher Carol Arbour said. ``We prayed they would be \ncoming home together.''\n  In Iraq, Nate became part of a special sniper unit. His mother \nremembers how important his fellow Marines were to him. ``He loved \nbeing with the snipers,'' she said. ``They worked together and they \nmeshed. They covered each other's butts.''\n  Nate's sister, Erica, also remembers his commitment to being a \nMarine. ``He believed in his country,'' she said. ``He loved being a \nMarine.''\n  During phone calls home, Nate's family had a rule that nothing \nnegative could ever be said during their phone conversations. His \nparents knew that being a sniper was a difficult job, and that Nate had \nto stay focused and alert at all times--even if he had gone without \nsleep for hours on end.\n  Nate was enthusiastic about many things in life, but cars were his \npassion. He would help friends whose cars broke down in the middle of \nthe night, and he loved to restore old cars. ``That was his favorite \nthing to do,'' Nate's sister recalls.\n  Family friend Ray Kozlowski described Nate as a ``horsepower \nenthusiast.'' With his father, he would work on old cars in the garage, \nwhere they kept a dozen cars in various states of disrepair. And Nate's \nfriend, Eddie Papp, remembers how focused he was when working. ``So \nmany times we would be working on something, and I would want to go to \nbed and get some sleep, but Nate would not let me,'' Eddie said. ``He \nwould make me push myself to go a little longer.''\n  During Nate's funeral procession, his family drove some of his \nfavorite cars. One of them was a 1985 Monte Carlo--a car that literally \nhad Nate's teething marks in the dashboard. Nate's friend Charlie \nHarner has painted the words ``In Loving Memory'' on the deck lid of \nhis own stock car. All of his races are dedicated to Nate.\n  Nate was a man who was devoted to his country, to his marines, and to \nhis family and friends. While serving in Iraq, he would often speak \nwith his family on the phone. Although the conversations were often \nemotional, he said he was proud of serving to make the country safe.\n  Nate's mother remembers that her son was upbeat when he called on his \n22nd birthday. ``He was happy,'' she said. ``He was always happy.''\n  Nate's death was felt by the entire Tallmadge community. He was \nhonored by Tallmadge High School during its first football game of the \n2005 season, and the sixth graders that Nate talked to at Tallmadge \nMiddle School will always remember the day that they heard a true hero \nspeak.\n  Nate was one of six men from his sniper unit to be killed on August \n1, 2005. SGT Brian Casagrande served with these men. This is what he \nsaid about Nate:\n\n       Daniel `Nate' Deyarmin came to us . . . from Weapons \n     Company. He brought with him his goofy smile and upbeat \n     spirit. His goofy exterior, which earned him the usual dose \n     of ribbings, contained the soul of a gentle, thoughtful man. \n     He was always willing to undertake any task set before him, \n     and did so without complaint or hesitation. He could be found \n     during his time off reading some kind of `motorhead' \n     magazine, and he was always talking specs about vehicles. \n     Nate's smile will be missed.\n\n  Nate's memory continues to inspire others. Working together with \nfamily friend Ray Kozlowski, Nate's mother has organized a fundraiser \nin her son's honor to benefit veterans with disabilities. Fittingly, \nthe fundraiser is based around what Nate loved most--horsepower.\n  On October 2, 2005, the LCpl Daniel ``Nate'' Deyarmin Memorial \nBenefit Run drew 1,500 motorcycles and 250 cars, successfully raising \nmore than $17,000 for the veterans. Another event was held this past \nsummer. In the past 2 years, Nate's mom has helped to raise over \n$35,000 for veterans with disabilities.\n  The life and heroism of Nathan Deyarmin will never be forgotten. He \nwas a fine man with a compassion for life and a dedication to his \nfamily, friends, community, and country. As his mother said, ``If you \ntruly knew Nathan, you loved him.''\n  I would like to conclude with words that Nate, himself, wrote in the \nAkron Beacon Journal. The article was published on July 4th, 2005, and \nNate wrote about being away from loved ones over the holiday, and what \nit meant to be defending his country with his fellow marines instead. \nThese were his words:\n\n       [T]he free will to be over here and help each other is one \n     of the hardest things in one's life and still being able to \n     put forth our best effort to make the best of every situation \n     we encounter. That's what we as Americans do. We make the \n     best of everything. Semper Fi.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep LCpl Nathan Deyarmin's family in \nour thoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                     Corporal Joseph Anthony Tomci\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to remember a brave Ohioan who died while \nserving our country in Iraq. Marine Cpl Joseph Anthony Tomci died on \nAugust 2, 2006, from wounds received from an IED explosion, while \nconducting combat operations against enemy forces. He leaves behind his \nmother and step-father Gayle and Philip, his father John, and his \nbrother Jason.\n  Joe--as friends and family called him--graduated from Stow-Monroe \nFalls High School in 2003 and immediately enlisted in the Marines. His \nfather remembers how proud Joe was to be serving his country. ``He felt \nthat they were doing something worthwhile,'' John recalled. ``He loved \nwhat he was doing. As a father, that's the highest thing that you can \nwant for your children.''\n  Joe's family and closest friends remember him as a sensitive man with \na deep sense of compassion. A family friend, Susan Walker, recalls the \ntime when a 10-year-old Joe unsuccessfully tried to nurse an abandoned \nmouse back to health. When the mouse died, she said, ``Joseph was \ndevastated.''\n  Joe was a young man with many interests. He will be remembered as a \nloyal friend, a comedian, and a Heineken beer drinker. He loved \nfootball and played on his high school team. Joe also loved movies and \nhad an amazing knack for memorizing lines from his favorite flicks. \nHe'd recite these lines while watching movies--often to the dismay of \nthose watching alongside him.\n  His lifelong friend Mike Gross remembers that Joe was ``the life of \nthe party.'' In Mike's words, ``It was always better when Joe was \naround.''\n  Indeed, Joe loved his friends. On his second tour in Iraq, he kept \npictures of his closest buddies in his helmet. And, after receiving \nnews of his death, more than a dozen of Joe's friends gathered to \nremember the man they knew as ``Joe Tom.'' They were lifelong friends, \nwho had played sports together as kids and had ridden their bikes \nthrough the streets of Stow. The even had a name for themselves--``The \nOrganization.''\n\n[[Page S11456]]\n\n  Friend, Steve Young, remembers that Joe would tell say that ``he was \nnot only serving his country, but he was serving us. He would tell us, \n`I am going so you don't have to.' ''\n  In addition to his strong sense of duty, Joe also had a remarkable \nsense of humor. To his friends, he was always something of a prankster. \nJacob Geopfert particularly remembers one night when they were all at \nhis family's lake house.\n  Without warning, their friend Nick sneezed three times in a row. Joe \nlooked at him and yelled, ``I don't get allergies, I give them.'' He \nthen pushed Nick--fully clothed--into the lake. ``That was Joe,'' Nick \nremembers. ``That's how he was.''\n  While serving abroad in Iraq, Joe became pen pals for a class of \nsecond graders at Fishcreek Elementary School in Stow. Teacher Tracy \nPiatt remembers how much corresponding with the young Marine in Iraq \nmeant to her class. They would make birthday cards and throw parties in \nhis honor, singing ``Happy Birthday'' to his picture that hung on their \nwall. They sent him care packages, and tracked his location in Iraq on \na map.\n  After his first tour ended, Joe visited the class, thanking them for \ntheir thoughtful letters. As he walked to the front of the room, they \nstopped and stared at him with awe and admiration. Joe talked to the \nclass about being an American and being a marine. He spoke of the \nimportance of respect, loyalty, faith, and trust. And, he told them \nthat their packages were one of his best motivations in Iraq, and that \nhe would sit there reading their letters for hours.\n  The students in Tracy Piatt's class will miss the young man who \nbecame their marine. ``He was so proud of what he was doing,'' Tracy \ntearfully remembers. ``You could tell he cared about making Iraq a \nbetter place for the people there.'' In her words:\n\n       [Joe] was a good kid, a good young man. He just wanted to \n     be good for people. I wish he knew how many people cared \n     about him. He touched so many lives that he didn't even know \n     about.\n\n  Tracy believes that having corresponded with Joe will make her \nstudents grow up to be better adults. I don't think there is anyone who \ncould disagree with that.\n  Nearly 1,000 people gathered inside the Holy Family Church to pay \ntheir final respects to Joe. Standing at the front of the church were \nthe boys and girls from Fishcreek Elementary. Their teacher Tracy spoke \nat the funeral. This is what she said:\n\n       As we look into the faces of these boys and girls, you're \n     looking at Joe Tomci, for he is in their hearts, and they \n     will carry him forever.\n\n  Also speaking at his funeral, Reverend Paul Rosing remembered Joe as \na true American hero. He said:\n\n       He fits the image of a classic hero. He's tall, good-\n     looking, and strong. He wanted to be a Marine since he was a \n     small child, and he went into the Marines as early as he \n     could.\n\n  Though Joe was nearing the end of his enlistment, his father believes \nthat his son was destined for a bright career in the military. Joe had \ntalked about the possibility of becoming a drill instructor, feeling \nthat his combat experience in Iraq would help him make better Marines \nout of new recruits. And it was Joe's nature to assume leadership \npositions. As his father said, ``In a sense, he'd be helping others. \nThat was kind of his life's mission.''\n  Joe made everyone who knew him proud. His mother remembers how \nimportant being a Marine was to Joe. ``He always dreamed of being a \nMarine,'' she said. ``He believed his service was a benefit to the \nworld.''\n  This sentiment is one we hear over and over again when people talk \nabout Joe's life. He was a caring man, someone who took his leadership \nresponsibilities seriously. He genuinely cared about the Marines who \nwere serving under him and worried about them often. During his last \ntour, he didn't call home as frequently as in the past. His mother \nexplains that Joe said ``it was because there were so many men under \nhis care that were on their first tour of duty that he wanted to make \nsure they'd have the opportunity to call home. That's just how he \nwas.''\n  Marine Cpl Joe Tomci was a young man who genuinely loved life and had \ngreat compassion for others. His dedication to his friends, family, \ncommunity, and country was unmatched. Joe is a model of what we all \nhope our children will become.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep his family in our thoughts and \nprayers.\n\n\n                      Sergeant Gary Andrew Eckert\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army SGT Gary Andrew \nEckert, from Sylvania, OH. On May 8, 2005, Sergeant Eckert died in Iraq \nwhen an improvised explosive device detonated near his military \nvehicle. He leaves behind his wife Tiphany, their daughter Marlee, and \ntheir son Myles. Sergeant Eckert is also survived by his mother \nDeborah, his father and step-mother Gary and Cathy, his brother Ryan, \nand his sisters Denise, Crystal, Jessica, Stephanie, and Alexandria. \nMr. President, Sergeant Eckert was 24 years old.\n  Family and friends referred to Gary as Andy, short for his middle \nname Andrew. They will remember Andy most for his courage, compassion, \nand dedication to his family. He was loved by all.\n  Andy graduated from Anthony Wayne High School in 2000, where he \nplayed on the basketball team during his freshman and sophomore years. \nAndy was a gifted athlete, someone for whom sports came easily. He was \na huge University of Michigan fan, but would still spend afternoons \ncheering on The Ohio State University Buckeyes with his friends.\n  That must have been an interesting time, particularly when Ohio \nplayed Michigan.\n  Andy was attending Owens Community College when his Army Reserves \nunit was called to active duty in February 2003. Without question, Andy \nwas a dedicated soldier. When he died, he was serving his second \ndeployment in Iraq. During his first deployment, he had sustained \ninjuries for which he received the Purple Heart. He was a courageous \nyoung man--a true hero.\n  During Andy's funeral, BG Michael Beasley commented upon Andy's \nsecond deployment to Iraq. Andy didn't have to return, but he did \nanyway. BG Beasley reflected upon why. This is what he said:\n\n       Andy didn't have to go back to war. He came back a Purple \n     Heart recipient. . . . He wanted to go back to serve our \n     Nation, with our soldiers.\n\n  Brigadier General Beasley also said that Andy ``was a wonderful \nsoldier and a brilliant patriot. He was someone who taught us a whole \nlot about wearing a uniform, about being a father, about being a \nhusband, and about being an American.''\n  Bret Howland was a good family friend and a father figure to Andy. He \nsaid the following about Andy's decision to return to Iraq:\n\n       He wanted to go with his people. He had this family, and he \n     had his family with 983rd--[his Army battalion]. Everybody \n     looked up to him, from the commander on down.\n\n  Bret also remembers how valuable Andy's friendship was. ``He was on \nsuch an even keel,'' he said. ``He was so calm in crisis, yet when he \nneeded to be, he was fiercely loyal.''\n  SFC James Gyori was Andy's platoon sergeant for 18 months. ``Andy was \nthe perfect soldier,'' he said. ``He did what you asked. He always had \na smile on his face. He was never in a bad mood--always there to help \neverybody. He got me through some rough days over there.''\n  Andy's friends all love and miss him dearly. Daily, messages are left \nhonoring him on Internet tribute Web sites. One friend from Anthony \nWayne High School, Jen Stone, shared her memories of Andy on one of the \nsites:\n\n       As a fellow classmate of Andy's from Anthony Wayne High, I \n     just want to say that he will truly be missed. I was friends \n     with Andy only a short time, but he really touched my life. \n     He was thoughtful, caring and just a great person all around. \n     I pray that his family will be able to remember Andy through \n     their memories and that his precious babies are taught what a \n     special daddy they had for the short amount of time he was on \n     this earth. I would like to thank him for serving and \n     protecting our country above and beyond what was expected of \n     him. I am so proud to have known him. I will be praying for \n     his family.\n\n  Another of Andy's friends, Tony Stephans, wrote that he wears a Hero \nBracelet to honor his friend. This is what he wrote:\n\n       I cherish the moments I get to spend with people explaining \n     the meaning behind my Hero Bracelet memorializing the life of \n     Andy. I proudly wear Andy's bracelet each and every day as a \n     constant reminder to myself and everyone around me of the \n     sacrifices\n\n[[Page S11457]]\n\n     made by Andy and his family, as well as those like him, who \n     stand in harms way so that each of us may enjoy [the] freedom \n     and liberties we have. I will always keep Tiphany, Myles, \n     Marlee, and all of Andy's family in my thoughts and prayers \n     and pray that time will help to heal the feeling of loss you \n     have all endured. Andy is still a hero and always will be.\n\n  Andy is also memorialized on the Wall of Heroes at Fort Snelling in \nMinnesota. The memorial features the etched faces of Army Reserve \nsoldiers who have fallen while serving their country in Iraq. Andy's \nwife attended the unveiling of the memorial. During the occasion, she \nsaid that ``my husband will always be honored. Every day I will honor \nhim.''\n  Andy's death has affected his entire community. Hundreds of mourners \nattended his memorial service to pay their respects. Family members \ncarried Gerber daisies, a special flower to Andy and his wife, to place \non his coffin. Many attendees also wore pink, because that had been \nAndy and Tiphany's color. Family friend Jackie Kidd-Lutzmann said the \nfollowing about Andy: ``He was the only guy who could wear pink and \nstill looked macho. He was a very, very special young man.''\n  At his funeral, numerous photographs from Andy's life were on \ndisplay, and a particularly touching one adorned the front cover of the \nprogram. In it, Andy bends carefully over his daughter, Marlee, and \ntogether they are walking off into the distance.\n  It is a beautiful picture.\n  During the service, Andy's wife reflected upon the love she and Andy \nhad shared. This is what she said:\n\n       I was going to write a letter, but I couldn't find the \n     words. But, Andy taught me that actions speak louder than \n     words. The biggest action he ever showed me was love. Because \n     God gave Andy to me, I know what it is to be cherished.\n\n  Andy Eckert was a courageous young man--a model husband, father, son, \nand brother. He will always be remembered.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep his family and friends in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n\n\n                 Private First Class Nicolas E. Messmer\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Army PFC Nicolas E. \nMessmer from Gahanna, OH, who was killed when an explosive device \ndetonated near his military vehicle in Iraq on May 8, 2005. He was just \n20 years old.\n  He is survived by his parents Richard and Shirley Messmer, his four \nbrothers Richard, Joseph, Dustin, and Zachary, his grandparents Ruth \nAnn Messmer, Martha and Clarence Lacey, and Donald Divers, and his high \nschool sweetheart, to whom he was engaged to be married, Mary Murphy.\n  Nick--as family and friends called him--grew up in a very close and \nloving family. He was the middle child of five boys, and 1 of 70 \ngrandchildren. Needless to say, he was extremely family-oriented--and \nsomeone with whom it was easy to get along. As his brother Joe said, \n``Nick was [just] an awesome person. He was the nicest, friendliest, \nhappiest kid you could ever know. He wouldn't hurt a fly.''\n  Nick graduated from Gahanna Lincoln High School in 2003 and \nimmediately joined the Army that summer. He didn't wait. He simply knew \nwhat he wanted to do--and that was to serve. As his brother, Joe, said, \n``He just went over there in [Iraq] to defend his country.''\n  And Nick's father said, ``Nick was the kind of soldier who makes this \ncountry great. He was just a great kid.''\n  Nancy Dawson, Nick's high school guidance counselor, said she wasn't \nsurprised when Nick joined the Army. She said the following in \nremembrance of Nick: ``I hope they remember his heart, his enthusiasm \nfor life, and just the neat kid that he was.''\n  People were just drawn to Nick. They loved his warm and friendly \npersonality. He was just an endearing, easy-going, nice guy. At Lincoln \nHigh, his death came as a great shock, and there was a moment of \nsilence in his memory.\n  Nick had many friends who will miss him dearly. Internet tribute web \npages are filled with messages from those whose lives he impacted. One \nof his friends, Kendra Hardrick, wrote the following:\n\n       Nick, I just wanted to tell you that I miss you and all the \n     crazy times we had together when we were younger and use to \n     sneak out. I miss the old group. I just wanted to say that \n     you're my hero and always will be. There is not a day that \n     goes by that I don't think of you. I wish you could be here, \n     and we all miss you.\n\n  While Nick had many, many friends, the one person dearest to him was \nhis fiancee Mary. She remembers Nick as someone who was ``wonderful, \nfunny, never angry and, always smiling.'' She said that he was very \nbrave. I am very proud of him. His family loved him. We all did.\n  Mary remembers the last time she talked with Nick and how excited he \nwas about serving his country. This, of course, is simply the kind of \nperson Nick was--always optimistic, always looking to the future.\n  ``We had so many plans,'' Mary recalls. She remembers how Nick \nsometimes wanted to buy a motorcycle, and sometimes wanted to buy a \ntruck. ``He wanted to be a firefighter,'' she said. ``He wanted to be a \ncop. He wanted to have his own lawn-care service. He wanted to be so \nmany things.'' Although we don't know what else in life he would have \ndone, this much is certain--Nick Messmer was a brave and dedicated \nMarine, who gave his all in service to his country.\n  Those who knew Nick will never forget him. Upon his death, hundreds \nof friends, neighbors, and family members gathered at a memorial \nceremony to pay their respects. From Gahanna Lincoln High School, \nalone, hundreds of students formed a line that wrapped all the way \naround the school, symbolizing a wall of support for Nick and his \nfamily.\n  On an Internet tribute Web site, Nick's old health teacher from \nGahanna Lincoln, Linda Shannon, wrote her sentiments about Nick. This \nis what she wrote:\n\n       To the Messmer Family--I want to express my deepest \n     sympathy to your family on the loss of your son. We hope that \n     the expression of honor and respect from the students at the \n     high school as they lined the school's perimeter will, in \n     some way, help you know that Nick's service to this country \n     is greatly appreciated.\n\n  Nick's favorite color was orange. In his memory, utility poles along \nthe streets were decorated with orange bows and his brothers placed \norange roses on his casket. During calling hours, his family members \nwore orange ties.\n  At his funeral, Nick's pastor, Reverend Paul A. Noble, held back \ntears as he remembered the young man who gave his life for a cause he \nbelieved in. ``In the midst of sadness,'' he said, ``we are also filled \nwith pride and thanksgiving.''\n  Nick will never be forgotten by the community in which he grew up. \nJust last month, students at St. Matthew School in Gahanna honored \nNick--along with another fallen Marine from Ohio, LCpl Ryan E. Miller. \nThe school installed a ``peace pole'' and held a memorial prayer \nservice. Both fallen Marines were St. Matthew church parishioners. The \npole has the word ``peace'' inscribed on it in English, Spanish, Latin, \nItalian, German, and French. According to Principal Frances Michalec, \nthere are 2,000 such poles throughout the world.\n  Brianna Ruth is an 8th grader at St. Matthew. Reflecting upon the \nmeaning of the peace pole, she said that ``it will be really nice for \nNick and Ryan. Every time you drive by, you can remember them and what \nthey did for our country.''\n  I would like to conclude my remarks with a message left for Nick by \nhis friend Nick Stephenson. He wrote the following to his friend:\n\n       There will never be enough that I could say, no matter how \n     hard I try to describe it, bud. It's like you're now a \n     missing link in my life. A part of me has truly left with \n     you, Nick. Although you have so honorably departed from us to \n     walk this cold world alone, I have gained so much from your \n     passing. I remind myself daily of your awesome character and \n     strive to look at life as you did--with total satisfaction of \n     living freely with a courageous attitude toward life. I \n     honestly believe that you not only live on in my heart, but \n     your countrymen's hearts, as well. I salute you Nicolas E. \n     Messmer, and look forward to that one fine day when I will \n     see you again. My prayers are with you, Nick.\n\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep the family of Army PFC Nicolas \nMessmer in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                        Corporal Daniel Freeman\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding Ohioan--\nArmy Cpl Daniel Freeman from Cincinnati. He was killed in a helicopter\n\n[[Page S11458]]\n\ncrash on April 6, 2005, in Ghazni, Afghanistan. He was 20 years old.\n  Aboard a CH-47 Chinook helicopter with 14 other soldiers and three \nAmerican contractors, Daniel was on a mission to deliver mail and \nsupplies to the southern part of Afghanistan. He was bringing crucial \naid to an area plagued by violence and insurgency. The day of the crash \nmarked the deadliest day for the United States in Afghanistan since the \nfall of the Taliban.\n  Daniel took his time getting to Ohio, but it quickly became his home. \nBorn in California, he then lived in Israel until he was 9 years old \nand his family moved to Cincinnati. Daniel grew up with a passion to \nserve in the military--and he certainly had the family pedigree. Both \nhis mother Rebecca and his step-father Samuel had served in the \nmilitary--she in the U.S. Air Force and he in the Israeli infantry. \nSamuel remembers that ``Daniel wanted to be in the Army since he was 11 \nor 12 years old. You know how kids talk about it. But that was his main \ndrive.''\n  Daniel was also committed to his faith. He was a member of the B'Nai \nTzedek congregation in Kenwood and attended Yavneh Day School. Daniel's \nfaith shaped his commitment to helping others. It made him who he was.\n  As a student at Sycamore High School, Daniel jumped head first into a \nnumber of activities. He was a member of the rock climbing club, \nexplorers club, and medics in training. He played soccer, enjoyed \npaintball, and had a part-time job busing tables at a local restaurant. \nFriends describe him as caring, sensitive, driven, and funny. As his \nhigh school counselor, Dr. Maria Sarasua said, ``He was just a \nremarkable, easygoing [person]. He loved the outdoors, and he saw \nhimself in a job being outdoors.'' Daniel's step-father added, ``He \nliked music and the PlayStation. He was a teenager like any other \nteenager.''\n  But for all his normal teenage pursuits, Daniel still stood out. As \nhis high school principal recalled:\n\n       I would characterize him as sort of an adventurous kind of \n     a kid, and he had a passion for helping people. Early on, \n     even as a junior, he had plans to involve himself in the \n     military. It takes a special 18-year-old to sign up in these \n     times.\n\n  Daniel's step-father further explained Daniels desire to serve. This \nis what he said:\n\n       The main thing with my son is that he's always had a strong \n     sense of fairness and what is right and good. He truly \n     believed in serving his country and thought everybody should \n     do it to give back in some way.\n\n  Daniel took advantage of an Army program that allowed him to enlist a \nyear before he finished high school. After graduating from Sycamore \nHigh in 2003, he immediately began basic training. He went through \nairborne school at Fort Benning, GA, and was assigned to the Red \nDevils--the 173rd Airborne Brigade's 1st Battalion, 508th Infantry \nRegiment, stationed at Camp Ederle, Italy.\n  As a member of the Red Devils, Daniel served four months in Iraq \nbefore beginning his service in Afghanistan. Daniel's passion and \nenthusiasm for his work translated into much success. Jack Kilbride, \ncommander of the battalion's headquarters company, recalls that ``no \nmatter how mundane, how menial, or how difficult the task, Corporal \nFreeman accomplished it with a smile.''\n  Daniel Freeman was selfless. He volunteered to replace one of the \nsoldiers who was supposed to be aboard that helicopter on the day that \nhe died. Daniel's comrade had been working without sleep and needed \nrelief. Daniel was there to give it. This is simply what he had always \ndone.\n  Friends and family remember Daniel and celebrate his life. Staff \nmembers at Sycamore High wore American flag ties and U.S. Army lanyards \nto remember Daniel. When he died, school officials at Sycamore lowered \nthe flag to halfstaff for Daniel, and the school observed a moment of \nsilence before classes began. Daniel's picture is still displayed in a \ncase that honors former students serving in the military.\n  Daniel's former English teacher, Liz Gonda, captured the sentiments \nof so many, saying simply, ``He knew what he wanted to do in life. He \nmade a difference in the world by his presence and will be greatly \nmissed.''\n  Funeral services were held on April 20, 2005, in Cincinnati. Shiva \nwas observed in his family's home. Daniel's mother planned on taking \nher son's ashes to Israel, where they would be returned to the earth \nfor all time. Additionally, a memorial fund has been set up in Daniel's \nname, as his family has said, ``we want to celebrate his life more than \nmourn it.''\n  Daniel's mother was kind enough to share with me one of her email \nexchanges with her son as he arrived in Afghanistan in February. In his \nemail, Daniel talked about some of the lessons he had learned in the \nArmy and how much he had grown. This is what he wrote:\n\n       I've learned that my mind can be my [ally] as well as my \n     enemy, and I'm constantly fighting it . . . you'll be amazed \n     at how your mind will set limits, but how far your body will \n     go.\n\n  Daniel goes on to explain to his mother his reasons for serving:\n\n       We don't fight for glory, we fight for those men, whom \n     we've bonded with, spent countless hours with, and suffered \n     with. I fight for them, for their wives, for their parents. \n     My biggest fear is not my death, it's the death of those \n     whose parents and wives I'll have to see suffer. That's why I \n     fight, that's what makes me a soldier, that's why I don't \n     question why I go to war. I accept it, clear my head, and get \n     my priorities straight. I want you to know that I love you \n     and will see you in a year from now.\n\n  Daniel Freeman was a very insightful, thoughtful young man. He \nunderstood the simple, but powerful truths of love and service to \nothers. He will never be forgotten.\n  My wife Fran and I keep all of Daniel's family and friends in our \nprayers.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair. And I thank the Chair for his \npatience.\n\n\n                        sergeant justin hoffman\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this evening to pay tribute to a fellow \nOhioan--Marine Sgt Justin Hoffman from Delaware. On August 3, 2005, \nSergeant Hoffman died when a roadside bomb detonated under his military \nvehicle in Iraq. He was serving with Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 25th \nMarine Regiment. Sergeant Hoffman leaves his father Robert, mother and \nstep-father Carole and Chuck and younger brothers Tyler and Travis. \nJustin was 27 year old at the time of his death.\n  Growing up, Justin's father remembers that his son came to love \nmotorcycles, cars, and anything competitive. He was smart, funny, and \ndedicated.\n  His friends and loved ones remember that he had one of the biggest \nhearts they had ever known. His smile and laughter will always be \nremembered. He was fun loving, but would also jump to be there for \nanyone who needed him.\n  Those who knew Justin remember that he loved to talk about pretty \nmuch anything--whether it was politics, cars, women, or his personal \ndedication to serving his country. And that is something that everyone \nremembers about Justin Hoffman--he was always proud to be serving our \nNation in the Marines Corps.\n  Justin graduated from Worthington Christian High School in 1995 and \nthen attended the Ohio State University. Before his junior year of \ncollege, he had joined the Marine Reserves. Justin's father had also \nserved in the Marines and remembers how proud he was of his son's \ndecision.\n  Justin's mother Carole recalls that he joined the Marines not only \nbecause he wanted to follow family tradition, but because he had \n``wanted some discipline in his life.'' She said that she saw a change \nin Justin after he completed his military training as a marine \nsharpshooter.\n  ``He was a good Marine,'' she said.\n  After graduating from Ohio State, Justin began working with \ninformation systems at Cardinal Health Center in Columbus. His dad \nrecalls that his son's intelligence qualified him for the job, but that \nhe was also big and strong and needed an outlet for his excess energy. \nKaren DePoy worked with Justin at Cardinal Health Center and remembers \nhow smart he was. She wrote the following message on an Internet \ntribute Web site:\n\n       It seems like just yesterday that I was getting this super \n     sharp intern to work with. What a terrific young kid, I \n     thought, as we\n\n[[Page S11459]]\n\n     discussed everything from personal investments to keeping the \n     faith during rough times.\n\n  Josh Busic also worked with Justin. This is what he wrote about his \nfriend:\n\n       He was one of the reasons I looked forward to coming into \n     work every day. There was never a boring day with him at \n     work. Whether it was one of his stories of someone he raced \n     in his car, some [silly] clip on the Internet he wanted all \n     of us to see, some argument on politics (there were a lot of \n     those) . . . him telling a story about one his brothers (whom \n     he talked about quite a bit), or just him ragging on us about \n     something that only he would think of--Justin was a good \n     friend and my only regret is that I didn't know him longer \n     than I did.\n\n  More than anything, Justin was a dedicated person. He was dedicated \nto his family, his job, and his marines. After 7 years of serving in \nthe Reserves, he re-enlisted in 2004. His mother remembers that \nJustin's reason for re-enlisting was because of the men he trained \nwith. ``He wanted to be their leader,'' she said.\n  Justin brother Tyler echoed these sentiments, when he said that \n``Justin told me that he couldn't let them--[his Marines]--go alone \nbecause he loved his men so much. He considered his whole squad to be \nbrothers.\n  Justin loved his fellow marines, and he loved his family. He was \nexceptionally close to his brothers, Tyler and Travis. Their parents \nwould never let them fight while growing up, and Tyler remembers how \nprotective Justin was of him. In Tyler words, Justin was a great \nbrother, and more than that, he was a great friend.\n  Justin's brother Travis remembers that the three of them were \n``inseparable.'' Justin was the best man in his wedding. It is a memory \nhe will always cherish. He remembers that his brother could always make \nhim laugh.\n  During his 27 years, Justin had also found the love of his life--his \ngirlfriend, Teri Price. The two planned to get married one day, and \nTeri remembers that Justin would tease her about proposing as soon as \nhe stepped off the plane on his way back from Iraq.\n  Teri recalls how much she loved Justin's smile and how ``he could \nalways make me laugh and [how] he was always joking. I loved him more \nthan anything.''\n  Teri--who knew Justin as ``Fen,'' short for his middle name of \nFenton--left him the following message on the Internet tribute website:\n\n       Fen, there aren't words deep enough to express how I feel \n     about you. I love you more than anything and was looking \n     forward to spending the rest of our lives together. You are \n     the most generous, selfless, kind, amazing, funny, thoughtful \n     person I know. I am so proud of you, and I am honored to have \n     been a part of your life. You made every day a happier day.\n\n  Family was so important to Justin. While in Iraq, he always kept in \ncontact with his mother. He would e-mail, write, and call on a regular \nbasis. His mom Carole remembers how Justin always wanted to hear about \nhow things were at home. ``Justin loved Eagle Pizza and wanted to hear \nabout the tree that needed uprooting in the yard,'' she said. ``Justin \njust spoke the truth.''\n  Justin's father remembers the last conversation he had with his son. \nIt was after Justin's close friend--fellow Ohio Marine Cpl Andre \nWilliams--had been killed in Iraq. Justin reassured his father that \nthere was nothing he needed, and then said good-bye with the following \nwords: I love you, Dad.\n  Mr. President, Marine Sgt Justin Hoffman lived a life that was \nhonorable and heroic. He was a devoted son, brother, and boyfriend. \nEveryday, he is dearly missed by his family, friends, and loved ones.\n  My wife Fran and I will continue to keep his family in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Bryan N. Taylor\n\n  Mr. President, this evening, I rise to pay tribute to a brave marine \nfrom Milford, OH. LCpl Bryan Taylor, who was killed in Iraq on April 6, \n2006, after he had been there for just 5 weeks. Bryan is survived by \nhis parents Rick and Sherri Taylor, and his younger brother Matthew. He \nwas just 20 years old at the time of his death.\n  A 2004 graduate of Milford High School, Bryan had a strong interest \nin computers and technology. He also attended Live Oaks Career \nDevelopment Center, where he studied computer-assisted drafting during \nhis last 2 years of high school. According to those close to him, Bryan \n``knew no strangers and had no enemies.'' One of his favorite things to \ndo was simply sit around and talk about good memories with his friends.\n  While reflecting on their memories of Bryan, his friends stressed his \nunceasing loyalty. Bryan's friend John Legleu said that ``people who \ndidn't even know Bryan that well are calling to tell me what he meant \nto them. He had a way of finding things in common, and he always found \nthe good in people.''\n  Friend Stacey Flick, added:\n\n       Bryan strived to make sure he was there for his friends no \n     matter what.\n\n  In fact, friends say it was the camaraderie of the Marine Corps that \nled Bryan to enlist.\n  As his friend James Wallace said:\n\n       Bryan was pretty much everything you want in a friend. . . \n     . He had such a big influence on the people he knew.\n\n  Those who knew Bryan also remember his compassion and his willingness \nto listen. As his friend John said:\n\n       I would always seek advice from [Bryan]. Even though I was \n     older, I would always get his opinion. He was mature beyond \n     his years.\n\n  Bruce Wallace, the father of Bryan's best friend James, shared the \nfollowing story about Bryan. This is what he said:\n\n       I'd come home from work and Bryan would be sitting in the \n     living room, watching TV alone, waiting for Jamie. I'd ask \n     him if he was hungry. He'd say, `No, I already ate,' and I'd \n     go into the kitchen and see an empty cereal bowl in the sink! \n     He was the only person who could get away with this because \n     he was truly my second son. He wasn't like any of us. He was \n     so exceptional.\n\n  After enlisting in 2005, Bryan quickly made friends among his fellow \nmarines. PVT Adam Michaels met Bryan during their training and shared \nthis story about him:\n\n       Bryan was a great guy, and we had a lot of good times. I \n     hung out with him before he left [for Iraq], and he always \n     had a great presence. I remember watching Bengals games with \n     him even though I am a huge Packers fan! He was as great as \n     they come.\n\n  Bryan lived life fully and left a lasting impression on his friends, \nfamily, and community. After his death, Miami Township named the \nfootball field at Miami Meadows Park, where Bryan used to played Pee \nWee football, in his honor.\n  Additionally, Clermont County held a ``Celebration of Life'' in \ntribute to Bryan. This celebration included a balloon launch of 60 red, \nwhite, and blue balloons, each filled with a note from Bryan's family \nand friends. Bryan's family also received an outpouring of support from \nmany other families of fallen servicemembers, which has meant so very \nmuch to them.\n  In talking about the loss of servicemembers, GEN George S. Patton--\nwho I know is a favorite of the Presiding Officer--once said that we \nshould not mourn those who die on the field of battle. ``Rather,'' he \nsaid, ``we should thank God that such men lived.''\n  Indeed, Mr. President, while we mourn, we do thank God that Bryan \nTaylor lived. He was a good son, brother, friend, and marine. Everyone \nwho knew him loved him.\n  In December 2005, Bryan visited his old high school dressed in his \nmarine uniform. He came to say goodbye to his former teachers before \nleaving to serve in Iraq. According to those at the high school, he was \nvery proud to be a marine and visited frequently to keep in touch with \nhis favorite teachers. Milford High School Assistant Principal Mark \nLutz shared the following story about his final visit with Bryan:\n\n       Bryan had a young person's bravado. . . . Bryan was an \n     excellent young man. He was always looking for a new \n     challenge. . . . I think the Marines gave him a sense of \n     direction.\n\n  Assistant Principal Lutz also remembers the pride with which Bryan \nserved. This is what he said:\n\n       Bryan was very proud of his decision to serve in the \n     Marines, which he credited with giving him direction and \n     helping him become an adult. He was looking forward to \n     returning to his unit to prepare for his tour of duty in \n     Iraq.\n\n  In describing his role in the military, Bryan, himself, wrote the \nfollowing paragraph shortly before he died:\n\n       I am a Marine. . . . I am proud of what I do and to serve \n     the country that I do. We are here for you and your families. \n     We are the ones who are willing to give our lives to make \n     your life easier and safer. . . . I have seen a lot of good \n     men lose their lives because of what our beliefs are. I honor \n     these men every day.\n\n\n[[Page S11460]]\n\n\n  Indeed, Mr. President, we all must honor these brave souls--and \nMarine LCpl Bryan Taylor is one of them. He will be remembered as a \nwonderful young man, a loyal friend, and a proud marine. My wife Fran \nand I continue to keep his family in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                    Staff Sergeant Jason A. Benford\n\n  Mr. President, this evening, I rise to honor the life of Army SSG \nJason A. Benford from Toledo, OH. On September 27, 2005, SSG Benford \ndied when insurgents attacked his patrol with small-arms fire in \nRamadi, Iraq. He was 30 years of age at the time.\n  Staff Sergeant Benford was a devoted family man--the husband of \nKimberly and the father of two young sons, Lane and Jacob. He is also \nsurvived by his parents George and Linda Benford, his sisters Kimberly \nand Lori, his brother John, his grandparents Robert and Deloris, and \nnumerous nieces and nephews.\n  Jason truly was an excellent serviceman--the epitome of what a \nprofessional soldier should be. He was also a man who cared deeply for \nfamily and friends. His personal integrity and his devotion to duty \nwere unmatched, and he consistently set high standards for himself.\n  Jason was born on June 8, 1975. A 1993 graduate of Bowsher High \nSchool, he attended the University of Toledo before enlisting in the \nArmy in 1994. He originally enlisted for 3 years, as a ``learning and \ngrowing'' experience. But it turned out that the Army was Jason's true \ncalling, and he re-enlisted once his initial service was complete. \nAccording to his step-mother, Jason was planning to make the Army his \ncareer.\n  After graduating from Basic and Advanced Individual Training, Jason \nserved in the Republic of Korea before being assigned to Fort Benning, \nGA, where he served as team leader and senior gunner. In Georgia, Jason \nfound more to keep him busy than simply being an excellent soldier. It \nwas at this time that he met and married Kimberly, the love of his \nlife, whose hometown was near Fort Benning.\n  ``My mother had told me not to date soldiers,'' Kim remembers. ``But \nI did--and I married him.'' Shortly after being married in January \n1998, Jason was transferred to Vilseck, Germany, where he and Kim \nremained for 3 years before returning to Georgia.\n  Jason loved his wife dearly, but he also loved his Ohio State \nUniversity football, and on January 3, 2003, which was both his wedding \nanniversary and the night of the Buckeyes' legendary NCAA championship \ngame against Miami, he had to make a choice. The decision, however, was \neasy. Lucky for him, Kim ate quickly, and the game went into overtime. \n``He took me out to dinner,'' Kim laughed, ``but he was looking at his \nwatch the whole time. He lived in Georgia, but he was always a \nBuckeye.''\n  In July 2005, Jason was able to spend Independence Day with his \nfamily while on a 2-week leave. It was a time in which many memories \nwere made. ``We spent time in Panama City, went to a Braves game in \nAtlanta, and had fun at Whitewater,'' Kim remembers. ``It was a great \ntime to be together--just the family.''\n  Kim remembers that her husband was a calm, even-tempered man who did \nnot easily lose his cool. ``He's always been a special, special person, \nso even-toned,'' she said. ``He'd handle all types of situations and \nnot even break a sweat. That was one of the things we appreciated so \nmuch, [and] I know the soldiers did too.''\n  Those who served with Jason also remember his calm demeanor and his \noptimistic nature. CPT Brian Mehan left his friend the following \nmessage on an Internet tribute website in memory of Jason:\n\n       Staff Sergeant Benford and I served together. His levity \n     and friendly demeanor made even the hard times more bearable. \n     The world will be a lesser place without him.\n\n  Those who knew Jason have rallied around his family in support. \nStacey Jarzeboski, from Toledo, left his parents and family the \nfollowing message on that Internet tribute website:\n\n       I am so sorry to hear of your loss. My sisters (Becky & \n     Kim) and I were childhood friends of John and Jason. I can \n     remember how full of life [they] were together. I'm sorry \n     that he was taken from you.\n\n  Nothing was more important to Jason than his family, and he talked to \nKim as often as possible while in Iraq. According the Kim, they sent \ninstant messages to each other twice a day and talked on the phone \nregularly while he was stationed there. After he was sent to Ramadi, \nhowever, Jason was only able to call once--the day before he died.\n  Jason was completing his second tour of duty in Iraq when he was \nkilled. His service to our Nation earned him more medals than I can \nname here, but they include the Bronze Star Medal, the Purple Heart, \nthe Army Commendation Medal, (1 Oak Leaf Cluster), and the Army \nAchievement Medal, (6 Oak Leaf Clusters).\n  Mr. President and Members of the Senate, Army SSG Jason Benford was \ndevoted both to the Army and to his country. But most importantly, \nJason was a loving husband, father, and son--someone for whom family \ncame first. He loved simply spending time with his family, and sharing \nhis love of sports with his two sons.\n  Mr. President, my wife Fran and I will continue to keep Jason and his \nfamily in our thoughts and in our prayers.\n\n\n                Lance Corporal Dustin Robert Fitzgerald\n\n  Mr. President, I rise tonight to pay tribute to Marine LCpl Dustin \nRobert Fitzgerald from Huber Heights, OH. On August 18, 2004, Lance \nCorporal Fitzgerald was killed in a vehicle accident in the Al Anbar \nProvince of Iraq. He was 22 years old. He is survived by his parents \nMichael and Melody Fitzgerald, and his brothers Brandon and Shannon.\n  Ever since he was a small boy, Dusty--as he was known by family and \nfriends--knew that he wanted to serve his country and help his fellow \ncitizens. While attending Wayne High School, he enrolled in the \nschool's Junior ROTC program.\n  Initially, Dusty wanted to be a pilot in the Air Force. However, he \ncame home one day and told his mother that he instead wanted to be a \nmarine. At such a young age, Dusty knew exactly what he wanted to do. \nHe was determined and took steps to pursue his dream.\n  Dusty simply loved ROTC. ``He gave his all,'' his mother recalled. \n``He enjoyed it so much and took it very seriously.'' Dusty \nparticipated in the Junior ROTC program for 3 years.\n  During this time, Dusty made many friends. The other young students \nin Junior ROTC respected him and enjoyed his company. They found him to \nbe sincere person--someone with a good sense of humor. One of Dusty's \nmany friends, Brenna Downs, wrote the following in a posting on an \nInternet tribute to Dusty:\n\n       When I heard about what happened to Dusty, I was \n     immediately taken back to junior high and early high school, \n     when he used to hang out with all of us. He definitely stood \n     out in our group with his sense of humor. He was genuine. \n     Years after I knew him, I still remember how he made us all \n     laugh. He was a good guy and will be remembered and missed by \n     his old friends.\n\n  Dusty and his friends enjoyed baseball, basketball and wrestling \nwhile they were in high school. Dusty's friends were drawn to him for \nthe same reasons his peers at Junior ROTC were drawn to him. His mother \nsaid that Dusty ``was very adventurous. [He had a] wonderful sense of \nhumor. [He was] easy-going. He never had an enemy.''\n  In addition to sports, Dusty was crazy for cars. ``When Dustin wasn't \nfighting in wars, he loved souping up cars,'' his mother recalled. In \nhigh school, Dustin fixed up a 1996 Dodge Stratus, outfitting it with \nracing tires and a spoiler. And just 4 months before he entered the \nMarines, he bought his dream car--a 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse. He spent \nhours fixing it up. While he was stationed in the Middle East, Dusty \nwould ask his mother to buy car accessories so he would have them when \nhe got home.\n  After graduating from Wayne High School in 2000, Dusty began taking \nsteps to fulfill his dream of becoming a marine. When he left for boot \ncamp, his family was extraordinarily proud of him. Melody said of her \nson, ``Dusty was proud, too. You [could] look into his eyes and see his \npride.''\n  After boot camp, Dusty's life moved quickly. He was assigned to \nBattalion Landing Team 1-2 with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit out \nof Camp Lejeune, NC. In January 2003, Dusty and his unit headed \noverseas on the U.S.S. Gunston Hall. His family missed him \ntremendously, but they knew he was doing the right thing--that he was \ndoing what he believed in.\n\n[[Page S11461]]\n\n  Dusty was dearly loved and respected by all. SSG B. Coomer said that \nbeing a marine was in Dustin's blood even before he enlisted. He left \nDustin's family the following message on the Internet tribute Web site:\n\n       I am terribly sorry to hear about Dusty. We graduated the \n     same year, and we were in Sea Cadets together. At the time, I \n     was the Cadet leader when I met him. He was a Marine long \n     before he entered Marine basic training.\n       I know that he was one of the most well disciplined cadets \n     in our unit. He always listened very well and took whatever \n     task we had to accomplish very seriously whether it was Kung \n     Fu training, drill, or running the obstacle course. He loved \n     the movie, `Full Metal Jacket' and often, we would joke \n     around with him telling him that he looked like the main \n     character. He would quietly laugh and [imitate that] \n     character.\n       I am thankful to have known him and to have served with \n     him. As I have said, he was a Marine long before he ever \n     entered basic training, and he will never be forgotten as a \n     friend, Marine, and fellow Sea Cadet.\n\n  During a memorial service in Dusty's honor, family, friends and \nneighbors all gathered to pay their respects. They released blue \nballoons in his honor.\n  Dusty be remembered by everyone he met. Christina Benn, who met Dusty \nin North Carolina, recalls her first meeting with him. This is what she \nsaid:\n\n       My daughters Alyssa and Lauren and I reside in Greenville, \n     North Carolina, where I had the pleasure of meeting . . . \n     Dustin. He was a very loving and compassionate Marine, who \n     came into our lives and brought us happiness. Our hearts go \n     out to the Fitzgerald family for life. We will keep you and \n     your precious loving son in our prayers, and may God help \n     guide you through these trying times.\n\n  The world is a better place since Marine LCpl Dustin Fitzgerald has \nbeen in it. He had a glowing smile, a fine sense of humor, a big heart, \nand a tremendous sense of dedication to his family, community, and \ncountry.\n  My wife Fran and I continue to keep Dustin's family in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n\n\n                         Sergeant James Worster\n\n  Mr. President, I rise tonight to remember a fallen servicemember--SGT \nJames Worster, from Broadview Heights, OH. Sergeant Worster was serving \nas a medic with the Army's 10th Command Support Hospital in Baghdad, \nwhen he died of cardiac arrest on September 18, 2006. He is survived by \nhis wife Brandy, his young son Trevor, his mother and stepfather Donna \nand Burleigh Thornton, his brothers Jack and Josh, and his sister Joy. \nHe was just 24 years old.\n  James Worster was a dedicated and compassionate young man who \nresponded to a pair of tragic events by finding a way to serve his \ncountry and help those in need. After his father Richard died from a \nmedical condition in 2000, James was inspired to become a doctor. He \nsimply decided that he wanted to help others.\n  One year later, James was studying at Cleveland State University when \nthe terrorists attacked the United States on September 11, 2001. The \nattacks had a profound impact on James and compelled him to enlist in \nthe Army. He had a strong desire to help prevent other such attacks \nfrom happening on our homeland. By becoming a medic in the Army, he was \nable to both honor his father and serve our Nation.\n  James was born in Fargo, ND, on March 30, 1982. He moved to Alaska \nwhen he was 7 and attended middle school and high school in the city of \nNorth Pole. Those who knew James describe him as a very focused \nstudent, who had a great work ethic. MAJ Jim Alonzo, who guided James \nthrough his high school Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps \nprogram, called him ``a shining star'' who was ``always there.''\n  These were the very words Major Alonzo used when recommending James \nfor an internship with the National Park Service after James's \nsophomore year of high school. Although the Park Service told Major \nAlonzo that they normally didn't hire interns as young as James, he was \nselected and spent the summers after his sophomore and junior years of \nhigh school working at Yellowstone National Park. This is the kind of \nimpressive young man he was.\n  While serving in the ROTC program in high school, James met Brandy \nKusinski. He fell in love. After graduating from North Pole High School \nin 2000, James joined Brandy, then his fiancee, at Cleveland State \nUniversity. The two were married on October 13, 2002, and they \ncelebrated the birth of their son Trevor 2 years later.\n  James felt a strong bond with children, both here at home and in \nIraq. According to his mother, James's son Trevor ``was the light of \nhis life.'' Donna said that her son ``hoped someday the country would \nbe safe for his son and all people's [children].''\n  This caring nature was evident in James's work at the 10th Combat \nSupport Hospital in Baghdad, where he treated children who had been \nshot. His mother Donna said, ``He was glad he was there for them, and \nhe was glad he was there for his soldiers.''\n  James's work with soldiers and civilians, especially children, served \nas practice for what he hoped would be a medical career when he \nreturned from Iraq. In Iraq, he performed a range of procedures that \nwould prepare him procedures ranging from setting bones to even \ndelivering babies.\n  Those who met James were always impressed by his compassion and \nconsideration. Cesar Gonzalez served in the 10th Combat Support \nHospital alongside James. According to Cesar, James was one of the \nkindest persons in the hospital. He said that James would always ask \nhim how he was doing and that he would always put the needs of others \nabove his own. As James's mother said, he just ``loved people, and he \n[in turn] was loved by a lot of people.''\n  James's family remembers him as someone who cared deeply about others \nand pursued his dreams with a smile on his face. In a written \nstatement, his family spoke of this compassion and desire to help those \naround him. This is what they wrote:\n\n       [James] had a very strong faith in God and a very strong \n     love of country. James lived life to the fullest, raising his \n     son and being a wonderful son, himself. Pursuing his dreams \n     took him to the Army, where he learned to save lives and \n     truly believed he was making a difference. His beautiful \n     smile and endearing personality brightened any day, and . . . \n     he was a beacon of light and will forever be remembered and \n     loved.\n\n  While on leave, James was active in the Mustang Club in Colorado, an \norganization devoted to the preservation and appreciation of Mustang \ncars. James not only appreciated classic cars, he loved to race them.\n  It was through racing that James met many friends, including Brandy \nfrom Colorado. According to Brandy, racing on the track simply isn't \nthe same without James. She wrote the following on an Internet tribute \nWeb site in James's memory:\n\n       He was one of the greatest people I've ever met. I'm sorry \n     for all those who didn't have a chance to meet him. He \n     brought so much to everyone he met. It was just amazing to \n     see someone with that much compassion and heart.\n\n  Also posted on that same Internet tribute website, is a message from \nVicki Gleisner, whom James knew as ``Aunt Vicki.'' This is what she \nwrote:\n\n       From the first day I met James, I knew he was a very \n     confident, gentle young man. Even though I think he was only \n     5 at the time, he wasn't a little boy. He was always \n     protecting his mom. I guess that when he was satisfied that \n     his mom was taken care of, he decided to take care of the \n     rest of us. James always had a very respectful way about him, \n     and he always made me feel important. Thank you for letting \n     me be a part of your life, James, and for leaving your smile \n     in my heart, so I can remember your gentleness.\n\n  James was a young man who truly understood the importance of service \nto others--his family, his friends, and our Nation. He was a devoted \nhusband, father, son, and brother. His life was one filled with, and he \nmade a positive impact on everyone whom he met. My wife Fran and I will \ncontinue to keep SGT James Worster's family and friends in our thoughts \nand prayers.\n\n\n                         Captain Tyler Swisher\n\n  Mr. President, I rise tonight to honor and to remember a fellow \nOhioan--Marine Captain Tyler B. Swisher from Cincinnati, OH. On October \n21, 2005, CPT Swisher was killed when his vehicle was struck by an \nimprovised explosive device while conducting combat operations against \nenemy forces in Iraq. He was 35 years-old.\n  Tyler was the type of person who simply never gave up. He always \nsought out new challenges. At the time of his death, he was serving his \nthird tour of duty in Iraq--and was looking forward to serving two \nmore. This is typical of his dedication and determination to succeed.\n\n[[Page S11462]]\n\n  In high school, Tyler proved himself academically, by spending hours \nstudying his books and lessons. His hard work paid off, when he made \nthe honor roll during his senior year--an accomplishment for which he \nwas very proud. After high school, Tyler went on to Butler University, \nwhere he graduated with a degree in biology in 1993.\n  And then, Tyler set his sights on the Marines. A longtime friend of \nthe Swisher family, Jack Buckholz, remembers that Tyler attacked the \nchallenges of boot camp with the same ferocity and determination that \nhe had displayed with everything he did. He spent 6 months training on \nhis own to make sure he was prepared. He ran several miles a day and \nworked construction to strengthen his muscles. ``He had a rope that he \nwould climb every day,'' Jack Buchholz remembers. ``After that, boot \ncamp was not so bad [at all].''\n  Tyler entered the Marines as an enlisted man and then worked his way \nup to Officer's Commission in 1997 and eventually became on to being a \ncompany commander for the 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, based in \nCamp Lejeune, NC. When he died in Iraq, 200 Marines were under his \ncommand.\n\n       Tyler died doing what all Marine officers aspire to do--\n     [and that is] lead Marines in combat,'' said Captain Gary \n     McCullar, one of Tyler's best friends. ``Tyler never \n     faltered. Tyler did it right.\n\n  Tyler sought out challenges that most people would shy away from--\nchallenges like training for mountain warfare in Korea, which involved \nsteep climbing, rocky slopes, and living outdoors in harsh elements. \n``It was miserable,'' Captain McCullar remembered. ``[And,] he loved \nit.''\n  Tyler always pushed himself beyond all expectations and always gave \nhis best--whether it was for himself, his school, or his country.\n  Tyler was a dedicated and hard-working Marine, but he was also a \nselfless person, who always placed the needs of family, friends, \nMarines, and Nation above his own. But, most important to him were his \nwife Stephanie and their three children: Ashleigh, Madison, and Jacob. \nStephanie's brother Peter Lynch remembers that Tyler was a devoted \nfather and a committed husband. For Stephanie, he was consistently a \nsource of strength. No matter how bad a day she was having, he was \nalways able to get a burst of laughter out of her.\n  And Tyler's daughter Ashleigh left him the following message on an \nInternet tribute Web site:\n\n       Tyler Swisher, my Dad, was an amazing man. He was more than \n     a Dad to me . . . he was my hero. He gave me the strength to \n     face many hardships in my life, and he was always there for \n     me. He was the best father anybody could ask for. He's my \n     inspiration everyday to live life. . . . I will never stop \n     missing him. I'm so proud of you Daddy, thanks so much for \n     being my hero, and protecting us all. With love, Ashleigh.\n\n  Todd Smith was one of Tyler's boyhood buddies. At Tyler's funeral, he \naddressed the following words to his friend:\n\n       I remember sitting in the [movie theater], watching `The \n     Empire Strikes Back' all day long. You were always there for \n     me more than I was there for you. I could count on you to \n     tell me right from wrong. I could count on you to stick up \n     for me, and you taught me to stick up for myself. I've always \n     looked up to you and can't begin to say how proud I am of \n     you. You made the ultimate sacrifice for your country, and \n     you are truly a hero. I am lucky and blessed you were part of \n     my life.\n\n  Tyler's fellow Marines in Iraq felt the same respect and admiration \nfor Tyler as his family and friends did back home. Doug Miorandi from \nPhoenix, AZ, expressed his respect for his friend and fellow serviceman \non an Internet tribute Web site. This is what he wrote:\n\n       I was fortunate enough to have served with Tyler and feel \n     honored to call him my friend. Tyler and I were roommates for \n     over two years, serving at both Marine Barracks Washington, \n     D.C., and the Presidential Retreat at Camp David. From being \n     a `spit and polished' Presidential Security Guard to a hard \n     charging Marine grunt, Tyler epitomized the word `Marine.' \n     I'll never forget our time together, and I feel fortunate to \n     have been a part of your life.\n\n  CPT Tyler Swisher was buried a hero at Arlington National Cemetery, \nand I am honored that I had the opportunity to attend the funeral \nservices in Ohio for this fine marine. The streets were lined with \nfamily, friends and fellow servicemen and women who had come to honor \nhim. Everyone I spoke to that sunny November day had the same thing to \nsay--Tyler Swisher had loved being a marine, and he loved what he was \ndoing.\n  I would like to conclude with the words of Tyler's dear friend, CPT \nGary McCullar, who was Tyler's military escort on his final journey \nhome. In a letter to the Cincinnati Post thanking the community and \ncitizens for the respect and honor they showed to Tyler and his family, \nhe wrote the following:\n\n       Captain Swisher epitomized the meaning of the Marines. He \n     was a leader, he was tough, he was the best that this country \n     has to offer, but most importantly he was a man who loved his \n     wife and children and enjoyed spending every minute he could \n     with them. Captain Swisher was also the best friend I ever \n     had. I am very proud of how the City honored my friend.\n\n  Indeed the world is a better place because of Tyler Swisher. My wife \nFran and I will continue to keep his family--his wife Stephanie and \ntheir three children Ashleigh, Madison, and Jacob, his parents David \nand Mary Beth Swisher, and his siblings John and Sara--in our thoughts \nand in our prayers.\n  I thank the Chair very much this evening. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11462-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11462-S11465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATORIAL SERVICE\n\n\n                               Bill Frist\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that today I \nhonor our distinguished majority leader, Senator Bill Frist. After \nserving with Bill for the last 12 years, I have come to know that he is \na fine leader, an accomplished physician and a wonderful person. He is \na man of compassion and conviction who has served our Country and this \nbody well.\n  It is only fitting that the majority leader of the U.S. Senate be a \nperson who has dedicated his life to serving others.\n  We all know of Bill's remarkable service to people around the world \nas a transplant surgeon for over 20 years. We have applauded him on \nseveral occasions as he has embarked on pilgrimages to help bring \nneeded medical expertise to impoverished countries. We have seen him \nfight to secure over $15 billion in Federal funding to fight the spread \nof HIV/AIDS in Africa. We have marveled at his dedication to serving \nthe people of Tennessee. And time and again, we have witnessed him here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate in the middle of the night conducting \nthe people's business and ensuring the legacy of the Senate continues \nin the most professional manner.\n  I hope everyone understands what a sacrifice it is to take on \nleadership duties here in Washington. The Federal Government never \nsleeps. When elected representatives come to Washington, they bring \nwith them the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of each one of their \nconstituents. Those who take this responsibility seriously spend every \nwaking moment addressing concerns and working for the people they \nrepresent. That is quite a responsibility to bear. When you add to that \nresponsibility the duties of being a leader and looking out for the \ninterests of those you lead, the duties are immense and the sleepless \nnights really start to mount. I, for one, am grateful for Bill's \nexemplary service and willingness to spend his life looking out for the \ninterests of others.\n  Over the last 4 years, as Bill has been majority leader, I have had \nseveral occasions to seek him out and ask for his advice and counsel. \nIn every instance, he has made himself available. There have been times \nwhen I have been working on issues of great importance to the citizens \nof Utah until 1, 2, or even 3 in the morning and, even though the items \nwe were working on did not impact Bill or his constituents, he and his \nstaff were gracious enough to stay up and work with me. For that I am \ngrateful.\n  As a highly trained physician, Bill has changed the way the Senate \napproaches health care policy. As a member of the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Senate Finance \nCommittee, two committees with jurisdiction over health care issues, \nBill has used his insight and training to shape and move\n\n[[Page S11463]]\n\nlegislation which greatly improves the health of Americans and the \nhealth care system in general. His skill as a physician has greatly \nimproved the knowledge of this body and has made the lives of countless \npeople better.\n  Tennessee's storied history of capable Senators is long and includes \nsuch names as Andrew Jackson, Andrew Johnson, Howard Baker, and, my \ngood friend, Fred Thompson. These men represented the best of what \nAmerica has to offer, and Bill Frist has done much to add to this great \nlegacy. As majority leader, Bill has shepherded through some very \nimportant legislation, including the Medicare prescription drug benefit \nlegislation, scores and scores of tax cut legislation for the American \npeople, legislation to reduce health care disparities among races, \nlegislation to make health care more affordable and accessible, \nlegislation to bolster America's defenses against bioterrorism, \nlegislation to reduce childhood obesity, legislation to prevent \nchildhood vaccine shortages, and legislation fighting drug abuse.\n  Bill's willingness to support Federal funding for stem cell research \nthis year made a huge difference in the national debate. I truly \nappreciated Bill's support earlier this year to pass legislation that \nwould make more embryonic stem cell lines available for Federal \nfunding. Stem cell research is one of the most important issues we face \ntoday. Stem cell research gives hope to millions of people who have \nnone. More than 100 million Americans suffer from heart disease, \ncancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, and so \nmany other life-threatening and life-debilitating diseases. Thanks to \nBill's support, on July 18 of this year, the Senate passed H.R. 810, \nthe Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act, by a vote of 63 to 37. H.R. 810 \nwould have allowed Federal funding for stem cell research using stem \ncell lines derived under strict ethical requirements from excess in \nvitro fertilization embryos, regardless of the date they were derived. \nI am grateful to Bill for taking such a bold and courageous stand on \nthis issue for those suffering from these dreaded diseases and who will \nbe helped by this research.\n  In closing, Bill is a consummate family man who cherishes family and \nthe values family represents. He has been married to his wife Karyn for \n22 years and, even as majority leader of the U.S. Senate, he has always \nmade time for his three sons: Harrison, Jonathan, and Bryan.\n  There is no doubt Bill will be successful in any endeavor he \nundertakes as he leaves this great body. He has proven himself time and \nagain and there is no question in my mind, he will be successful in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts and service of our good \nmajority leader, Bill Frist. He is a great man, a great patriot, and a \ngreat friend, and I wish him well in his future endeavors.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend our \ncolleague Mark Dayton, the Senator from Minnesota, for his \ndistinguished service in the Senate and for his commitment to helping \nour country live up to its highest ideals at home and abroad.\n  Mark's life has been about service to others. Whether as a teacher in \nthe bowery of New York, a counselor to troubled teens in Boston, an \naide to our beloved Fritz Mondale, or State economic development leader \nworking to bring quality jobs to his constituents, or a Senator, Mark \nDayton has consistently answered the call of public service throughout \nhis long and outstanding career.\n  He has been a champion of the right to quality and affordable health \ncare for all Americans, and I know how frustrated he has often been by \nour inability to make greater progress on this critical domestic issue. \nSadly, it will be harder to get there without him, but I am optimistic \nthat we will still be able to accomplish it, and I have no doubt that \nMark will continue with his commitment and compassion to help lead the \ncharge from outside the Senate.\n  As a Senator, he had an indispensable role in our effort to expand \nthe availability of prescription drugs. His heart went out to the \nsenior citizens in Minnesota whose only hope to afford the drugs they \ndesperately needed was to cross the border into Canada. Fortunately, in \nits effort to build a legal fence to keep them out, the drug industry \nmore than met its match in Senator Mark Dayton. Even my constituents in \nMassachusetts loved Mark, as they boarded buses from Boston to \nMinnesota to catch the lifesaving bus to Canada and get their medicine.\n  Mark also has had the courage to stand against the administration \nwhen it launched the tragic and misguided war in Iraq.\n  He never wavered in the Senate from what he believed was right, and \nwe will all miss the skill and eloquence, the decency, honor, and \ngenerosity he brought to our Senate debates.\n  We regret very much that he won't be here with us in the debates \nahead, and we wish him well. Perhaps he will be able to make that \nArctic trek to the North Pole that he had to put on hold when he came \nto the Senate 6 years ago. But I know that whatever new course he \nchooses, he will continue to be a strong and vital voice in improving \nthe lives of others.\n  As Robert Kennedy said, ``Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or \nacts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he \nsends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a \nmillion different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a \ncurrent that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and \nresistance.''\n  Throughout his brilliant career, Mark Dayton has sent forth many \nripples of hope, and I'm certain he'll send forth many more in the \nyears ahead. We'll miss you, Mark.\n\n\n                             Senator Dayton\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a retiring \ncolleague, Senator Dayton of Minnesota.\n  Mark Dayton has made a career of public service, in the very best \nsense of the term. After graduating from college, he taught public \nschool in New York City and served as a counselor to teenage runaways \nbefore returning to Minnesota. For 20 years, he served in a variety of \npositions in State government in Minnesota, from commissioner of \nEconomic Development to State auditor.\n  In the Senate, Mark Dayton has been an independent voice in the \ntradition of our former colleague, Paul Wellstone. He eschewed \npolitical expediency and instead relied on his conscience in making \nimportant decisions. For example, he agonized over his vote on the Iraq \nwar, before ultimately deciding to join the small minority of Senators \nwho voted against it.\n  I have worked most closely with Mark on agriculture and other issues \naffecting rural Americans. Trhoughout his Senate service, he has been a \nstrong and consistent voice on behalf of family farmers. He has helped \nlead the fight for much needed disaster relief. He has opposed \nmisguided cuts to commodity and conservation programs. And he has been \na leader in calling for a significant expansion of ethanol and other \nrenewable fuels that can benefit our rural economies and reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Senator Dayton has also been a strong voice on behalf of our troops \nand their families at home. He has called for better armor and \nequipment. He has insisted on better care for veterans. And he \nspearheaded efforts to ensure that soldiers on leave could get all the \nway home to visit their loved ones rather than simply being dropped off \nat remote cities and asked to pay last-minute air fares to get home.\n  Mark Dayton has insisted on integrity and honesty in every aspect of \nhis public life. He has been a true champion for Minnesota. Lucy and I \nwish him well as he goes on to other ventures.\n\n\n                             lincoln chafee\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Senator Lincoln Chafee. \nSenator Chafee has served the people of Rhode Island well. He has \ndistinguished himself in a number of important policy areas, including \nstrengthening environmental protections and strengthening our national \nsecurity.\n  I most appreciated his efforts to promote fiscal responsibility. \nSenator Chafee has been steadfastly committed to sound government \nbudget policies. While he supported easing tax burdens for families by \nending the marriage tax penalty and increasing the child tax credit, he \nhad the courage to oppose irresponsible, budget-busting measures that, \nwhile politically popular, have resulted in huge fiscal deficits and an \nunsustainable increase in the Federal debt.\n\n[[Page S11464]]\n\n  Senator Chafee has also been an unwavering supporter of reinstating \npay-as-you-go constraints on the Federal budget first implemented by \nPresident Bush's father in 1990. Under those rules, any tax cut or \nincrease in Government spending must be accompanied by an equal \nspending cut or revenue increase.\n  I also appreciated Senator Chafee's commitment to bipartisanship. He \nunderstands that reaching across the aisle and working together more \noften than not results in better decisions and better, longer lasting \npolicy solutions. His efforts were not always appreciated by those in \ncharge over the last couple of years. But those of us who worked \nclosely with him know his commitment is genuine and his word is good.\n  I was pleased to welcome Senator Chafee to the Senate in 1999 when he \nwas appointed to fill the seat of his late father. I had the pleasure \nof working often with John Chafee. We were both members of the Senate \nFinance Committee. I was not surprised to find that the son, like his \nfather, was tough but fair-minded and a man of strong principle.\n  Senator Chafee brought a unique set of skills to the Senate. A native \nRhode Islander, he earned a B.A. in classics from Brown University and \nwas captain of the wrestling team. Instead of following immediately in \nhis father's footsteps, however, he initially worked as a blacksmith at \nharness race tracks in the United States and Canada and later in \nmanufacturing management. These experiences gave him a great deal of \nrespect for working people and helped him build a strong sense of \nindependence and plain old common sense.\n  It is also clear that Senator Chafee never forgets his other \nimportant job. As a father of three school-aged children, he often \nreminds his colleagues to consider the impact of our decisions on the \nnext generation. Whether he is working to preserve fragile wetlands in \nhis beloved home State, helping strengthen our homeland security, or \npreventing massive debts from accruing, he talks often about our \nresponsibility to our children.\n  Senator Chafee has served the State of Rhode Island with integrity \nand compassion. He will be missed.\n\n\n                              conrad burns\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge my colleague from Montana, \nSenator Conrad Burns, who will be leaving this body after serving \nMontanans for the past 18 years.\n  Since our States border one another, Senator Burns and I have had the \nopportunity to work together on issues important to our region and the \nNation. Senator Burns has been a strong advocate for the interests of \nhis State.\n  In 2002, Senator Burns and I joined forces to create the Bipartisan \nTask Force on Tribal Colleges and Universities. One of the goals we set \nfor the task force was to secure adequate resources on the Federal \nlevel to support and grow these valuable institutions. Senator Burns, \nas chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, was a strong \nadvocate in helping the task force achieve this goal. Under his \nleadership, the tribal colleges received some of the largest increases \nin Federal funding since their inception. This support has opened the \ndoor of opportunity for thousands of American Indians.\n  During this past year, we have also worked together on agricultural \ndisaster assistance legislation. Because both of our States have a \nstrong agricultural sector in our economy, this issue is very important \nto our constituents. The support he has given to agricultural disaster \nlegislation in both the Senate Appropriations Committee and the full \nSenate has been important to our efforts, and I appreciate his strong \nsupport.\n  Senator Burns was also a valuable member of the ICBM coalition. \nDuring these past years, he and I have worked together to make sure our \nNation has a strong military deterrent to emerging world threats.\n  Since he arrived in Washington as a Senator only 2 years after I did, \nwe have watched the debates and policy discussions in this body \ntogether for almost two decades now. During that time we have seen \neconomic ups and downs, a major change in international power \nstructure, and the new challenges we face after the 9/11 terrorist \nattacks.\n  Again, Mr. President, I have appreciated the opportunity to work with \nSenator Burns and wish him well as he leaves the Senate.\n\n\n                              jim jeffords\n\n  Mr. President, today I would like to take a moment to recognize my \nfriend and colleague, Jim Jeffords, who after 32 years of distinguished \nservice in Congress is retiring to spend more time with his family.\n  Jim Jeffords' family roots in Vermont can be traced all the way back \nto 1794. After attending public schools in Rutland, Jim received his \nundergraduate degree from Yale University and his law degree from \nHarvard Law School. He served in the U.S. Navy and retired from the \nU.S. Naval Reserve.\n  I have worked closely with Jim Jeffords for years on the Centrist \nCoalition. He is a good friend and someone I could always trust. Jim \nhas always been independent-minded with a strong sense of integrity, a \nreal commitment to fiscal responsibility, an unparalleled dedication to \nthe environment, and a passion for improving education for our \nchildren. During his time in Congress, Jim Jeffords left his mark on \nsome of the most important legislation this institution has passed, \nincluding the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Clean \nAir Act, the Clean Water Act, and the 2005 highway bill.\n  In 2001, Jim Jeffords made a historic and difficult decision to \nswitch his party affiliation to an Independent. He was never afraid to \nmake tough decisions, and this one was no exception. It took courage to \nstand up against the rising tide, knowing that his decision would tip \nthe balance in the Senate and set us on a new course.\n  Jim Jeffords embodies what it means to be a good Senator--honesty, a \nstrong work ethic, courage, dedication, and being true to one's \nconvictions. He is also thoughtful, modest, and soft spoken. With these \ncharacter traits it is hard to believe that he has a black belt in tae \nkwon do.\n  Jim Jeffords has been a true fighter for Vermont. His compassion and \nconviction will be missed in the U.S. Senate. I wish Jim and his family \nmany happy years ahead.\n\n\n                              mike dewine\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and recognize the \naccomplishments of a colleague who will be leaving the Senate at the \nend of this term. Senator Mike DeWine has represented Ohio in the \nSenate for 12 years. During his tenure, he has been an important \nadvocate for the interests of the Buckeye State.\n  Senator DeWine will be remembered for his work on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee and particu1arly his success \nas chairman of the Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging. He \nwas a vital and constructive member of the conference committee on the \nPension Protection Act, and he illustrated what can be accomplished \nwhen you are willing to work across party lines on a common goal.\n  I have also admired Senator DeWine's commitment to our Nation's \nchildren and his efforts to stop teen drug and alcohol abuse, as well \nas crack down on tobacco companies' marketing of their products to \nchildren and teens. With unfailing courage, he took on those in his own \nparty and other special interests to protect our kids from harmful \ntobacco products.\n  In addition, I believe he has set a good example for all of us in the \nSenate in how to honor those from our States who have fallen in service \nto our Nation. With deep admiration, I have listened to Senator DeWine \ncome to the floor and speak about the lives and families of Ohio \nservice men and women who have died in Iraq and other fields of battle. \nIt is clear that he understands and deeply respects the sacrifices made \nby our troops and their families.\n  Mr. President, for these and many other reasons, I have been honored \nto serve with Mike DeWine. I would like to join my colleagues in \nwishing the Senator and his family the best in the future and in paying \ntribute to his contributions to the Senate and our Nation. I wish him \nwell.\n\n\n                              MIKE DeWINE\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to one of our \nesteemed colleagues, Mike DeWine of Ohio. It has been my special joy \nand privilege to work closely with Senator DeWine for the last decade. \nSince 1997,\n\n[[Page S11465]]\n\nwe have led the Antitrust Subcommittee, each taking our turns as \nchairman and ranking member. Thanks to Mike's honesty, candor, and \ncooperative nature, we have forged a productive bipartisan partnership \nas we have worked to promote competition in many vital sectors of our \nNation's economy.\n  This productive, bipartisan working relationship has been a hallmark \nof Senator DeWine's leadership of the Antitrust Subcommittee since he \nassumed the chairmanship of the committee in 1997. From the beginning, \nhe reached out to me and established our tradition of setting our \nagenda jointly, planning our hearings together, and even sponsoring \nlegislation and writing letters to the administration jointly. We \ntackled together such thorny issues as encouraging competition in \ntelecommunications, health care, the oil and gas, and airline \nindustries, investigating dozens of important mergers ranging from AOL/\nTime Warner to ATT/Bell South, and pursuing antitrust reform \nlegislation. While we have not always agreed on every issue that came \nbefore our subcommittee although I am happy to say we agreed more often \nthan not--Mike DeWine and I always agreed that we should put \npartisanship aside and accomplishing practical results for the American \npeople first.\n  On a personal note, our close working relationship has caused me to \ncome to know Mike DeWine very well. I have come learn that Mike is a \nsober-minded, hard working, and caring person. In my career, I have \nbeen privileged to know and work with a few distinguished Members of \nthis Chamber whom I can truly call statesmen, leaders, and friends. \nMike DeWine is one of them. He will be missed.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the great service \nof retiring Senators Paul Sarbanes, Mark Dayton, and James Jeffords.\n  Senator Sarbanes' service in the Senate stretches back three decades. \nFirst elected in 1977, he had previously served as a Congressman and \nbefore that as a delegate in the Maryland State House. I have been so \ngrateful to the Senator for his advice and his work in this Chamber.\n  Senator Sarbanes is the son of immigrants from Laconia, Greece, and \nhe has often spoken about the pride that he has for his Greek heritage, \nas well as the inspiration that he draws from it through his work in \nthe Senate. His parents instilled in him a reverence for the principles \nof democracy and a respect for the values of opportunity and fairness. \nHe has championed these values throughout his life in public service, \npassing important legislation to reform the accounting industry, the \n2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among many other legislative accomplishments.\n  I want to thank Senator Sarbanes and his dedicated staff for their \nextensive and laudable work on the surface transportation \nreauthorization bill and in particular for their tireless efforts to \nensure our Nation's transit systems are adequately funded. With so much \ncongestion on our roads it is critical that we continue to invest in \nour trains, buses, ferries, and other modes of transportation to reduce \ncongestion and reduce travel times. Senator Sarbanes did this work in \nhis role as ranking member of the Banking Committee, and millions of \npeople everyday--especially in New York--who ride trains and buses to \nand from work should be grateful that we had him on our side for so \nmany years.\n  I could stand here for a long time singing the praises and \naccomplishments of Senator Sarbanes after a long and distinguished \ncareer in the Senate. I will end by saying this: We will miss him and \nhe has left his mark on this great Chamber.\n  I will also express a fond farewell to Senator Dayton.\n  It has been an honor to serve on the Armed Services Committee with \nSenator Dayton.\n  He has done a wonderful job for the people of Minnesota. In his time \nin the Senate Senator Dayton worked hard to live up to the legend of \nSenator Wellstone, to honor the values that Senator Wellstone \nchampioned in this body.\n  One example: I was grateful to Senator Dayton for his support of the \nNontraditional Student Success Act, a piece of legislation to help more \npeople attend college while working and raising families--to open the \ndoors of opportunity wider for more and more Americans.\n  I am grateful to Mark Dayton for his work to honor his values, and I \nknow he leaves this body having made the people of Minnesota proud.\n  I will also say a few words about Senator Jeffords.\n  Senator Jeffords has ably represented Vermonters here in the Congress \nfor decades. In doing so, he has reflected the independent spirit of \nVermonters, and no more so than when he took the courageous step in \n2001 to become an Independent and caucus with the Democrats.\n  Since that time, I have had the great pleasure of working with \nSenator Jeffords on the Environment and Public Works Committee. His \ntenure at that committee was a fitting capstone to his career, as he \nhas long been focused on environmental protection.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career, Senator Jeffords has \nbeen a strong advocate of renewable energy. In many ways, he has been \nahead of his time. In 1990, he introduced a bill to promote ethanol and \nother alternative fuels, and nearly 10 years ago he introduced \nlegislation to create a 20-percent renewable portfolio standard. During \nhis tenure first as chairman, and then as ranking member of the EPW \ncommittee, he has been a strong and clear voice for a cleaner \nenvironment.\n  He has been an ally and a champion of reducing pollution from \npowerplants, fighting global warming, and making our buildings more \nenergy efficient. And he has worked hard to hold the administration to \ntask for numerous rollbacks of our landmark environmental laws. During \nhis tenure on the committee, Senator Jeffords has been ably assisted by \na staff led by Ken Connolly and Alison Taylor. I thank them and Senator \nJeffords' entire staff for their assistance to me and my staff.\n  Unfortunately, I could not attend the final EPW meeting this week, \nbut I understand that Senator Jeffords announced that he is returning \nhome to Vermont, and described home as ``the place you can go where \nthey have to take you in.''\n  I know that Vermont will welcome Senator Jeffords back with open \narms, and I know that he will always have a home away from home here in \nthe Senate.\n  Finally, I also wish the very best to my Republican colleagues who \nwill leave the Senate at the conclusion of this Congress. The Senate, \nat its best, is a body that promotes bipartisanship, deliberation, and \ncooperation, and the dedication to shared values. It has been a \nprivilege to work with my departing colleagues on the other side of the \naisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11465-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11465-S11466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING MARY ARNOLD\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, as we approach this Christmas season, our \njoy is tempered by sorrow over the loss in late November of one of our \nSenate family members. The sorrow is borne of shock and loss as we \nmourn the sudden departure from this earthly life of our dear friend, \nMary Miller Arnold. Yet, as we grieve, we must also give thanks for her \nlife and for the enrichment she brought to all of the lives she \ntouched.\n  It has been my honor and privilege to have served in the U.S. Senate \nfor nearly 50 years. During this time, I have come to greatly \nappreciate and revere the work of the staff of the U.S. Senate. These \nwonderful women and men play a sometimes invisible but always crucial \nrole in the work of the Senate. They are dedicated, professional public \nservants who work long and unpredictable hours. When the Senate is in \nsession, their families' lives suffer and their social lives are almost \nnonexistent.\n  These are noble people who contribute to the history of our country \nevery day, but, sadly, they will rarely be mentioned in the history \nbooks. Yet their lives are perfect examples of humble attention to duty \nand service. Such a life was Mary Arnold's.\n  I came to know Mary from her previous positions in the U.S. Senate \nand to appreciate her work as well as to like her personally. I was \npleased and proud to have the opportunity to appoint Mary Arnold to her \nposition as a Senate doorkeeper when I was the Senate majority leader, \nSeptember 1, 1987. She did not disappoint. One year later\n\n[[Page S11466]]\n\nshe was promoted to doorkeeper supervisor.\n  Mary Arnold carried out her responsibilities superbly and with \ndistinction, in just the same way she conducted her life. She worked \nprofessionally, energetically, and with dignity. She was a caring, \nthoughtful, and very special person. Everyone who worked with her loved \nher. Selflessness was the hallmark of Mary Arnold's personality. She \nwas kind, thoughtful, polite, with a kind of old-world graciousness not \nseen so often these days. Mary exuded grace in this often graceless \nage. A tall woman, Mary had a quiet sense of authority about her which \nserved her well on the Senate floor. Her elegant bearing commanded \nrespect, and she knew just how to compel without offending. I admired \nher.\n  To me, Mary was a dear friend. I shall never forget her kindness to \nmy dear wife Erma. Especially at Christmas, a season Mary really \nenjoyed, Mary's love for her friends and family lighted our lives and \nset her apart. She fairly glowed as she made her Christmas visitations \nwith thoughtful notes and gifts which she must have spent hours \npreparing. She was a red rose among the pale lilies, and her memory \nwill ever warm our hearts.\n  Her passing is a loss to the Senate, her community, and, of course, \nher family.\n  To her loving husband of 48 years, Edwin, and her children, Mary \nElizabeth and Edwin, our hearts and prayers are with you.\n  Take comfort in knowing that Mary is now in the embrace of an all-\nloving God. As the Scriptures assure us:\n\n       And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and \n     there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, \n     neither shall be any more pain: for the former things are \n     passed away. (KJV, Revelations 21:4)\n\n                  The Rose Still Grows Beyond the Wall\n\n     Near a shady wall a rose once grew,\n     Budded and blossomed in God's free light,\n     Watered and fed by the morning dew,\n     Shedding its sweetness day and night.\n\n     As it grew and blossomed fair and tall,\n     Slowly rising to loftier height,\n     It came to a crevice in the wall,\n     Through which there shone a beam of light.\n\n     Onward it crept with added strength,\n     With never a thought of fear or pride.\n     It followed the light through the crevice's length\n     And unfolded itself on the other side.\n\n     The light, the dew, the broadening view,\n     Were found the same as they were before;\n     And it lost itself in beauties new,\n     Spreading its fragrance more and more.\n\n     Shall claim of death cause us to grieve,\n     And make our courage faint or fall?\n     Nay! Let us faith and hope receive:\n     The rose still grows beyond the wall.\n\n     Scattering fragrance far and wide,\n     Just as it did in the days of yore,\n     Just as it did on the other side,\n     Just as it will forevermore.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Scent of the Roses\n\n     Let fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy;\n     that come, in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang around it still.''\n     --Thomas Moore\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11466-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11466]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RETIREMENT OF MR. ANTHONY J. ``TONY'' ZAGAMI\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise to announce the retirement of a \nlongtime public servant and former staff member of the U.S. Senate. \nAfter 40 years of Federal service, Anthony J. ``Tony'' Zagami will \nretire as the longest serving general counsel in the history of the \nU.S. Government Printing Office.\n  Tony arrived on Capitol Hill just as I was completing my first term \nin the Senate. Before Tony's arrival, I had the privilege of knowing \nand working with his late father, Dino, a member of the Senate's \nOfficial Reporters of Debates staff. Dino retired in the early 1970s, \nwhile Tony went on to serve the Congress, moving to the GPO in 1990.\n  Over the years, Tony Zagami became a valued and trusted staff member \nof the Congress in many different capacities. His strong skills and \ncommitment to public service were well recognized, not just on the Hill \nbut also throughout the legislative branch. As he departs the GPO for a \nwell-deserved retirement, I thank him for his service and wish him all \nthe best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11466-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11466-S11468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE OF CHANGE IN SENATE RULES COMMITTEE POLICY FOR THE USE OF SENATE \n                                 ROOMS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am taking this opportunity to announce \nthat in accordance with title V of the Rules of Procedure of the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration, the Committee intends to update \nthe Policy for Use of Senate Rooms.\n  Based on the Committee's review of the policy for use of Senate \nRooms, the following changes to these policies have been adopted \neffective today, December 7, 2006. The changes are designed to \nstreamline communications between the Rules Committee and Senate \noffices and to clarify the rules governing the use of Senate rooms.\n  Set forth below is the policy for the use of Senate rooms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Policy Regulations for Use of Senate Rooms\n\n   Appendix E. Policy for Use of Senate Rooms, The Russell Rotunda & \n   Courtyard, The Hart Atrium, The Great Hall of the Capitol Visitor \n                    Center, and The Capitol Rotunda\n\n       The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration has \n     jurisdiction over assignment and use of space in the Senate \n     Office Buildings, the Senate Wing of the Capitol, which \n     includes the Senate Wing of the Capitol Visitor Center, and \n     the Courtyard of the Russell Building. While rooms may be \n     occupied or administered by other offices or Committees, they \n     are subject to the Rules Committee policy for the use of \n     Senate rooms.\n       The following regulations have been established for use by \n     all offices in the assignment of their rooms.\n       Any requests, conditions or circumstances not covered by \n     these regulations must be submitted in writing to the Senate \n     Rules Committee for its consideration.\n     1. Booking a Senate Event Room\n       Rooms are available for Senate-related business only.\n       The Senator or Officer sponsoring the function is expected \n     to be in attendance.\n       Any requests or circumstances not covered by these room \n     regulations must be submitted to the Rules Committee in \n     writing for consideration.\n       Requests for the use of any space in the Senate Office \n     Buildings and the Senate Wing of the Capitol, including the \n     Senate wing of the Capitol Visitor Center, must be made by a \n     Senator or Officer of the Senate.\n       All requests for room reservations must be submitted to the \n     Senate Rules Committee on the official room request form \n     provided by Rules Committee. All required fields on the form \n     must be completed.\n       The requesting Senator's or Officer's signature must appear \n     on the room request form.\n       Specific and accurate information must be provided \n     including the date and time of the event, full name of any \n     organization or group involved (no acronyms), a complete \n     description of the function and its purpose, number of people \n     attending, type of set up required, and indication of \n     catering needs. A Senate staff contact name and telephone \n     number is required.\n       Each office may designate up to two staff members who will \n     be authorized to submit room requests on behalf of a Senator \n     or Officer of the Senate.\n       Rooms are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.\n       Room requests may be made up to a maximum of 3 months in \n     advance.\n       The Senate Rules Committee will not discuss room \n     availability prior to submission of an official room request \n     form.\n       Requests for rooms are subject to approval by the Rules \n     Committee and availability of space. The Senate Rules \n     Committee will provide a written or an e-mail response to all \n     submitted requests. A room reservation is not confirmed until \n     written or e-mail confirmation has been received.\n       Upon receipt of confirmation of a room reservation, \n     Senators and Officers must provide outside groups, who are \n     hosting a function in Senate space, with a copy of the \n     Official Guidelines for Use of Senate Space, a fact sheet \n     prepared by the Senate Rules Committee and available on the \n     Rules Committee web site.\n       Room reservation information is available to Senate staff \n     only. Offices requesting rooms are responsible for all \n     communications with outside groups. The Senate Rules \n     Committee will not discuss events, event arrangements, or \n     room availability with outside groups.\n       To accommodate the room requests of all Senators and \n     Committees, an outside group may not reserve a room more than \n     once in a calendar month.\n       Rooms may not be ``held'' on a tentative basis.\n       Cancellations should be reported immediately to the Senate \n     Rules Committee.\n\n[[Page S11467]]\n\n     2. Use of Space Assigned to a Senator, Committee Chairman, or \n         an Officer of the Senate\n       Requests for use of space assigned specifically to a \n     Senator, Committee Chairman, or Officer of the Senate should \n     be made directly to that individual. Room regulations apply \n     to all Senate rooms.\n     3. Use of Senate Event Rooms\n       The Senator sponsoring the function will be held \n     accountable for enforcement of all room regulations. Outside \n     groups disregarding the Policy for Use of Senate Rooms, as \n     set forth by the Committee on Rules and Administration, may \n     have their reservation cancelled, event terminated, or may be \n     prohibited from scheduling future events in Senate rooms.\n       All requests for a Senate event room for use by a \n     Committee, or under the auspices of a Committee, must be made \n     or approved by the Chairman of that Committee. (If the \n     Committee is a joint committee, the request must be made or \n     approved by the Senator who is Chairman or Vice-chairman of \n     that Joint Committee.) A use is considered to be ``by a \n     Committee'' or ``under the auspices of a Committee'' when the \n     announcement, agenda or notice for the use identifies Senate \n     participants as members of the Committee.\n       Standing Committees of the Senate, Special Committees of \n     the Senate, Select Committees of the Senate, and Joint \n     Congressional Committees may hold committee hearings and \n     conduct meetings in Senate rooms. Congressional hearings and \n     official legislative meetings take precedence over all other \n     functions.\n       Events may be booked Monday-Friday. Events may begin no \n     earlier than 7:30 am in the morning. Evening events must \n     conclude by 10:00 pm.\n       The precise time period scheduled for room use must be \n     strictly adhered to.\n       Weekend events are generally not permitted.\n       Specific event arrangements (set-up, catering) should be \n     discussed directly with those responsible for providing the \n     services in Senate space, as indicated on the Rules \n     Committee's Room Request Form. Set-up and catering entities \n     may not provide information about other scheduled events or \n     availability of other event rooms.\n       Since rooms are available only for Senate-related business, \n     there is no charge for such use. Therefore, no charge is \n     permitted in connection with the use of Senate space, nor may \n     any charge be assessed for admittance or refreshments in \n     Senate space.\n       Weddings, funerals, memorial services, tributes, award \n     ceremonies, or other events of a personal nature are not \n     allowed.\n       Events that may endanger the public or create an \n     unreasonable risk of liability for the United States Senate \n     are not permitted. Outside groups are not permitted to use \n     Senate space to conduct events intended to simulate \n     Congressional hearings or legislative meetings.\n       Demonstrations and disruptive behavior are not permitted.\n       Excessive noise or sound amplification is not permitted.\n       Music during business hours is not permitted (see Section \n     9).\n       Animals are generally not permitted at events in Senate \n     rooms, except in cases where an animal provides necessary \n     assistance to an individual with disabilities.\n       Education, training, and health screening conducted in \n     Senate space by outside entities for the Senate community \n     must be coordinated with and conducted through the Senate \n     Office of Education and Training or the Senate Employee \n     Assistance Program.\n       No money or items may be collected on Senate property for \n     any purpose, including charitable purposes.\n       Senate space may not be used for any fund-raising purpose.\n       Senate space may not be used for political activities, \n     including political campaign, political party, or political \n     action committee activities.\n       Booking and use of Senate space for any commercial, \n     promotional, or profit-making purpose is strictly prohibited.\n       No signs, placards, photographs, brochures or pamphlets \n     displaying a group or company name or logo are permitted.\n       Exhibits must be educational in nature and must relate to \n     Senate business.\n       Trade fairs are not permitted.\n       No products or services may be promoted or sold on the \n     premises. No promotional material may be distributed on the \n     premises.\n       No material may be attached anywhere in Senate rooms, \n     including walls, windows, window treatments, and doors.\n       Banners anywhere on Senate property are strictly \n     prohibited.\n       The Senate will not be held responsible for articles \n     brought into the Senate buildings or onto Senate grounds for \n     functions and exhibits. The Senate does not provide insurance \n     for such articles.\n     4. Cancellation of Events\n       Since Senate Committee hearings and official legislative \n     meetings take precedence over all other functions, it may be \n     necessary to cancel or move a function on short notice based \n     on the legislative schedule of the Senate.\n       Groups disregarding the Policy for Use of Senate Rooms, as \n     set forth by the Committee on Rules and Administration, may \n     have their reservation cancelled, event terminated, or may be \n     prohibited from scheduling future events in Senate rooms.\n     5. Food and Beverages\n       Food and beverages for events in Senate rooms may only be \n     provided by the Senate event food and beverage service \n     provider (s) designated by the Senate Rules Committee. \n     Information regarding the designated provider (s) will be \n     posted on the room request form and the Official Guidelines \n     for Use of Senate Space fact sheet prepared by the Senate \n     Rules Committee.\n       Catering arrangements for special events or functions must \n     be made directly with the designated food and beverage \n     service provider(s).\n       The Senate Rules Committee must grant a waiver for any \n     special event food that cannot be furnished by the Senate \n     food service vendor (such as home state products celebrating \n     the food of a state). Requests for waivers must be submitted \n     in writing to the Senate Rules Committee well in advance of \n     the event.\n       All food and beverages served at a function must be \n     consumed within the scheduled room. No food or beverages are \n     permitted in the corridors outside event rooms.\n     6. Financial Obligations\n       Outside groups are expected to make arrangements for \n     payment for any catering expenses in advance of the event \n     date and in accordance with contractual requirements.\n       The Senator or Officer sponsoring the function is \n     responsible for any loss of or damage to Senate property and \n     for any financial obligation incurred.\n     7. Room Set-Up\n       The Office of the Senate Superintendent will make \n     arrangements for the set-up of a room in the Senate Office \n     Buildings with the sponsoring Senator's staff or designated \n     constituent contact. Arrangements for room set up in the \n     Senate wing of the Capitol and the Capitol Visitor Center are \n     made through Capitol Facilities.\n       There is no charge for set-up of rooms by the Senate \n     Superintendent's Office or Capitol Facilities.\n       At the time the reservation is approved by the Rules \n     Committee, Senate offices should make arrangements, or should \n     notify their constituent contact that arrangements for the \n     set-up of the room must be made directly with the \n     Superintendent's Office or Capitol Facilities. Arrangements \n     should be made as soon as possible, but at least 2 business \n     days in advance of the event, in order to guarantee the \n     availability of adequate furniture, equipment, and supplies.\n       Room set-up arrangements may not be changed on the day of \n     an event.\n     8. Room Capacity\n       The Senate Rules Committee posts information on its web \n     site regarding the maximum capacity of event rooms, based \n     upon set-up style. The maximum room capacity by set-up style \n     permitted by the Fire Marshal shall not be exceeded. Failure \n     to adhere to the maximum room occupancy level may result in \n     termination of an event or function.\n     9. Music\n       No music is permitted in the Senate wing of the Capitol \n     when the Senate is in session.\n       No music is permitted in the Senate Office Building event \n     rooms or in the Capitol Visitor Center event rooms when the \n     Senate is in session until after 6:00 p.m.\n       When the Senate is in recess, music is permitted after 5:00 \n     p.m.\n       Music may be provided during the approved time periods by \n     string instruments or a piano. Amplified music is not \n     permitted.\n       Vocal performances and singing are not permitted at any \n     time in Senate space, except by special permission in the \n     Russell Senate Office Building Rotunda. See Russell Rotunda \n     section.\n     10. Press Conferences\n       Only Senators may conduct press conferences. Outside groups \n     may not hold press conferences in Senate event rooms.\n       Press conferences related to political campaign, political \n     party, or political action committee activities are not \n     permissible.\n     11. Photographing and Filming\n       Since Senate space may not be used for commercial, \n     promotional, or profit-making purposes whatsoever:\n       No promotional or commercial photographing or filming is \n     permitted.\n       Filming involving or related to commercial ventures, \n     including fictional movies and commercial documentaries, as \n     well as the use of Senate space to create or promote \n     commercial entertainment programming, is strictly prohibited \n     in Senate buildings and on the Capitol grounds.\n     12.

Admittance to Buildings\n       The Senate Wing of the Capitol, the Senate Wing of the \n     Capitol Visitor Center, and the Senate Office Buildings are \n     open during normal business hours. These areas are not open \n     on evenings, holidays, and weekends, unless the Senate is in \n     session.\n       The following information may be found on or accessed \n     through Webster:\n\n[[Page S11468]]\n\n       Information regarding normal business hours will be posted \n     on Webster.

Travel Authorization\n       A. Only those individuals having an official connection \n     with the function involved may obligate the funds of said \n     function.\n       B. Funds disbursed by the Secretary of Senate may be \n     obligated by:\n       1. Members of standing, select, special, joint, policy or \n     conference committees\n       2. Staff of such committees\n       3. Employees properly detailed to such committees from \n     other agencies\n       4. Employees of Members of such committees whose salaries \n     are disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate and employees \n     appointed under authority of section 111 of Public Law 95-94, \n     approved August 5, 1977, when designated as ``ex officio \n     employees'' by the Chairman of such committee. Approval of \n     the reimbursement voucher will be considered sufficient \n     designation.\n       5. Senators, including staff and nominating board members. \n     (Also individuals properly detailed to a Senator's office \n     under authority of Section 503(b)(3) of P.L. 96-465, approved \n     October 17, 1980.)\n       6.

All travel shall be either authorized or approved by the \n     chairman of the committee, Senator, or Officer of the Senate \n     to whom such authority has been properly delegated. The \n     administrative approval of the voucher will constitute the \n     approvals required. It is expected that ordinarily the \n     authority will be issued prior to the expenses being incurred \n     and will specify the travel to be performed as such possible \n     unless circumstances in a particular case prevent such \n     action.\n       E. Official Travel Authorizations: The General Services \n     Administration, on behalf of the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration, has contracted with several air carriers to \n     provide discount air fares for Members, Officers, and \n     employees of the Senate only when traveling on official \n     business. This status is identifiable to the contracting air \n     carriers by one of the following ways:\n       1. The use of a government issued travel charge card\n       2.

No Member, Officer, or employee \n     shall use any funds furnished to him [her] to defray ordinary \n     and necessary expenses of foreign travel for any purpose \n     other than the purpose or purposes for which such funds were \n     furnished.\n\n[[Page S11471]]\n\n       3.

For purposes of this provision, ``usual place of \n     residence'' in the home state shall encompass the area within \n     thirty-five (35) miles of the residence (by the most direct \n     route). If a Member has no ``usual place of residence'' in \n     his/her home state, he/she may designate a ``voting \n     residence,'' or any other ``legal residence,'' pursuant to \n     state law (including the area within thirty-five (35) miles \n     of such residence), as his/her duty station.\n       B.

In the case of an officer or employee, reimbursement for \n     official travel expenses other than interdepartmental \n     transportation shall be made only for trips which begin and \n     end in Washington, DC, or, in the case of an employee \n     assigned to an office of a Senator in the Senator's home \n     state, on trips which begin and end at the place where such \n     office is located.\n       2. Travel may begin and/or end at the Senate traveler's \n     residence when such deviation from the duty station locale is \n     more advantageous to the government.\n       3. For purposes of these regulations, the ``duty station'' \n     shall encompass the area within thirty-five (35) miles from \n     where the Senator's home state office or designated duty \n     station is located.\n       C. No employee of the Senate, relative or supervisor of the \n     employee may directly benefit monetarily from the expenditure \n     of appropriated funds which reimburse expenses associated \n     with official Senate travel. Therefore, reimbursements are \n     not permitted for mortgage payments, or rental fees \n     associated with any type of leasehold interest.\n       D. A duty station for employees, other than Washington, DC, \n     may be designated by Members, Committee Chairmen, and \n     Officers of the Senate upon written designation of such \n     station to the Senate Disbursing Office. Such designation \n     shall include a statement that the Member or Officer has read \n     and agrees to the pertinent travel regulations on permissible \n     reimbursements. The duty station may be the city of the \n     office location or the city of residence.\n       E. For purposes of these regulations, the metropolitan area \n     of Washington, DC, shall be defined as follows:\n       1. The District of Columbia\n       2. Maryland Counties of\n       (a) Charles\n       (b) Montgomery\n       (c) Prince Georges\n       (3. Virginia Counties of\n       (a) Arlington\n       (b) Fairfax\n       (c) Loudoun\n       (d) Prince William\n       4. Virginia Cities of\n       (a) Alexandria\n       (b) Fairfax\n       (c) Falls Church\n       (d) Manassas\n       (e) Manassas Park\n       5. Airport locations of\n       (a) Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall \n     Airport\n       (b) Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport\n       (c) Washington Dulles International Airport\n       F. When the legislative business of the Senate requires \n     that a Member be present, then the round trip actual \n     transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the city \n     within the United States where the Member is located to \n     Washington, D.C., may be reimbursed from official Senate \n     funds.\n       G. Any deviation from this policy will be considered on a \n     case by case basis upon the written request to, and approval \n     from, the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       V. Travel Expense Reimbursement Vouchers\n       A. All persons authorized to travel on official business \n     for the Senate should keep a memorandum of expenditures \n     properly chargeable to the Senate, noting each item at the \n     time the expense is incurred, together with the date, and the \n     information thus accumulated should be made available for the \n     proper preparation of travel vouchers which must be itemized \n     on an official expense summary report and stated in \n     accordance with these regulations. The official expense \n     summary report form is available at the Senate Disbursing \n     Office or through the Senate Intranet.\n       B. Computer generated vouchers should be submitted with a \n     signed original. Every travel voucher must show in the space \n     provided for such information on the voucher form the dates \n     of travel, the official travel itinerary, the value of the \n     transportation, per diem expenses, incidental expenses, and \n     conference/training fees incurred.\n       C. Travel vouchers must be supported by receipts for \n     expenses in excess of $50. In addition, the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration reserves the right to request \n     additional clarification and/or certification upon the audit \n     of any expense seeking reimbursement from the contingent fund \n     of the Senate regardless of the expense amount.\n       D. When presented independently, credit card receipts such \n     as VISA, MASTER CHARGE, or DINERS CLUB, etc. are not \n     acceptable documentation for lodging. If a hotel bill is lost \n     or misplaced, then the credit card receipt accompanied by a \n     certifying letter from the traveler to the Financial Clerk of \n     the Senate will be considered necessary documentation. Such \n     letter must itemize the total expenses in support of the \n     credit card receipt.\n\n\n                        transportation expenses\n\n       I. Common Carrier Transportation and Accommodations\n       A. Transportation includes all necessary official travel on \n     railroads, airlines, helicopters, buses, streetcars, \n     taxicabs, and other usual means of conveyance. Transportation \n     may include fares and such expenses incidental to \n     transportation such as but not limited to baggage transfer. \n     When a claim is made for common carrier transportation \n     obtained with cash, the travel voucher must show the amount \n     spent, including Federal transportation tax, and the mode of \n     transportation used.\n       (1. Train Accommodations\n       (a) Sleeping-car accommodations: The lowest first class \n     sleeping accommodations available shall be allowed when night \n     travel is involved. When practicable, through sleeping \n     accommodations should be obtained in all cases where more \n     economical to the Senate.\n       (b) Parlor-car and coach accommodations: One seat in a \n     sleeping or parlor car will be allowed. Where adequate coach \n     accommodations are available, coach accommodations should be \n     used to the maximum extent possible, on the basis of \n     advantage to the Senate, suitability and convenience to the \n     traveler, and nature of the business involved.\n       (2. Airplane Accommodations\n       (a) First-class and air-coach accommodations: It is the \n     policy of the Senate that persons who use commercial air \n     carriers for transportation on official business shall use \n     less than first-class accommodations instead of those \n     designated first-class with due regard to efficient conduct \n     of Senate business and the travelers' convenience, safety, \n     and comfort.\n       (b) Use of United States-flag air carriers: All official \n     air travel shall be performed on United States-flag air \n     carriers except where travel on other aircraft (1) is \n     essential to the official business concerned, or (2) is \n     necessary to avoid unreasonable delay, expense, or \n     inconvenience.\n       B. Change in Travel Plans: When a traveler finds he/she \n     will not use accommodations which have been reserved for him/\n     her, he/she must release them within the time limits \n     specified by the carriers. Likewise, where transportation \n     service furnished is inferior to that called for by a ticket \n     or where a journey is terminated short of the destination \n     specified, the traveler must report such facts to the proper \n     official. Failure of travelers to take such action may \n     subject them to liability for any resulting losses.\n       1. ``No show'' charges, if incurred by Members or staff \n     personnel in connection with official Senate travel, shall \n     not be considered payable or reimbursable from the contingent \n     fund of the Senate.\n       2. Senate travelers exercising proper prudence can make \n     timely cancellations when necessary in order to avoid ``no \n     show'' assessments.\n       C. Compensation Packages: In the event that a Senate \n     traveler is denied passage or gives up his/her reservation \n     due to overbooking on transportation for which he/she held a \n     reservation and this results in a payment of any rebate, this \n     payment shall not be considered as a personal receipt by the \n     traveler, but rather as a payment to the Senate, the agency \n     for which and at whose expense the travel is being performed.\n       1. Such payments shall be submitted to the appropriate \n     individual for the proper disposition when the traveler \n     submits his/her expense account.\n       2. Through fares, special fares, commutation fares, \n     excursion, and reduced-rate round trip fares should be used \n     for official travel when it can be determined prior to the \n     start of a trip that any such type of service is practical \n     and economical to the Senate.\n       3. Round-trip tickets should be secured only when, on the \n     basis of the journey as planned, it is known or can be \n     reasonably anticipated that such tickets will be utilized.\n       D. Ticket Preparation Fees: Each Chairman, Senator, or \n     Officer of the Senate may, at his/her discretion, authorize \n     in extenuating circumstances the reimbursement of penalty \n     fees associated with the cancellation of through fares, \n     special fares, commutation fares, excursion, reduced-rate \n     round trip fares and fees for travel arrangements, provided \n     that reimbursement of such fees offers the best value and \n     does not exceed $30.\n\n[[Page S11472]]\n\n       E. Frequent Flyer Miles: Travel promotional awards (e.g. \n     free travel, travel discounts, upgrade certificates, coupons, \n     frequent flyer miles, access to carrier club facilities, and \n     other similar travel promotional items) obtained by a Member, \n     officer or employee of the Senate while on official travel \n     may be utilized for personal use at the discretion of the \n     Member or officer pursuant to this section.\n       1. Travel Awards may be retained and used at the sole \n     discretion of the Member or officer only if the Travel Awards \n     are obtained under the same terms and conditions as those \n     offered to the general public and no favorable treatment is \n     extended on the basis of the Member, officer or employee's \n     position with the Federal Government.\n       2. Members, officers and employees may only retain Travel \n     Awards for personal use when such Travel Awards have been \n     obtained at no additional cost to the Federal Government. It \n     should be noted that any fees assessed in connection with the \n     use of Travel Awards shall be considered a personal expense \n     of the Member, officer or employee and under no circumstances \n     shall be paid for or reimbursed from official funds.\n       3. Although this section permits Members, officers and \n     employees of the Senate to use Travel Awards at the \n     discretion of the Member or officer, the Committee encourages \n     the use of such Travel Awards (whenever practicable) to \n     offset the cost of future official travel.\n       F. Indirect Travel: In case a person, for his/her own \n     convenience, travels by an indirect route or interrupts \n     travel by direct route, the extra expense will be borne by \n     the traveler. Reimbursement for expenses shall be allowed \n     only on such charges as would have been incurred by the \n     official direct route. Personal travel should be noted on the \n     traveler's expense summary report when it interrupts official \n     travel.\n       G. Public Transportation During Official Travel: \n     Transportation by bus, streetcar, subway, or taxicab, when \n     used in connection with official travel, will be allowed as \n     an official transportation expense.\n       H. Dual Purpose Travel: Dual purpose travel occurs when a \n     Senator, staffer, or other official traveler conducts both \n     Senatorial office business and Committee office business \n     during the same trip. The initial point at which official \n     business is conducted will determine the fund which will be \n     charged for travel expenses from and to Washington, DC. \n     Examples include:\n       1. If committee business is conducted at the first stop in \n     the trip, travel expenses from Washington, DC, to said point \n     and return will be chargeable to the committee's funds. \n     Additional travel expenses from said point to other points in \n     the United States, incurred by reason of conducting \n     senatorial business, will be charged to the Senators' \n     Official Personnel and Office Expense Account.\n       2. If senatorial business is conducted at the first stop in \n     the trip, travel expenses from Washington, DC, to said point \n     and return will be chargeable to the Senators' Official \n     Personnel and Office Expense Account. Committee funds will be \n     charged with any additional travel expenses incurred for the \n     purpose of performing committee business.\n       I. Interrupted Travel: If a traveler interrupts official \n     travel for personal business, the traveler may be reimbursed \n     for transportation expenses incurred which are less than or \n     equal to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed \n     had he/she not interrupted travel for personal business. \n     Likewise, if a traveler departs from or returns to a city \n     other than the traveler's duty station or residence for \n     personal business, then the traveler may be reimbursed for \n     transportation expenses incurred which are less than or equal \n     to the amount the traveler would have been reimbursed had the \n     witness departed from and returned to his/her duty station or \n     residence.\n       II. Baggage\n       A. The term ``baggage'' as used in these regulations means \n     Senate property and personal property of the traveler \n     necessary for the purposes of the official travel.\n       B. Baggage in excess of the weight or of size greater than \n     carried free by transportation companies will be classed as \n     excess baggage. Where air-coach or air-tourist accommodations \n     are used, transportation of baggage up to the weight carried \n     free on first-class service is authorized without charge to \n     the traveler; otherwise excess baggage charges will be an \n     allowable expense.\n       C. Necessary charges for the transfer of baggage will be \n     allowed. Charges for the storage of baggage will be allowed \n     when such storage was solely on account of official business. \n     Charges for porters and checking baggage at transportation \n     terminals will be allowed.\n       III. Use of Conveyances: When authorized by the employing \n     Senator, Chairman, or Officer of the Senate, certain \n     conveyances may be used when traveling on official Senate \n     business. Specific types of conveyances are privately owned, \n     special, and private airplane.\n       A. Privately Owned\n       1. Chairmen of committees, Senators, Officers of the \n     Senate, and employees, regardless of subsistence status and \n     hours of travel, shall, whenever such mode of transportation \n     is authorized or approved as more advantageous to the Senate, \n     be paid the appropriate mileage allowance in lieu of actual \n     expenses of transportation. This amount should not exceed the \n     maximum amount authorized by statute for use of privately \n     owned motorcycles, automobiles, or airplanes, when engaged in \n     official business within or outside their designated duty \n     stations. It is the responsibility of the office to fix such \n     rates, within the maximum, as will most nearly compensate the \n     traveler for necessary expenses.\n       2. In addition to the mileage allowance there may be \n     allowed reimbursement for the actual cost of automobile \n     parking fees (except parking fees associated with commuting); \n     ferry fees; bridge, road, and tunnel costs; and airplane \n     landing and tie-down fees.\n       3. When transportation is authorized or approved for \n     motorcycles or automobiles, mileage between points traveled \n     shall be certified by the traveler. Such mileage should be in \n     accordance with the Standard Highway Mileage Guide. Any \n     substantial deviations shall be explained on the \n     reimbursement voucher.\n       4. In lieu of the use of taxicab, payment on a mileage \n     basis at a rate not to exceed the maximum amount authorized \n     by statute will be allowed for the round-trip mileage of a \n     privately owned vehicle used in connection with an employee \n     going from either his/her place of abode or place of business \n     to a terminal or from a terminal to either his/her place of \n     abode or place of business: Provided, that the amount of \n     reimbursement for round-trip mileage shall not in either \n     instance exceed the taxicab fare for a one-way trip between \n     such applicable points, notwithstanding the obligations of \n     reasonable schedules.\n       5. Parking Fees: Parking fees for privately owned vehicles \n     may be incurred in the duty station when the traveler is \n     engaged in interdepartmental transportation or when the \n     traveler is leaving their duty station and entering into a \n     travel status. The fee for parking a vehicle at a common \n     carrier terminal, or other parking area, while the traveler \n     is away from his/her official station, will be allowed only \n     to the extent that the fee, plus the allowable mileage \n     reimbursement, to and from the terminal or other parking \n     area, does not exceed the estimated cost for use of a taxicab \n     to and from the terminal.\n       6. Mileage for use of privately owned airplanes shall be \n     certified from airway charts issued by the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration, Department of Commerce, and \n     will be reported on the reimbursement voucher and used in \n     computing payment. If a detour was necessary due to adverse \n     weather, mechanical difficulty, or other unusual conditions, \n     the additional air mileage may be included in the mileage \n     reported on the reimbursement voucher and, if included, it \n     must be explained.\n       7. Mileage shall be payable to only one of two or more \n     employees traveling together on the same trip and in the same \n     vehicle, but no deduction shall be made from the mileage \n     otherwise payable to the employee entitled thereto by reason \n     of the fact that other passengers (whether or not Senate \n     employees) may travel with him/her and contribute in \n     defraying the operating expenses. The names of Senate Members \n     or employees accompanying the traveler must be stated on the \n     travel voucher.\n       8. When damages to a privately owned vehicle occur due to \n     the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, \n     Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the \n     scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act. Information on who to contact will \n     go here.\n       B. Special\n       1. General:\n       (a) The hire of boat, automobile, aircraft, or other \n     conveyance will be allowed if authorized or approved as \n     advantageous to the Senate whenever the Member or employee is \n     engaged on official business outside his/her designated duty \n     station.\n       (b) Where two or more persons travel together by means of \n     such special conveyance, that fact, together with the names \n     of those accompanying him/her, must be stated by each \n     traveler on his/her travel voucher and the aggregate cost \n     reimbursable will be subject to the limitation stated above.\n       (c) If the hire of a special conveyance includes payment by \n     the traveler of the incidental expenses of gasoline or oil, \n     rent of garage, hangar, or boathouse, subsistence of \n     operator, ferriage, tolls, operator waiting time, charges for \n     returning conveyances to the original point of hire, etc., \n     the same should be first paid, if practicable, by the person \n     furnishing the accommodation, or his/her operator, and \n     itemized in the bill.\n       2. Rental Cars:\n       (a) In no case may automobiles be hired for use in the \n     metropolitan area of Washington, DC, by anyone whose duty \n     station is Washington, DC.\n       (b) Reimbursements for rental of special conveyances will \n     be limited to the cost applicable to a conveyance of a size \n     necessary for a single traveler regardless of the number of \n     authorized travelers transported by said vehicle, unless the \n     use of a larger class vehicle on a shared cost basis is \n     specifically approved in advance by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration, or the form Request for a Waiver of the \n     Travel Regulations' is submitted with the voucher, and found \n     in order upon audit by the Rules Committee.\n       (c) For administrative purposes, reimbursement may be \n     payable to only one of two or more Senate travelers traveling \n     together on the same trip and in the same vehicle.\n       (d) Government Rate: In connection with the hire of an \n     automobile for the use in conducting Senate business outside \n     of Washington, DC, it should be noted that the Military \n     Traffic Management Command (MTMC),\n\n[[Page S11473]]\n\n     a division of the Department of Defense, arranges all rental \n     car agreements for the government.\n       (1) These negotiated car rental rates are for federal \n     employees traveling on official business and include \n     unlimited mileage, plus full comprehensive and collision \n     coverage (CDW) on rented vehicles at no cost to the traveler.\n       (2) For guidance on rate structure and the companies \n     participating in these rate agreements, call the approved \n     Senate vendor (currently the Combined Airline Ticket Office \n     (CATO)).\n       (3) Individuals traveling on behalf of the United States \n     Senate should use these companies to the maximum extent \n     possible since these agreements provide full coverage with no \n     extra fee. The Senate will not pay for separate insurance \n     charges; therefore, any individuals who choose to use non-\n     participatory car rental agencies may be personally \n     responsible for any damages or liability accrued while on \n     official Senate business.\n       (e) Insurance: In connection with the rental of vehicles \n     from commercial sources, the Senate will not pay or reimburse \n     for the cost of the loss/damage waiver (LDW), collision \n     damage waiver (CDW) or collision damage insurance available \n     in commercial rental contracts for an extra fee.\n       (1) The waiver or insurance referred to is the type offered \n     a renter to release him/her from liability for damage to the \n     rented vehicle in amounts up to the amount deductible on the \n     insurance included as part of the rental contract without \n     additional charge.\n       (2) The cost of personal accident insurance is a personal \n     expense and is not reimbursable.\n       (3) Accidents While On Official Travel: Collision damage to \n     a rented vehicle, for which the traveler is liable while on \n     official business, will be considered an official travel \n     expense of the Senate up to the deductible amount contained \n     in the rental contract. Such claims shall be considered by \n     the Sergeant at Arms of the Senate on a case by case basis \n     and, when authorized, settled from the contingent fund of the \n     Senate under the line item--Reserve for Contingencies. This \n     is consistent with the long- standing policy of the \n     government to self-insure its own risks of loss or damage to \n     government property and the liability of government employees \n     for actions within the scope of their official duties.\n       (4) However, when damages to a rented vehicle occurs due to \n     the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any Member, \n     Officer, or employee of the Senate while acting within the \n     scope of his/her employment, relief may be sought under the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act.\n       3. Charter Aircraft:\n       (a) Reimbursements for charter aircraft will be limited to \n     the charges for a twin-engine, six seat plane, or comparable \n     aircraft. Charter of aircraft may be allowed notwithstanding \n     the availability of commercial facilities, if such commercial \n     facilities are not such that reasonable schedules may be \n     kept. When charter aircraft if used, an explanation and \n     detail of the size of the aircraft, i.e., seating capacity \n     and number of engines, shall be provided on the face of the \n     voucher.\n       (b) In the event charter facilities are not available at \n     the point of departure, reimbursement for charter from \n     nearest point of such availability to the destination and \n     return may be allowed.\n       (c) When a charter aircraft larger than a twin-engine, six \n     seat plane is used, the form 'Request for a Waiver of the \n     Travel Regulations' is submitted with the voucher.\n       C. Private Airplane: Interpretative Ruling of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics, No. 412, issued August 11, 1986\n       In some circumstances, a Member who uses a private airplane \n     is required to reimburse the provider of the aircraft to \n     avoid either a prohibited gift under the Senate Gift Rule or \n     a prohibited in-kind contribution to an unofficial office \n     account. Senate Rule 38 (Prohibition of Unofficial Office \n     Accounts), generally prohibits private sources from providing \n     funds or services to defray a Member's officially related \n     expenses. Thus, if a friend offers to loan a Member an \n     aircraft to attend town meetings across the Member's home \n     state, the Member must reimburse for the use of the aircraft \n     to comply with Rule 38. Senate Rule 35 (Gifts) prohibits \n     Members from accepting from an individual or organization \n     with a direct interest in legislation, gifts aggregating over \n     $100 in a calendar year (The rule also prohibits gifts \n     aggregating $300 per calendar year from anyone who is not a \n     relative). Thus, if a lobbyist offers a Member the use of his \n     airplane to fly the Member on a vacation trip, and if the \n     value of the use of the airplane is over $100, the member \n     must provide reimbursement to comply with Rule 35.\n       In most circumstances, where reimbursement is not required, \n     the Member will still need to determine the value of the use \n     of the aircraft because, if the value is $250 or more, the \n     use of the aircraft must be disclosed on the Member's annual \n     financial disclosure forms.\n       In determining the value of an item for both reimbursement \n     and disclosure purposes, the Committee has consistently \n     stated that the applicable standard is the value of the item \n     to the recipient. In the use of private aircraft, the \n     Committee concluded that the value to a Member would be the \n     cost he would have to incur to purchase the same level of \n     service in the open market. The Committee felt that the level \n     of service generally provided in using private aircraft is \n     most nearly equivalent to first-class service provided by \n     commercial carriers where such commercial service is \n     available. Where no regularly scheduled commercial service is \n     available, to obtain the same service provided by the use of \n     a private aircraft, a Member would be required to charter \n     an airplane.\n       RULING: The Committee has agreed on the following method \n     for calculating the value of the use of an aircraft for both \n     reimbursement and disclosure:\n       1. If the cities between which the Member is flying have \n     regularly scheduled air service, regardless of whether such \n     service is direct, then the value of the use of the aircraft \n     is the cost of a first-class ticket from the point of \n     departure to the destination.\n       2. If the cities have regularly scheduled air service, but \n     only standard (coach) rate, then the value of the use of the \n     aircraft is the coach rate.\n       3. If either the city from which the Member flies or his \n     destination does not have regularly scheduled air service, \n     then the value of the use of the aircraft is the cost of \n     chartering the same or a similar aircraft for that flight.\n       The Committee notes that its ruling is generally consistent \n     with Federal Election Commission regulations pertaining to \n     the use of private aircraft by candidates for Federal office.\n       The Committee further notes that the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration has adopted travel regulations pertaining to \n     the level of reimbursement to be provided from official funds \n     to Members who seek such reimbursement for air transportation \n     costs they have paid. Our ruling addresses only the \n     reimbursement which Members must make to the individual or \n     organization whose aircraft he uses, not the level of \n     reimbursement Members may receive from official funds.\n       NOTE: The Gifts Rule limit discussed in this ruling has \n     changed. But the method of calculating the value of the use \n     of an aircraft remains the same.\n       IV. Interdepartmental Transportation\n       A. The reimbursement for interdepartmental transportation \n     is authorized as a travel expense pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 58(e) \n     but only for the incidental transportation expenses incurred \n     within the duty station in the course of conducting official \n     Senate business. Such reimbursement would include the \n     following expenses:\n       1. Mileage when using a privately owned vehicle\n       2. Bus, subway, taxi-cab, parking, and auto rental. \n     (However, reimbursement is prohibited for auto rental \n     expenses within the Washington D.C., metropolitan area duty \n     station.)\n       B. Pursuant to S. Res. 294, agreed to April 29, 1980, \n     section 2.(1), reimbursements and payments shall not be made \n     for commuting expenses, including parking fees incurred in \n     commuting.\n\n\n                          subsistence expenses\n\n       I. Per Diem Expenses\n       A. Allowance\n       1. Per diem expenses include all charges for meals, \n     lodging, personal use of room during daytime, baths, all fees \n     and tips to waiters, porters, baggagemen, bell boys, hotel \n     servants, dining room stewards and others on vessels, \n     laundry, cleaning and pressing of clothing, and fans in \n     rooms. The term ``lodging'' does not include accommodations \n     on airplanes or trains, and these expenses are not \n     subsistence expenses.\n       (a) Laundry: Laundry expenses must be incurred during the \n     mid-way point of a trip. Reimbursable laundry expenses are \n     for the refreshing of clothing during a trip, but not the \n     maintenance of the clothing.\n       (b) Meals: Reimbursable expenses incurred for meals while \n     on official travel include meals and tips for the traveler \n     only and may not include alcohol.\n       2. Per diem expenses will not be allowed an employee at \n     his/her permanent duty station and will be allowed only when \n     associated with round trip travel outside his/her permanent \n     duty station.\n       (a) Training: Meals in the duty station are only \n     reimbursable when they are incurred during a training \n     session. If the cost of the meal is included in the training \n     session, then a meal certification form should be included \n     with the voucher. The Committee on Rules and Administration \n     will consider these on a case by case basis. Meal \n     certification forms are available at the Disbursing Office or \n     on the Senate intranet.\n       (1) Training is defined as a planned, prepared, and \n     coordinated program, course, curriculum, subject, system, or \n     routine of instruction or education, in scientific, \n     professional or technical fields which are or will be \n     directly related to the performance by the employee of \n     official duties for the Senate, in order to increase the \n     knowledge, proficiency, ability, skill and qualifications of \n     the employee in the performance of official duties.\n       (2) Meetings in the duty station where meals are served, \n     such as but not limited to Chamber of Commerce monthly \n     meetings do not constitute training. Therefore, the meals \n     associated with these meetings are not an authorized \n     reimbursable expense.\n       3. In any case where the employee's tour of travel requires \n     more than two months' stay at a temporary duty station, \n     consideration should be given to either a change in official \n     station or a reduction in the per diem allowance.\n       4. Where for a traveler's personal convenience/business \n     there is an interruption of travel or deviation from the \n     direct route, the per diem expenses allowed will not exceed \n     that which would have been incurred on uninterrupted travel \n     by a usually traveled route and the time of departure from \n     and return to official business shall be stated on the \n     voucher.\n       5. Per diem expenses will be allowed through the time the \n     traveler departs on personal business and will be recommenced \n     at\n\n[[Page S11474]]\n\n     the time he/she returns to official business. Such dates and \n     times shall be stated on the voucher.\n       B. Rates\n       1. The per diem allowances provided in these regulations \n     represent the maximum allowance, not the minimum. It is the \n     responsibility of each office to see that travelers are \n     reimbursed only such per diem expenses as are justified by \n     the circumstances affecting the travel. Maximum rates for \n     subsistence expenses are established by the General Services \n     Administration and are published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. \n     Maximum per diem rates for Alaska, Hawaii, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and possessions of the United States are \n     established by the Department of Defense and are also \n     published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. In addition, per diem \n     rates for foreign countries are established by the Department \n     of State and are published in the document titled, ``Maximum \n     Travel Per Diem for Foreign Areas.''\n       (a) Per diem expenses reimbursable to a Member or employee \n     of the Senate in connection with official travel within the \n     continental United States shall be made on the basis of \n     actual expenses incurred, but not to exceed the maximum rate \n     prescribed by the Committee on Rules and Administration for \n     each day spent in a travel status. Any portion of a day while \n     in a travel status shall be considered a full day for \n     purposes of per diem entitlement.\n       (b) When travel begins or ends at a point in the \n     continental United States, the maximum per diem rate \n     allowable for the portion of travel between such place and \n     the place of entry or exit in the continental United States \n     shall be the maximum rate prescribed by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration for travel within the continental \n     United States. However, the quarter day in which travel \n     begins, in coming from, or ends, in going to, a point outside \n     the continental United States may be paid at the rate \n     applicable to said point, if higher.\n       (c) In traveling between localities outside the continental \n     United States, the per diem rate allowed at the locality from \n     which travel is performed shall continue through the quarter \n     day in which the traveler arrives at his/her destination: \n     Provided, that if such rate is not commensurate with the \n     expenses incurred, the per diem rate of the destination \n     locality may be allowed for the quarter day of arrival.\n       (d) Ship travel time shall be allowed at not to exceed the \n     maximum per diem rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration for travel within the continental United \n     States.\n       C. Computations\n       1. The date of departure from, and arrival at, the official \n     station or other point where official travel begins and ends, \n     must be shown on the travel voucher. Other points visited \n     should be shown on the voucher but date of arrival and \n     departure at these points need not be shown.\n       2. For computing per diem allowances official travel begins \n     at the time the traveler leaves his/her home, office, or \n     other point of departure and ends when the traveler returns \n     to his/her home, office, or other point at the conclusion of \n     his/her trip.\n       (a) The maximum allowable per diem for an official trip is \n     computed by multiplying the number of days on official \n     travel, beginning with the departure date, by the maximum \n     daily rate as prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration. If the maximum daily rate for a traveler's \n     destination is higher than the prescribed daily rate, then \n     the form ``Request for a Waiver of the Travel Regulations'' \n     must be submitted with the voucher showing the maximum daily \n     rate for that location and found in order upon audit by the \n     Rules Committee.\n       (b) Total per diem for an official trip includes lodging \n     expenses (excluding taxes), meals (including taxes and tips), \n     and other per diem expenses as defined by these regulations.\n\n\n                          incidental expenses\n\n       I. Periodicals: Periodicals purchased while in a travel \n     status should be limited to newspapers and news magazines \n     necessary to stay informed on issues directly related to \n     Senate business.\n       II. Traveler's Checks/Money Orders: The service fee for \n     preparation of traveler's checks or money orders for use \n     during official travel is allowable.\n       III. Communications\n       A. Communication services such as telephone, telegraph, and \n     faxes, may be used on official business when such expeditious \n     means of communications is essential. Government-owned \n     facilities should be used, if practical. If not available, \n     the cheapest practical class of commercial service should be \n     used.\n       B. Additionally, one personal telephone call will be \n     reimbursed for each day that a Senator or staff member is in \n     a travel status. The calls may not exceed an average of five \n     minutes a day, and cannot be reimbursed at a rate higher than \n     $5.00 without itemized documentation.\n       IV. Stationery: Stationery items such as pens, paper, \n     batteries, etc. which are necessary to conduct official \n     Senate business while in a travel status are authorized.\n       V. Conference Center/Meeting Room Reservations: The fee for \n     the reservation of a meeting room, conference room, or \n     business center while on official travel is allowable.\n       VI. Other: This category would be used (with full \n     explanation on the Expense Summary Report for Travel) to \n     disclose any expense which would occur incidentally while on \n     official travel, and for which there is no other expense \n     category, i.e., interpreting services, hotel taxes, baggage \n     cart rental, etc.\n\n\n                      Conference and Training Fees\n\n       I. Training of Senators' Office Staff: The Senators' \n     Official Personnel and Office Expense Account is available to \n     defray the fees associated with the attendance by the Senator \n     or the Senator's employees at conferences, seminars, \n     briefings, or classes which are or will be directly related \n     to the performance of official duties.\n       A. When such fees (actual or reduced) are less than or \n     equal to $500, have a time duration of not more than five (5) \n     days, and have been asked to be waived or reduced for \n     Government participation, reimbursement shall be made as an \n     official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration \n     for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, \n     reimbursement shall be made as a non-travel expense.\n       B. Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n       C. The costs of meals that are considered an integral, \n     mandatory and non-separable element of the conference, \n     seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the \n     attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal \n     certification form, which must accompany the reimbursement \n     voucher, is available in the Disbursing Office or through the \n     Senate Intranet.\n       II. Training of Committee Employees: Section 202 (j) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 provides for the \n     expenditure of funds available to standing committees of the \n     Senate for the training of professional staff personnel under \n     certain conditions. It is the responsibility of each \n     committee to set aside funds within its annual funding \n     resolution to cover the expenses of such training.\n       A. Prior approval for attendance by professional staff at \n     seminars, briefings, conferences, etc., as well as committee \n     funds earmarked for training, will not be required when all \n     of the following conditions are met:\n       1. The sponsoring organization has been asked to waive or \n     reduce the fee for Government participation.\n       2. The fee involved (actual or reduced) is not in excess of \n     $500.\n       3. The duration of the meeting does not exceed five (5) \n     days.\n       B. When such fees are less than or equal to $500, have a \n     time duration of not more than five (5) days, and have been \n     requested to be waived or reduced for Government \n     participation, reimbursement shall be made as a non-training, \n     official travel expense. However, if the fee or time duration \n     for meetings is in excess of the aforementioned, \n     reimbursement shall be made as an official training expense. \n     Reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n       C. If the fee or time duration for meetings is in excess of \n     the aforementioned, advance approval by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration must be sought. Training requests \n     should be received sufficiently in advance of the training to \n     permit appropriate consideration by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration.\n       D. The costs of meals that are considered an integral, \n     mandatory, and non-separable element of the conference, \n     seminar, briefing, or class will be allowed as part of the \n     attendance fee when certified by the registrant. The meal \n     certification forms which must accompany the reimbursement \n     voucher are available in the Disbursing Office or through the \n     Senate Intranet.\n       III. Training of Administrative Offices Staff: The \n     administrative approval of the voucher is the only approval \n     required by the Committee on Rules and Administration. \n     Training expenses of staff shall be limited to those fees \n     associated with the attendance by staff at conferences, \n     seminars, briefings, or classes which are or will be directly \n     related to the performance of official duties. However, \n     reimbursement shall not be allowed for tuition or fees \n     associated with classes attended to earn credits towards an \n     advanced degree or certification.\n\n\n                             Special Events\n\n       I. Retreats: Reimbursement of official travel expenses for \n     office staff retreats is allowable from the contingent fund \n     provided they follow the restrictions and authorizations in \n     these regulations. Reimbursement of expenses for meeting \n     rooms and equipment used during the retreat also is \n     allowable. The vouchers for retreat expenses should be noted \n     as retreat vouchers.\n       A. Discussion of Interpretative Ruling of the Select \n     Committee on Ethics, No. 444, issued February 14, 2002\n       An office retreat may be paid for with either or both \n     official funds (with Rules Committee approval) or principal \n     campaign committee funds. Private parties may not pay \n     expenses incurred in connection with an office retreat. \n     Campaign workers may attend, at campaign expense, office \n     retreats if their purpose in attending is to engage in \n     official activities, such as providing feedback from \n     constituents on legislative or representational matters.\n       B. When processing direct pay vouchers payable either to \n     each individual traveler or to the vendor providing the \n     retreat accommodations, prior approval by the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration is not required. Retreat expenses, \n     including but not limited to per diem, may be charged to the \n     office's official centrally billed government travel charge \n     card and paid on direct vouchers to\n\n[[Page S11475]]\n\n     the charge card vendor. Any deviation from this policy will \n     be considered on a case by case basis upon the written \n     request to, and approval from, the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration.\n       C. Spreadsheet of Expenses\n       1. The Member office, Committee, or Administrative office, \n     must attach to the retreat voucher(s) a spreadsheet detailing \n     each day of the retreat broken out by breakfast, lunch, \n     dinner, and lodging for each traveler attending the retreat.\n       2. For each traveler, the spreadsheet should list his/her \n     duty station, additional per diem expenses incurred outside \n     of the retreat, and any other retreat attendee the traveler \n     shared a room with during the retreat. Any non-staff members \n     attending the retreat also should be detailed on the \n     spreadsheet. The ``Waiver of the Travel Regulations'' form \n     does not need to be attached to retreat voucher(s) for the \n     sharing of rooms.\n       3. The per diem expenses for staff members attending a \n     retreat within their duty station are not reimbursable but \n     should be detailed on the spreadsheet. All expenses for non-\n     staff members attending the retreat are not reimbursable, \n     but their attendance at the retreat must be taken into \n     account when computing a per traveler cost on the \n     spreadsheet.\n       4. An example of this spreadsheet can be found on the \n     Senate Intranet. THIS IS NOT CURRENTLY TRUE, BUT HOPEFULLY \n     WILL BE BY PUBLICATION OF THESE REGULATIONS.\n       II. Funerals: 2 USC 68-2 restricts reimbursement from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate to those expenses that are \n     intimately and directly connected with the routine \n     legislative process of the Senate. Pursuant to S. Res. 458, \n     agreed to October 4, 1984 and S. Res. 263, agreed to July 30, \n     1998, reimbursement for travel expenses incurred for \n     attendance at funerals of individuals other than current or \n     retired Senators by a Member, officer, or employee of the \n     Senate is not authorized.\n\n\n                         Senators' Office Staff\n\n       I. Legislative Authority (2 U.S.C. 58(e), as amended)\n       (e) Subject to and in accordance with regulations \n     promulgated by the Committee on Rules and Administration of \n     the Senate, a Senator and the employees in his office shall \n     be reimbursed under this section for travel expenses incurred \n     by the Senator or employee while traveling on official \n     business within the United States. The term `travel expenses' \n     includes actual transportation expenses, essential travel-\n     related expenses, and, where applicable, per diem expenses \n     (but not in excess of actual expenses). A Senator or an \n     employee of the Senator shall not be reimbursed for any \n     travel expenses (other than actual transportation expenses) \n     for any travel occurring during the sixty days immediately \n     before the date of any primary or general election (whether \n     regular, special, or runoff) in which the Senator is a \n     candidate for public office (within the meaning of section \n     301(b) of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971), unless \n     his candidacy in such election is uncontested. For purposes \n     of this subsection and subsection 2(a)(6) of this section, an \n     employee in the Office of the President Pro Tempore, Deputy \n     President Pro Tempore, Majority Leader, Minority Leader, \n     Majority Whip, Minority Whip, Secretary of the Conference of \n     the Majority, or Secretary of the Conference of the Minority \n     shall be considered to be an employee in the office of the \n     Senator holding such office.\n       II. Regulations Governing Senators' Official Personnel and \n     Office Expense Accounts Adopted by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration Pursuant to Senate Resolution 170 agreed to \n     September 19, 1979, as amended.\n       Section 1. For the purposes of these regulations, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (a) Documentation means invoices, bills, statements, \n     receipts, or other evidence of expenses incurred, approved by \n     the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       (b) Official expenses means ordinary and necessary business \n     expenses in support of the Senators' official and \n     representational duties.\n       Section 2. No reimbursement will be made from the \n     contingent fund of the Senate for any official expenses \n     incurred under a Senator's Official Personnel and Office \n     Expense Account, in excess of $50, unless the voucher \n     submitted for such expenses is accompanied by documentation, \n     and the voucher is personally signed by the Senator.\n       Section 3. Official expenses of $50 or less must either be \n     documented or must be itemized in sufficient detail so as to \n     leave no doubt of the identity of, and the amount spent for, \n     each item. Items of a similar nature may be grouped together \n     in one total on a voucher, but must be itemized individually \n     on a supporting itemization sheet.\n       Section 4. Travel expenses shall be subject to the same \n     documentation requirements as other official expenses, with \n     the following exceptions:\n       (a) Hotel bills or other evidence of lodging costs will be \n     considered necessary in support of per diem.\n       (b) Documentation will not be required for reimbursement of \n     official travel in a privately owned vehicle.\n       Section 5. No documentation will be required for \n     reimbursement of the following classes of expenses, as these \n     are billed and paid directly through the Sergeant at Arms and \n     Doorkeeper:\n       (a) official telegrams and long distance calls and related \n     services;\n       (b) stationery and other office supplies procured through \n     the Senate Stationery Room for use for official business.\n       Section 6. The Committee on Rules and Administration may \n     require documentation for expenses incurred of $50 or less, \n     or authorize payment of expenses incurred in excess of $50 \n     without documentation, in special circumstances.\n       Section 7. Vouchers for the reimbursement of official \n     travel expenses to a Senator, employee, detailee pursuant to \n     section 503(b)(3) of PL 96-465, or individual serving on a \n     nominee recommendation panel pursuant to 2 USC 58(h) shall be \n     accompanied by an ``Expense Summary ReportuTravel'' signed by \n     such person. Vouchers for the reimbursement to any such \n     individual for official expenses other than travel expenses \n     shall be accompanied by an ``Expense Summary Report--Non-\n     Travel'' signed by such person.\n\n\n               Committee and Administrative Office Staff\n\n       (Includes all committees of the Senate, the Office of the \n     Secretary of the Senate, and the Office of the Sergeant at \n     Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate)\n       I. Legislative Authority (2 U.S.C. 68b)\n       No part of the appropriations made under the heading \n     'Contingent Expenses of the Senate' may be expended for per \n     diem and subsistence expenses (as defined in section 5701 of \n     Title 5) at rates in excess of the rates prescribed by the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration; except that (1) \n     higher rates may be established by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration for travel beyond the limits of the \n     continental United States, and (2) in accordance with \n     regulations prescribed by the Committee on Rules and \n     Administration of the Senate, reimbursement for such \n     expenses may be made on an actual expense basis of not to \n     exceed the daily rate prescribed by the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration in the case of travel within the \n     continental limits of the United States.\n       II. Incidental Expenses: The following items may be \n     authorized or approved when related to official travel:\n       1. Commissions for conversion of currency in foreign \n     countries.\n       2. Fees in connection with the issuance of passports, visa \n     fees; costs of photographs for passports and visas; costs of \n     certificates of birth, health, identity; and affidavits; and \n     charges for inoculations which cannot be obtained through a \n     federal dispensary when required for official travel outside \n     the limits of the United States.\n       III. Hearing Expenses (committees only)\n       A. In connection with hearings held outside of Washington, \n     D.C., committees are authorized to pay the travel expenses of \n     official reporters having company offices in Washington, \n     D.C., or in other locations, for traveling to points outside \n     the District of Columbia or outside such other locations, \n     provided:\n       1. Said hearings are of such a classified or security \n     nature that their transcripts can be accomplished only by \n     reporters having the necessary clearance from the proper \n     federal agencies;\n       2. Extreme difficulty is experienced in the procurement of \n     local reporters; or\n       3. The demands of economy make the use of Washington, D.C., \n     reporters or traveling reporters in another area highly \n     advantageous to the Senate; and further provided, that should \n     such hearings exceed five days in duration, prior approval \n     (for the payment of reporters' travel expenses) must be \n     obtained from the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n       IV. Witnesses Appearing Before the Senate (committees only)\n       A. The authorized transportation expenses incurred and \n     associated with a witness appearing before the Senate at a \n     designated place of examination pursuant to S. Res. 259, \n     agreed to August 5, 1987, will be those necessary \n     transportation expenses incurred in traveling from the \n     witness' place of residence to the site of the Senate \n     examination and the necessary transportation expenses \n     incurred in returning the witness to his/her residence.\n       B. If a witness departs from a city other than the witness' \n     city of residence to appear before the Senate or returns to a \n     city other than the witness' city of residence after \n     appearing before the Senate, then Senate committees may \n     reimburse the witness for transportation expenses incurred \n     which are less than or equal to the amount the committee \n     would have reimbursed the witness had the witness departed \n     from and returned to his/her residence. Any deviation from \n     this policy will be considered on a case by case basis upon \n     the written request to, and approval from, the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration.\n       C. Service fees for the preparation or mailing of passenger \n     coupons for indigent or subpoenaed witnesses testifying \n     before Senate committees shall be considered reimbursable for \n     purposes of official travel.\n       D. Transportation expenses for witnesses may be charged to \n     the Committee's official centrally billed government travel \n     charge card and paid on direct vouchers to the charge card \n     vendor. Additionally, per diem expenses for indigent \n     witnesses may be charged to the Committee's official \n     government charge card and paid on direct vouchers to the \n     charge card vendor.\n       V. Regulations Governing Payments and Reimbursements from \n     the Senate Contingent Funds for Expenses of Senate Committees \n     and Administrative Offices\n       (Adopted by the Committee on Rules and Administration on \n     July 23, 1987, as authorized by S. Res. 258, 100th Congress, \n     1st session, these regulations supersede regulations adopted \n     by the Committee on October 22, 1975, and April 30, 1981, as \n     amended.)\n       Section 1. Unless otherwise authorized by law or waived \n     pursuant to Section 6, herein, no payment or reimbursement \n     will be made from the contingent fund of the Senate for any \n     official expenses incurred by any Senate committee (standing, \n     select, joint, or special), commission, administrative \n     office, or other authorized Senate activity whose funds are \n     disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, in excess of $50, \n     unless the\n\n[[Page S11476]]\n\n     voucher submitted for such expenses is accompanied by \n     documentation, and the voucher is certified by the properly \n     designated staff member and approved by the Chairman or \n     elected Senate Officer. The designation of such staff members \n     for certification shall be done by means of a letter to the \n     Chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration. \n     ``Official expenses,'' for the purposes of these regulations, \n     means ordinary and necessary business expenses in support of \n     a committee's or administrative office's official duties.\n       Section 2. Such documentation should consist of invoices, \n     bills, statements, receipts, or other evidence of expenses \n     incurred, and should include ALL of the following \n     information:\n       a) date expense was incurred;\n       b) the amount of the expense;\n       c) the product or service that was provided;\n       d) the vendor providing the product or service;\n       e) the address of the vendor; and\n       f) the person or office to whom the product or service was \n     provided.\n       Expenses being claimed should reflect only current charges. \n     Original copies of documentation should be submitted. \n     However, legible facsimiles will be accepted.\n       Section 3. Official expenses of $50 or less must either be \n     documented or must be itemized in sufficient detail so as to \n     leave no doubt of the identity of, and the amount spent for, \n     each item. However, hotel bills or other evidence of \n     lodging costs will be considered necessary in support of \n     per diem expenses and cannot be itemized.\n       Section 4. Documentation for services rendered on a \n     contract fee basis shall consist of a contract status report \n     form available from the Disbursing Office. However, other \n     expenses authorized expressly in the contract will be subject \n     to the documentation requirements set forth in these \n     regulations.\n       Section 5. No documentation will be required for the \n     following expenses:\n       a) salary reimbursement for compensation on a ``When \n     Actually Employed'' basis;\n       b) reimbursement of official travel in a privately owned \n     vehicle;\n       c) foreign travel expenses incurred by official \n     congressional delegations, pursuant to S. Res. 179, 95th \n     Congress, 1st session;\n       d) expenses for receptions of foreign dignitaries, pursuant \n     to S. Res. 247, 87th Congress, 2nd session, as amended; and\n       e) expenses for receptions of foreign dignitaries pursuant \n     to Sec. 2 of P.L. 100-71 effective July 11, 1987.\n       Section 6. In special circumstances, the Committee on Rules \n     and Administration may require documentation for expenses \n     incurred of $50 or less, or authorize payment of expenses \n     incurred in excess of $50 without documentation.\n       Section 7. Cash advances from the Disbursing Office are to \n     be used for travel and petty cash expenses only. No more than \n     $5000 may be outstanding at one time for Senate committees or \n     administrative offices, unless otherwise authorized by law or \n     resolution, and no more than $300 of that amount may be used \n     for a petty cash fund. The individual receiving the cash \n     advance will be personally liable. The Committee on Rules and \n     Administration may, in special instances, increase these non-\n     statutory limits upon written request by the Chairman of that \n     committee and proper justification.\n       Section 8. Documentation of petty cash expenses shall be \n     listed on an official petty cash itemization sheet available \n     from the Disbursing Office and should include ALL of the \n     following information:\n       a) date expense was incurred;\n       b) amount of expense;\n       c) product or service provided; and\n       d) the person incurring the expense (payee).\n       Each sheet must be signed by the Senate employee receiving \n     cash and an authorizing official (i.e., someone other than \n     the employee(s) authorized to certify vouchers). Original \n     receipts or facsimiles must accompany the itemization sheet \n     for petty cash expenses over $50.\n       Section 9. Petty cash funds should be used for the \n     following incidental expenses:\n       a) postage;\n       b) delivery expenses;\n       c) interdepartmental transportation (reimbursements for \n     parking, taxi, subway, bus, privately owned automobile \n     (p.o.a.), etc.;\n       d) single copies of publications (not subscriptions);\n       e) office supplies not available in the Senate Stationery \n     Room; and\n       f) official telephone calls made from a staff member's \n     residence or toll charges incurred within a staff member's \n     duty station.\n       Petty cash funds should not be used for the procurement of \n     equipment.\n       Section 10. Committees are encouraged to maintain a \n     separate checking account only for the purpose of a petty \n     cash fund and with a balance not in excess of $300.\n       Section 11. Vouchers for the reimbursement of official \n     travel expenses to a committee chairman or member, officer, \n     employee, contractor, detailee, or witness shall be \n     accompanied by an ``Expense Summary Report--Travel'' signed \n     by such person. Vouchers for the reimbursement to any such \n     individual for official expenses other than travel expenses \n     shall be accompanied by an ``Expense Summary Report--Non-\n     Travel'' signed by such person.\n\n\n                Appendix A: The Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n       Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 492, agreed to \n     December 10, 1982, the Sergeant at Arms has the authority to \n     consider and ascertain and, with the approval of the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration, determine, compromise, \n     adjust, and settle, in accordance with the provisions of \n     chapter 171 of Title 28, United States Code (The Federal Tort \n     Claims Act), any claim for money damages against the United \n     States for injury of loss of property or personal injury or \n     death caused by negligent or wrongful act or omission of any \n     Member, Officer, or Employee of the Senate while acting \n     within the scope of his/her employment. Any compromise, \n     adjustment, or settlement of any such claim not exceeding \n     $2,500 shall be paid from the contingent fund of the Senate \n     on a voucher approved by the Chairman of the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration.\n       Payments of awards, compromises, or settlements in excess \n     of $2,500 are obtained by the agency by referring the award, \n     compromise, or settlement to the General Accounting Office \n     for payment.\n       Appropriations or funds for the payment of judgments and \n     compromises are made available for payment of awards, \n     compromises, and settlements under the Federal Tort Claims \n     Act.\n       However, any award under the Federal Tort Claims Act in \n     excess of $25,000 cannot take effect except with the prior \n     written approval of the Attorney General.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11476-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I seek recognition today to congratulate \nnational political correspondent and syndicated columnist David S. \nBroder on being awarded the U.S. Capitol Historical Society's 2006 \nFreedom Award.\n  This award, presented annually by the Capitol Historical Society \nsince 1993, recognizes and honors individuals and organizations that \nhave advanced greater public understanding and appreciation for freedom \nas represented by the U.S. Capitol and Congress.\n  Following the presentation of the award to Mr. Broder, retiring \nArchitect of the Capitol Alan M. Hantman's official portrait was also \nunveiled. Both of these men made brief statements. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record the following thoughtful remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\ndavid s. broder, 2006 united states capitol historical society freedom \n                   award recipient, november 29, 2006\n\n       It is an honor to stand in this room, where so much history \n     has been made. I appreciate the United States Capitol \n     Historical Society for inviting Ann and me for this ceremony, \n     and thank you for the privilege of being your speaker. I have \n     been coming up here for more than 50 years now, since I was \n     hired as a reporter by Congressional Quarterly, and every \n     time I come up Pennsylvania Avenue and see that magnificent \n     dome, my heart beats a little faster.\n       This building is majestic--far more so than the White House \n     at the other end of the avenue. But even more impressive over \n     the\n\n[[Page S11477]]\n\n     years have been the men and women sent here from 50 states \n     and 435 districts to struggle with the responsibilities \n     imposed by Article I of our Constitution.\n       Article I--because the legislative branch is fundamental to \n     our system of representative government. George Mitchell, \n     when he was the Senate majority leader, had a speech passage \n     I heard him deliver many times.\n       Senator Mitchell said, ``We have had executives from the \n     very beginning of human society, whether we called them kings \n     or emperors or dictators. But democracy began when the \n     Parliament established its independence from the crown, and \n     an independent legislature has always been the best guarantor \n     of freedom.''\n       We need to remember that--all of us, including those of us \n     in the press. And we need to treat the Congress as \n     respectfully and carefully as we do the president. I am not \n     suggesting that there is something wrong with close scrutiny \n     of congressional ethics--of the relations between lawmakers \n     and interest groups, or legislative practices such as \n     earmarks that steer money to favored individuals or groups.\n       But there ought to be parity. We know that presidents and \n     vice presidents accept entertainment from people with large \n     interests in government policy, and they raise large campaign \n     contributions from them. We know that the White House and \n     Cabinet departments steer money to their own favored \n     constituencies and politically vital areas--but we're somehow \n     less outraged by it. And we often let the president, \n     whichever party he may be, grab the credit for a notable \n     achievement at a bill-signing ceremony, even when we know \n     that the hard work has been done by legislators, often with \n     little help or even active opposition from the executive.\n       I have written--and I firmly believe--that Congress does \n     more for the press, with its hearings and with the myriad \n     individual briefings and conversations between lawmakers and \n     their aides and reporters, than any other part of \n     government--and generally receives less consideration from \n     the press in return.\n       One reason that Congress as an institution usually lags \n     behind the president in public approval--no matter how high \n     or low he may be at any given moment--is that Congress has no \n     one who speaks for it as an institution, while the president \n     has many spokesmen, all delivering the same message on any \n     given day.\n       But also, the process that makes Congress work when it is \n     working well is a process of slow negotiation and compromise, \n     and the tendency in the press, even in so-called \n     establishment news organizations, is to treat these \n     incremental, process stories as boring--so readers and \n     viewers have little idea what is happening in the day-to-day \n     work of the Congress. But I would be less than honest if I \n     did not also acknowledge that members of Congress themselves \n     find fault with the working of the legislative branch.\n       During this past year, I have heard more concern--and more \n     criticisms--from members of both parties than I can ever \n     recall. The public may have been saying earlier this month, \n     ``We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any \n     more.'' But I was hearing the same thing from inside these \n     halls for many months before Election Day. I would not \n     attempt to catalogue all the frustrations. But I have come to \n     believe that many of them are rooted in a structural problem \n     in our politics for which we have not found a solution.\n       Most of the political reform efforts in the past three \n     decades have aimed at the issue of money in politics. A few \n     have had useful effects. Reporting of contributions and \n     spending is now clearer and prompter. Also, I think it \n     healthy that members of Congress may no longer pick up the \n     phone and ask individuals or groups directly for six-figure \n     donations to their parties. But most of these campaign \n     finance reform efforts have been futile, when it comes to \n     reducing the influence of money on elections, or the burden \n     on candidates and officeholders in raising it.\n       Meantime, another problem has grown far more serious--and \n     is essentially unchecked. The introduction of computer \n     technology to the drawing of district lines in state \n     legislatures has changed the Congress in ways that are \n     detrimental to its health. So precise are the measurements \n     now available to the politicians drawing the lines that even \n     in a year of political upheaval, such as this one, a tiny \n     fraction of the House seats are really contested.\n       We saw a big turnover in the House this year, but about 375 \n     of the 435 members had no contest to speak of. What that \n     means is that the part of the national government that was \n     designed by the founders to reflect most immediately even \n     slight shifts in public sentiment has now become the part \n     most immune to change. And that, in turn, has changed the \n     dynamics of the House for the worse.\n       The inclination of members from safe districts is to play \n     to their political base--whichever group or ideology that may \n     be--and not look outside the base for allies or partners in \n     legislation. We have seen that tendency among Republicans \n     during their years of control, and we may now witness it \n     among Democrats.\n       In either case, it tends to make the House a more polarized \n     place--and less representative of the broad center of \n     American politics--than it could be or should be. I do not \n     know the answer to this problem. The Supreme Court has \n     declined to deal with political gerrymandering. The voters in \n     Ohio and California, when offered initiatives to take the \n     line--drawing authority away from the politicians in the \n     legislature and place it in more neutral hands, have said no.\n       It is not clear where to turn, but I would argue that this \n     issue--rather than further refinements of the campaign \n     finance system--should be at the top of the reform agenda. \n     Perhaps, California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the \n     Democratic legislature will revisit the question next year, \n     with some hope of finding a bipartisan compromise for a \n     reform that could serve as a model for other states.\n       Meantime, as Donald Rumsfeld might put it, we go to war \n     again come January with the Congress that we've got. I am \n     encouraged by the quality of some of the people in both \n     parties I met who were successful challenger candidates in \n     this election. But I am also keenly aware that, as always \n     happens in a wave election, some of the losers were people of \n     genuine talent and ability whose absence will be keenly felt.\n       Most of those who are sworn in here in January will have \n     more time ahead of them in office than the president has \n     remaining in his term. One can hope that they will bring that \n     long-term perspective to their work, and make the fight for \n     freedom and justice their goal, rather than the next \n     election. When people continually express low levels of trust \n     in Congress, it is not just a problem for the party in power. \n     It is a reflection on our whole system of representative \n     government--the greatest blessing a free people has ever \n     enjoyed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n  Hon. Alan M. Hantman, FAIA, Architect of the Capitol, United States \n Capitol Historical Society--Official Portrait Ceremony, November 29, \n                                  2006\n\n       Thank you, Chairman Ehlers, Senator Stevens, and the Joint \n     Committee on the Library for accepting my portrait into the \n     Capitol art collection, and thank you, Congressman Sarasin, \n     for that generous introduction. And I truly mean thank you.\n       I thank you and the United States Capitol Historical \n     Society, not only for the great honor paid to me in \n     commissioning this wonderful portrait and presenting it to \n     the United States Congress, but also for being such an \n     integral part of life here on Capitol Hill.\n       Thank you for serving as the institution that consistently \n     steps back from the day-to-day issues and taking the long \n     view--the historical perspective so important for putting \n     things in the context of the big picture of what we are all \n     about in this great democracy of ours.\n       The concept of the Freedom Award, so appropriately \n     presented to David Broder this evening, highlights for us the \n     underlying basics of freedom, democracy, and representative \n     government--the very foundations upon which our country is \n     built. Congratulations, Mr. Broder.\n       In looking at the mosaic of the past 10 years, I think \n     about the momentous changes we have seen here on Capitol \n     Hill. In fact, change appears to be the only constant on the \n     Hill.\n       As the tenth Architect of the Capitol, I have been acutely \n     aware of my stewardship responsibilities for the national \n     treasures under my care. The fundamental, yet very \n     challenging responsibilities of preserving and enhancing the \n     more than 300 acres of grounds and 15 million square feet of \n     buildings were critically impacted by post-9/11 security \n     requirements--and, in this respect we have, unfortunately, \n     lost much of our innocence as we try to strike the right \n     balance between security and openness.\n       The need to welcome visitors respectfully to ``the People's \n     House,'' to protect the Congress, the visitors, and the \n     Capitol itself, are the underlying reasons for constructing \n     the new Visitor Center. It is the Capitol's ninth increment \n     of growth in its 213 year history and, as Ron stated, \n     increases its overall size by another 70 percent.\n       The completion of the Capitol Visitor Center next year will \n     enable the millions who visit each year to be screened \n     respectfully and safely hundreds of feet from the Capitol. \n     They will be welcomed into a building that complements the \n     Capitol itself in its use of similar stonework, other quality \n     materials, and well-proportioned spaces that will stand the \n     test of time. Orientation films and a major exhibition area \n     showcasing artifacts and documents that highlight the flow of \n     our history and the aspirations of our nation will prepare \n     those visitors to tour the Capitol itself. These exhibits \n     offer the opportunity to learn about the Congress and, \n     hopefully, inspire young and old to get more involved in \n     their government.\n       I take great pride in this historic project and am honored \n     to work with the many hundreds of dedicated professionals and \n     tradesmen and women committed to bringing it to fruition next \n     year.\n       As Congressman Sarasin mentioned, the Capitol Visitor \n     Center is only one of the many AOC projects across Capitol \n     Hill, such as the ongoing Supreme Court renovation, the many \n     security and fire and life-safety projects, the Power Plant \n     modernization, and the recently-dedicated National Garden \n     project, and many projects for the Library of Congress, among \n     others. Integral to the success of these projects and the \n     day-to-day operations here on the Hill are the 2,000 people \n     who make up the Office of the Architect of the Capitol.\n       Each person on this hard-working team takes great pride in \n     their work and the many contributions they make every day \n     maintaining and operating this city within a city.\n\n[[Page S11478]]\n\n       Together, we have transformed this Agency over the last 10 \n     years into a cohesive and professional team that efficiently \n     and effectively supports and serves the Congress; an Agency \n     which will continue to do so for generations to come. It is \n     the people of the AOC that are the heart of this organization \n     and I am so very proud to have led the AOC team through these \n     challenging years of growth and change. I want to thank each \n     person for their dedication and commitment to excellence. \n     There are some people here tonight who have gone on to other \n     places--I thank you for your service to the AOC and the \n     Congress. There are also many of you here tonight who will \n     continue on with our mission, working with our Chief \n     Operating Officer Stephen Ayers and the next Architect of the \n     Capitol to continue our efforts as good stewards of these \n     national treasures. I wish you all well and I know that you \n     will continue to make me proud going forward.\n       I would also like to congratulate and thank Michael Shane \n     Neal for this truly sensitive portrait, including his \n     rendition of Thomas Ustick Walter's Dome, and the Frederick \n     Law Olmsted lantern as the framing elements of this work.\n       These were, of course, designed and built by those who went \n     before us--but they speak strongly to the continuity of the \n     Congress as our country has continued to grow, and the needs \n     of the Capitol have continued to evolve.\n       When Shane and I discussed possible settings for the \n     portrait, he photographed many alternative locations, but we \n     ultimately agreed that the symbolic action of my descending \n     the steps into the new Capitol Visitor Center with the Dome \n     and the lantern in the background would enhance this sense of \n     continuity.\n       I thank you, Shane, not only for being the fine artist that \n     you are, but also for your patience during multiple sittings \n     and the gracious hospitality you and Melanie extended to Roz \n     and me on our visit to your studio in Nashville. I also would \n     like to extend a special thank you to our Curator, Barbara \n     Wolanin, for assisting with the initial selection of Shane \n     and for lending her keen eye throughout the process.\n       As I look around this stately room that has itself \n     witnessed so many historic events, I see the faces of many \n     people who have been so important to me as Architect of the \n     Capitol, as a member of the Congressional, Washington, D.C., \n     and professional architectural communities, those who have \n     been my friends for decades, as well as members of my family \n     who have blessed me with their love and support through both \n     good and difficult times. And, I thank you personally, \n     Senator Warner, for being here this evening and for having \n     championed my candidacy what seems like so many years ago as \n     Chairman of the Senate Rules and Administration Committee.\n       At a wonderful moment like this, I can't help but think of \n     those who have gone before. . . . of my father who worked \n     nights in the Post Office. We often talked of things past and \n     the possibilities of the future when he came home from work \n     at 5 a.m., and I was still awake cramming for exams. My soft-\n     spoken mother supplemented the family income as a bookkeeper, \n     and enriched our lives through her artwork and her dreams.\n       I think of Roz's Mom and Dad, who lost so many loved ones \n     in the Holocaust, our grandparents who immigrated here--who \n     came through Ellis Island seeking a better life. I think of \n     their financial struggles and personal sacrifices and the \n     value they placed on strong family ties and education, and am \n     forever grateful for the legacies they have left to Roz and \n     me, our children, and grandchildren.\n       It is humbling to stand here today and to recognize and \n     appreciate the fact that Roz and I have taken part in the \n     flow of our nation's history in some small way. I am truly \n     honored to follow in the footsteps of the first nine \n     Architects of the Capitol as we unveil this portrait and see \n     it donated by the United States Capitol Historical Society to \n     the collections of the United States Congress.\n       Thank you all so very, very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11478-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11478-S11479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          Captain Jason Hamill\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to CPT \nJason Hamill, U.S. Army, 31, who grew up in Salem, CT.\n  Nearing the completion of a year-long tour in Bagdad, serving with E \nCompany, 3rd Battalion, 67th Armored Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, \nFort Hood, TX, Captain Hamill died of injuries sustained when his \nmilitary vehicle encountered an improvised explosive device.\n  Known for his sense of humor and as a bit of a mischief maker, he was \na proud family man. He followed in his father's footsteps serving in \nthe military with a deep, strong sense of purpose and belief in what he \nwas doing. Prior to entering the Army, Captain Hamill was a member of \nROTC at the University of Connecticut earning the respect of his fellow \nmembers and classmates, as well as his engineering degree. He lived as \na true patriot and defender of our great Nation's principles of freedom \nand justice serving in Afghanistan and Kosovo in addition to Iraq.\n  Captain Hamill is a true example of the powerful American spirit that \npermeates this Nation's history. He served as a messenger of high \njustice and idealism in the best tradition of American principles and \npatriotism. I am both proud and grateful that we have the kind of \nfighting force exemplified by Captain Hamill serving in the Persian \nGulf--and the strong families back at home sending their love and \nsupport.\n  He was a credit to his family, his community, his service, and his \ncountry. Our Nation extends its heartfelt condolences to his wife, \nKaren, who he just married last year, and his parents, Sharon and \nRichard. We extend our appreciation for sharing this outstanding \nsoldier with us, and we offer our prayers and support. You may be \njustifiably proud of his contributions which extend above and beyond \nthe normal call of duty.\n\n\n                     Corporal Adam A. Galvez, Usmc\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I rise in solemn tribute to CPL Adam \nA. Galvez of the Marines who gave his life in the service of his \ncountry during the global war on terrorism.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have had a chance to talk with Adam's \nmother Amy and his father Tony. They are wonderful people who are truly \nproud of their son. In speaking with them, I quickly learned just what \na hero Adam was.\n  A lot of people use that word ``hero'' today without thinking about \nwhat it really means. I like to define it as an individual doing \nextraordinary things that serve the greater good. Adam's actions \nclearly fit the bill.\n  For example, I understand that a month before his death, Adam was \nwounded while outside a building with several fellow marines after a \nsuicide bomber detonated an explosive device. The explosion caused the \nbuilding to collapse. Yet, instead of tending to his own wounds, Adam, \nbegan to dig, while under fire, for his fellow marines trapped in the \nrubble.\n  That is the mark of a true hero.\n  Accordingly, I am proud to say that the Salt Lake City Council \nunanimously voted to name a street in my hometown the ``Adam Galvez \nStreet.'' I cannot think of anything more appropriate.\n  I also want to acknowledge East High School sophomore Junior Cruz, \nwho as part of his Eagle Scout project came up with the idea of ``Adam \nGalvez Street'' and saw it through to its fruition.\n  I am blessed to live in a great State in the greatest country in the \nworld. When I learn about the lives of young heroes such as Adam \nGalvez, I am reminded that our true greatness lies in the sacrifice of \nsuch noble and brave service members.\n\n\n                Private First Class Daniel G. Dolan, Usa\n\n  Mr. President, on this the 65th anniversary of the attack on Pearl \nHarbor, I rise to pay tribute to a young American who gave his life to \nensure that our nation will never be attacked again. That young man's \nname was PFC Daniel G. Dolan.\n  Just 1 month before his 19th birthday, Private First Class Dolan \njoined the Army during a time of war. No doubt due to his \nprofessionalism, Private First Class Dolan was assigned to the 3rd \nBrigade of the 2nd Infantry Division which, of course, is the elite 1st \nStryker Brigade. This professionalism was also recognized when he was \nawarded, posthumously, the Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Combat \nInfantry Badge.\n  We, as a nation, are truly blessed to have such young men and women \nwho are willing to serve. Private First Class Dolan's life was short, \nbut from what I have read it was full. I understand that he was an avid \nhockey player and fan who played for Roy High School and was part of an \namateur hockey association. I also been told that standing up for what \nis right is something that Private First Class Dolan did since \nchildhood, standing up for his little sister and the other children in \nthe neighborhood. Most of all he was a wonderful son to his parents Tim \nand Fay Dolan.\n  I believe that his sister Michelle said it best: ``Everyone was proud \nof him. He just wanted to serve his country, to be there for his \ncountry . . . I think he was scared when he went to Iraq, but he really \nwanted to go and serve us all.''\n  Such words can only describe a hero.\n\n[[Page S11479]]\n\n                Second Lieutenant Scott B. Lundell, Uang\n\n  Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a true American hero, \n2LT Scott B. Lundell. Such a description is appropriate to describe \nLieutenant Lundell, who was killed in an ambush while training an \nAfghan Army patrol in Oruzgan Province, Afghanistan.\n  Lieutenant Lundell was by all accounts a first-rate officer. He had \nrisen through the ranks, first enlisting in 2004 at the age of 32 in \nthe Utah National Guard's 19th Special Forces Group and then graduating \nfrom Officer Candidate School.\n  Lieutenant Lundell truly felt a calling to serve, especially after \nthe events of September 11, 2001. I have read that his wife Jeanine \nremembers that he was not satisfied supporting the war from home but \nwanted to make a difference overseas, so much so that he did not wait \nfor the next deployment of his unit. Instead he volunteered for his \nfinal assignment, training the Afghan military. Upon learning of his \npassing, Lieutenant Lundell's brother-in-law said, ``He did not die \ndoing what he loved--he died doing what he felt passionately about.''\n  Lieutenant Lundell believed in the righteousness of cause so much \nthat when the youngest of his four children was born he named her \nLiberty.\n  I am humbled that I had the honor to represent such a patriot in this \naugust body.\n\n\n                        Major Marta Maltby, Usar\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to MAJ Marta Maltby, who died of \nnatural causes during her deployment with the 328th Combat Support \nHospital at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany.\n  This was the second time this intensive care nurse had deployed \noverseas during a time of war to care for our Nation's wounded. Major \nMaltby also deployed with the 328th during Operation Deseret Storm. \nAccordingly, she was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.\n  Recently, I was able to spend some time with Major Maltby's mother, \nduring an Army Reserve ceremony that, in part, honored the major. I \ndeeply appreciated this opportunity because I was able to learn just \nhow caring and remarkable a person Marta was, as a daughter, wife, and \nas mother to two grown children.\n  As I said at that ceremony, Major Maltby, and the rest of her unit, \ntook a glimmer of hope and made survival and recovery a reality for \nhundreds of our servicemembers. These are also words that describe a \ntrue hero.\n  Our thoughts and prayers go out to the Maltby family during their \ntime of grieving. May they find solace in knowing that the country \nappreciates the selfless dedication of their wife, daughter and mother, \nMAJ Marta Maltby.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11479-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11479-S11480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECONCILIATION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in fiscal year 2004 I initiated a new fund \nin the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act entitled ``Reconciliation \nPrograms.'' This fund is managed by the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment's Office of Conflict Management and Mitigation. In fiscal \nyear 2006 it was funded at $15 million, and its purpose is to support \nreconciliation programs and activities ``which bring together \nindividuals of different ethnic, religious and political backgrounds \nfrom areas of civil conflict and war.'' Our intent is to support \ninitiatives of organizations representing groups of people who have \nbeen in conflict with each other to promote better understanding and \nreconciliation.\n  This is a global program, and the funds have been allocated to \nsupport activities in countries in Latin America, Africa, Asia and the \nMiddle East. For reasons that should be obvious, the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict is the focus of many organizations in that region \nthat seek to bring representatives of both peoples together to build \ntrust, improve understanding, and find common solutions to the roots of \nthe conflict.\n  There are dozens of conflicts in the world, and $15 million is too \nlittle money to support all the meritorious reconciliation proposals. \nThis is particularly true in the Middle East. USAID has funded several \norganizations that bring together Israelis and Palestinians, but \nfunding constraints make it impossible to support every deserving \norganization. This unmet need is the subject of a recent op-ed in the \nPalestine Times which poses some important questions. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the article by Rabbi Michael Cohen, who has done \nextraordinary work in this area, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Palestine Times, Dec. 5, 2006]\n\n                      Palestinian Permits and NGOs\n\n                        (Rabbi Michael M. Cohen)\n\n       The day after Israel observed the 11th anniversary of the \n     murder of Yitzhak Rabin Haaretz summed up the Arab-Israeli \n     conflict, ``After more than six years of continuous fighting, \n     neither side appears to have given up the basic assumption at \n     the beginning of the Intafada. The Palestinians and the \n     Israelis are both still convinced the other side understands \n     only force.''\n       The latest cease-fire in Gaza, shaky at best with Qassam \n     Rockets still being fired into Israel, is a move in the right \n     direction to quell the use of force by both sides. The truth \n     is that for the past year we have not been moving closer to \n     peace between Israel and the Palestinians. King Abdullah has \n     said more than once that unless there is tangible movement \n     towards peace in the upcoming months this conflict will be \n     cursed to go on for decades.\n       The Talmud teaches a very profound lesson about the use of \n     force and power. In separate moments the prophets Daniel and \n     Jeremiah question how mighty is God. The Talmud responds with \n     equal audacity by stating that God's might can also be found \n     and experienced when God decides to withhold his might and \n     power! This is a lesson too often lost in this holy corner of \n     the world.\n       There are scores of NGOs across Israel and the Palestinian \n     Authority working together that understand that force will \n     never translate peace into realty. In the ebb and flow of \n     diplomacy these NGOs provide the only ongoing constant to \n     strengthen the majority of Israelis and Palestinians who \n     desire peace. At one time these organizations could apply for \n     Wye River and Israel Arab Peace Partners Program grants from \n     the US government. These have been cut from the US Budget so, \n     for example, organizations of the Alliance for Peace in the \n     Middle East (ALLMEP) are limited where they can find funds.\n       When attempts are made by ALLMEP to create a separate fund \n     for NGOs working to end the Arab-Israeli conflict they are \n     told by Congress that countries like Israel, Jordan, Egypt, \n     etc. already get billions in US aid, while other areas of \n     conflict get much less. The only way to create such a fund \n     would be to reduce aid, much of it military, to those \n     countries. One question that was not asked recently of Prime \n     Minister Olmert when he was in Washington was, ``Would you be \n     willing to have a few million dollars that Israel receives \n     shifted to support organizations that work towards \n     reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians?'' At \n     present the United States is spending $200 million a day for \n     the war in Iraq. Give these NGOs in the Palestinian-Israeli \n     conflict a few hours worth of that spending, and we would see \n     the Palestinian-Israeli conflict end in less than a year.\n       One of the key ingredients to reconciliation between \n     Israelis and Palestinians is the ability to meet each other. \n     For years now the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, \n     the premier teaching and research program in the Middle East \n     where future Arab and Jewish leaders are prepared to \n     cooperatively solve the region's environmental challenges, \n     has been unable to get permits for Palestinian students \n     outside of East Jerusalem to study on its campus. This \n     includes students who wish to, ``learn to use the environment \n     as an approach to peace-building between Palestinians and \n     Israelis.''\n       At present the Arava Institute has put together a coalition \n     that includes the office of U.S. Ambassador Richard Jones, \n     USAID, Members of the Knesset Orit Noked and Ami Ayalon, the \n     Middle East Division of the Israel Foreign Ministry, and \n     Gisha: the Center for the Legal Protection of Freedom of \n     Movement. This coalition is working to challenge the Israeli \n     policy of not issuing any new study permits for Palestinians, \n     who have security clearance, and who wish to study in Israel. \n     This policy flies in the face of the Agreement on Movement \n     and Access that was signed last year by the United States, \n     Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. Another question not \n     asked of Prime Minister Olmert, ``Are you willing to end this \n     blanket policy of no new study permits for Palestinians to \n     study in Israel?''\n       The author David Grossman, who lost his son Uri during the \n     war this past summer, poignantly addressed 100,000 Israelis \n     who gathered on the anniversary of Rabin's murder in Rabin \n     Square. Turning to Prime Minister Olmert he said, ``We have \n     no choice and they have no choice. And a peace of no choice \n     should be approached with the same determination and \n     creativity as one approaches a war of no choice. And those \n     who believe we do have a choice, or that time is on our side \n     do not comprehend the deeply dangerous process already in \n     motion.''\n       Prime Minister Olmert reached out to Palestinians a few \n     days ago when he spoke at the grave of Ben-Gurion and \n     reiterated his call for the establishment of a Palestinian \n     State next to Israel. We have had enough of words. What we \n     need is peaceful action to\n\n[[Page S11480]]\n\n     back up such words by both Palestinians and Israelis. An \n     affirmative answer by Prime Minister Olmert to the questions \n     raised above would signal a tangible seriousness about moving \n     the peace process forward, and would show a determination and \n     creativity that is so desperately needed. Similar action will \n     also need to come from the Palestinian side so that both \n     Israeli and Palestinians can move the peace process forward \n     and not backward.\n       Rabbi Michael M.

Mr. President, the crisis in Darfur demands a more \nrobust response. In July 2004, more than 2 years ago, the United States \nSenate declared genocide in Darfur. As the crisis has continued, as the \ndeath toll has mounted, it was hard to believe that the situation on \nthe ground could deteriorate further. Unfortunately, it has, and the \nrealities today are even worse than they were in July 2004.\n  As many as 4 million civilians have been uprooted from their homes, \nand by some accounts 400,000 people have been killed. Countless women \nand young girls are being violently and sexually abused. Escalating \nviolence is forcing the evacuation of many vital relief workers. These \nrealities are well documented. We have United Nations, U.N., reports, \nState Department reports, reports from our colleagues who have traveled \nto the region, and countless other reports that tell us what has \nhappened, what is happening, and who may be responsible.\n  In the face of this crisis, the response of many citizens, officials, \nrelief workers, and journalists has been impressive and inspiring. \nTheir courageous efforts are testimony to the great work that can be \ndone by individuals who act on their moral duty to end atrocities.\n  The Senate also has taken important steps. We have provided funding \nto African Union peacekeepers and to humanitarian workers; we have \nurged NATO assistance; we have encouraged the establishment of a no-fly \nzone; we have supported sanctions against the perpetrators of violence; \nwe have established Presidential accountability by requiring regular \nreports on Darfur; and we have demanded the appointment of a \nPresidential Envoy to Sudan. We must continue to shine a spotlight and \nto take action wherever possible.\n  But like many of my constituents, I am disturbed that the killings \nand rapes and violence continue. I fear that our efforts and those of \nmany Americans are not being complemented by equal efforts from our \nPresident. I again urge the administration to be more proactive and to \nturn the tables on Khartoum.\n  Khartoum repeatedly has committed to disarm the Jingaweit. In fact, \nthe Government of Sudan committed to do so long ago, in the summer of \n2004. To date, this promise remains unfulfilled. And this Spring, \nSudanese officials said that U.N. peacekeepers would be allowed into \nDarfur once a peace deal was agreed. This commitment has been broken \nalso. These abandoned promises may not be surprising in light of \nKhartoum's long history of intransigence. What is astonishing is that \nKhartoum has faced few consequences for these massive failures, and \nworse, that Khartoum still is being allowed to dictate the terms of \npeacekeeping and humanitarian efforts in Darfur.\n  I implore the administration to learn from this grim history, and to \nget one step ahead of the leaders in Khartoum. We must prepare for all \nscenarios, not just those we seek.\n  Going forward, our agreements with Khartoum must include some \n``teeth'' to incentivize compliance. We should remind Khartoum that we \nalready have good records of the crimes committed in Darfur and of the \nsuspected perpetrators. We also should pursue without delay all points \nof pressure that have been authorized by the U.N. Security Council. We \nmust demonstrate to Khartoum that continued intransigence will be more \npainful than cooperation.\n  As we pursue these measures with Khartoum, we should remind rebel \ngroups that they will be held accountable for violations of \ninternational law. In addition, we should work urgently with partners \nto stabilize eastern Chad and the Central African Republic.\n  I suspect that history will pass exacting judgment on all parties who \nhave acted insufficiently to end the suffering in Darfur. But history \nis a long way off for the people of Darfur, and I will continue to work \nurgently with colleagues towards peace in Sudan and the region. I urge \nthe President to work more proactively to end this unconscionable \ncrisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11480-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JASON LEE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a member of my \nstaff, Jason Christopher Lee, who has been recalled to active Federal \nservice as a member of the United States Army Reserve and will deploy \nin support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Jason joined my staff in February 2005, where he has done a \ntremendous job serving Virginians out of my Norfolk office. In \naddition, Jason is attending college at Old Dominion University, where \nhe is maintaining an excellent grade point average while studying \ncommunications.\n  I believe much of Jason's success is due to his distinguished service \nin the U.S. Army, where he has attained the rank of corporal and is \nresponsible for leading fellow soldiers into battle. This is not the \nfirst time Jason has answered the call of duty in support of our \ncountry. He has previously served in both Kosovo and Iraq, where he \nearned the Army Commendation Medal and was recognized as an outstanding \nsoldier. Indeed, Jason was originally scheduled to be discharged from \nthe Army prior to his Iraq tour, but he answered his country's call to \narms and was deployed to some of the most dangerous locations in Iraq \nin 2003 and 2004. Following this period, Jason was honorably discharged \nfrom the Army and was placed in the inactive reserve.\n  Though generals and admirals may be the public face of this war, it \nis servicemembers, such as Jason, who fill the ranks of our formations, \nwho carry out our Nation's policy on the deadly streets of Iraq, \nAfghanistan, and elsewhere. They do not complain about the hazardous \nconditions they face, but go on with the knowledge that this Nation \nrelies on them to fulfill their duty under all conditions. We owe them \nall a tremendous debt of gratitude for their selfless service.\n  Jason, I salute your courage and your unending personal sacrifice on \nbehalf of this country. I join your family and friends in wishing you a \nswift and safe return.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11480-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11480-S11483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAREWELL TO THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, as the time for my departure from the \nSenate draws near, on behalf of the greatest blessings in my life, my \nwife Susan, and my children, Tyler, Forrest, and Brooke, I wish to \nthank my colleagues for their many courtesies and friendships forged \nduring these past 6 years, and offer a few concluding reflections on \nour time here together, and the future of our Republic.\n  Our foremost senior statesman in Virginia, one who served with \nparticular distinction in this body--Harry Byrd Jr.--has observed that, \nwith the exception of the Presidencies of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin \nRoosevelt, no time in our Nation's history has been witness to more \nproblems and challenges of great magnitude than these past 6 years.\n  When I arrived here in January 2001, America was at peace--or so we \nthought. And then on the bright, blue sky morning of September 11, the \nskies suddenly darkened with clouds of smoke from the Pentagon, and the \nhorrific collapse of the World Trade Center Towers. And our world \nchanged forever.\n  When I arrived in this body, accompanying a change of Presidential \nadministrations, our challenges were mostly economic--or so we thought. \nOur prosperity was already slipping, but most forecasts were for a mild \ndownturn in the economy. That changed on September 11 as well.\n  A cascade of other great challenges soon followed in rapid \nsuccession--issues foreign and domestic, challenges locally and \nnationally, threats manmade and disasters decreed by nature.\n  Through all of these unprecedented storms, it was our responsibility \nto make careful, prayerful decisions for the safety, security and \nprosperity of the people of our country.\n\n[[Page S11481]]\n\n  I am particularly grateful to the people of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia for the opportunity to serve here--to give voice to their \nvalues and to fight for their future in this, the world's most \ndistinguished body.\n  We all understand and respect the will of the people--the owners of \nthe government--in our representative democracy that brings us here and \nthat may, at some point, take us away.\n  Sometimes winds, political and otherwise, can blow the leaves off \nbranches and break branches off trees. But a deep-rooted tree will \nstand and grow again in the next season.\n  And, if Providence accords it the right climate and nourishment, that \ntree will bear fruit for generations to come, and give life to other \ntrees.\n  I have been honored, first as Governor and now as Senator, to be a \npart of important initiatives that have borne fruit for the people of \nVirginia and America.\n  As Governor, we worked across party lines to accomplish the honest \nchange that Virginians had desired and deserved. We abolished the \ndeceitful, lenient parole laws, brought truth to sentencing, brought \nviolent criminals to justice, and reformed our juvenile justice laws.\n  Today, the crime rate is down, and thousands of good people are not \nvictims of crime, have not lost loved ones, have not had their lives \nshattered, because we stood strong for truth and justice, and our \nreforms bore fruit.\n  We also brought high academic standards, accountability and new \nresources to Virginia's education system. We stopped skyrocketing \ncollege tuition rates.\n  Our education reform initiatives quickly became models for other \nStates, and even for this body in enacting education reform legislation \nfor the nation.\n  These reforms, too, are bearing fruit today. Virginia students are \nlearning more and performing markedly better on both state and national \ntests. Our schools are no longer engaging in social promotion.\n  And with investments in higher education from the coalfields with \nAppalachian School of Law and School of Pharmacy, to the Institute in \nDanville, to southwest Virginia and Roanoke HEC's, to the Engineering \nSchool of VCU, to new leading-edge research at Virginia Tech, George \nMason, Hampton and other universities we are equipping young men and \nwomen to succeed in the ever-more-competitive global marketplace.\n  And we replaced dependency with dignity by reforming Virginia's \nwelfare laws. Now, 11 years later, our welfare rolls are still less \nthan half of what they were when I became Governor. Not only has that \nsaved the taxpayers of Virginia hundreds of millions of dollars--the \nfar more important impact is seen in the eyes of children who watch \nwith admiration and respect as their parents go off to productive, \nrewarding jobs rather than sit at home, collecting a check.\n  Nothing was more rewarding for me as Governor than to help ignite \nVirginia's economic renaissance. We sent a message to the world that \nVirginia was ``open for business''--we lowered taxes, reduced \nregulations, implemented prompt permitting, and recruited high-\ntechnology companies like IBM and Toshiba, Micron and Infineon--now \nQimonda--Oracle's east coast campus, and secured billions of dollars in \ninvestment in semiconductor fabrication plants for world-class \ncompanies.\n  Before we recruited those companies 10 years ago, there were no \ncomputer memory chips manufactured in Virginia. Today, computer memory \nchips have replaced cigarettes as Virginia's No. 1 manufactured export. \nWe're not just the ``Old Dominion'' anymore; now we're the ``Silicon \nDominion!''\n  When I came to the Senate, my goal was to use this perspective and \nexperience to continue and build on this work. I wanted to bring to our \nnational policies the same emphasis on education and innovation--the \nsame emphasis on economic opportunity--the same emphasis on protecting \nthe safety and security of law-abiding people--the same time-tested \nvalues--that had guided my governorship.\n  I have been able to do that, and I am grateful to many of you for \nworking in partnership with me on so many issues that are vitally \nimportant for the lives and safety and prosperity of our citizens.\n  Our time together has been full of challenge. But despite the broken \nbranches and shattered limbs and lives of 9/11, America has stood \nstrong like a live oak. We have relied on our roots as a freedom-loving \nnation. Out of these stormy times has grown a new national sense of \nurgency, resolve and mission. And this new spirit is bearing fruit \ntoday, and will for many years to come.\n  Yes, the people of America have grown impatient with the pace of this \nprogress. It is not easy during prolonged periods of national trial to \nsustain an attitude of optimism and a sense of purpose. Our foes know \nthis about democracies, and they seek to exploit it. But they will not \nsucceed.\n  We Americans, of so many faiths and so many backgrounds, share this \nspirit above all else: We believe in the positive impact that each of \nus can achieve during our time here on Earth. But our opponents have no \nsuch belief. They fear human freedom, and glorify the extinguishing of \nhuman life more than the fruitful living of it. They will not succeed \nin this great struggle because they are only destroyers, and the world \nbelongs to those who create.\n  The God who gave us life, and who presides over the affairs of all \nnature and all nations, endowed mankind with a powerful spirit of \ncreation, regeneration, and renewal.\n  The attackers of 9/11 thought they would kill our spirit, but they \nonly rekindled it. And, despite one of the most unsettled and \nchallenging times in our Nation's history, look at what we have to show \nfor it.\n  Our economy is displaying unprecedented strength. Unemployment is the \nlowest it has been in decades. Home values are significantly higher \nthan just a few years ago, and the stock market is at a record high \nlevel. The tax burden on our people is at a 20-year low, while Federal \ntax revenues are at all-time highs, and inflation is under control.\n  There has not been a single terrorist attack on American soil since \n9/11, and numerous major plots have been foiled. The al-Qaida \nleadership has been decimated, and instead of meeting the enemy here at \nhome, we have taken the fight to them in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and \nIraq and in locales that will never be known. Even with the world at \nwar against a lethal enemy of radical terrorist organizations, \nAmericans are safer today than on 9/11.\n  We must respectfully work with other countries in intercepting \nfinances, creatively collaborating in counterterrorism efforts to \nthwart and defeat terrorist activity throughout the world.\n  This war on terror has many fronts. And all of us are deeply \nconcerned about the lack of progress of the war on the Iraqi front. \nAlthough our principles and strategic goals have not changed, mistakes \nhave been made and progress has been too slow. We cannot continue to do \nthe same things and expect different results; we must adapt our \noperations and change our tactics to meet the evolving terrorist \nthreat. And the Iraqi people and their leaders must take control of \ntheir destiny.\n  Let us never forget, however, that our American troops are liberators \nwho have freed a people from a brutal dictator and regime. In so doing, \nthey and their families have made great sacrifices not only for the \nfreedom of Iraqis, but for the security of Americans. They more than \nanyone understand the consequences of failure in Iraq are far too high. \nLeaving Iraq as a safe haven for terrorists to launch new attacks will \nput America in mortal danger. Our troops should come home as soon as \npossible, but they should come home in victory--not defeat.\n  This global war on terror is still a work in progress, and much of \nthe work is difficult. But I will leave here in coming days with \nsatisfaction that so many of the crucial steps we took to meet the \nchallenges of the post-9/11 world have worked, and worked well.\n  The Patriot Act and other new and technologically sophisticated \ncounter-terrorism measures designed to protect our homeland are \nworking, and working well.\n  Our courageous men and women in uniform, an All-Volunteer military \nthat is the most powerful fighting force in the history of the world, \nis hard at work for us, and working well.\n  We have also worked well on the domestic front. And I take great \npersonal\n\n[[Page S11482]]\n\nsatisfaction from progress achieved on some major initiatives designed \nto make this a land of opportunity for all--measures that will help \nsecure a future of expanding opportunity for our children by making \nAmerica the world capital of innovation.\n  One area of focus for me has been preserving the Internet as a tax-\nfree individualized opportunity zone. The Internet is the greatest \ninvention since the Gutenberg Press for the dissemination of \ninformation and ideas, and one of America's greatest innovations for \neconomic growth and jobs.\n  So far the Federal Government has taken the right approach when it \ncomes to the Internet--by basically leaving it alone.\n  The American private sector is the best steward of the Internet. We \njust need to leave it alone and let it prosper as an engine for \neconomic progress--and with your help, that is what we have done. But \nthe need for action will return next year, and I hope you will extend \ninternet tax freedom so that avaricious State and local tax commissars \nare blocked from imposing an average 18 percent tax on monthly Internet \naccess bills.\n  We also made major progress in a realm few Americans understand, but \none that will transform their lives--nanotechnology. Teaming up with my \nhard-working friend across the aisle, Senator Wyden, we sponsored and \nyou approved legislation launching the National Nanotechnology \nInitiative. This is the single largest federally funded, multiagency \nscientific research initiative since the space program in the 1960s, \nand the revolutionary technology it yields may well rival the space \nprogram in its impact on our society and economy.\n  You have heard me say many times on this floor that they key to \ninnovation is education, and that we need to educate more scientists \nand engineers because they are the ones who will design and develop the \nground-breaking and life-changing inventions, innovations, and \nintellectual property of the future.\n  But today America is not tapping its full potential in math, science, \nresearch and innovation. Only 15 percent of those graduating from our \nengineering schools today are women; only about 6 percent are African-\nAmericans, and about 6 percent are Latinos. That is simply not enough, \nespecially when we are competing with countries that have literally six \nor seven times our population.\n  That is why I have worked with senators in both parties, Senators \nAlexander, Ensign, Bingaman, and others, as well as the independent-\nminded Senator Lieberman--for the National Innovation and PACE Acts, \nwhich will invest in wide-ranging scientific education and research, \ninduce capable students with scholarships, provide incentives for \nteachers and researchers, and take other steps to keep America on the \nleading edge of science and technology.\n  That is why I have been the lead Republican cosponsor of the \nPartnership Access to Laboratory Science Act with Senator Menendez, \nwhich will provide science education and laboratory grants for students \nin rural and low-income schools.\n  And that is why I have led the charge for legislation to help remedy \nthe opportunity divide at America's minority-serving institutions--the \nHBCUs, Hispanic-serving institutions, and tribal colleges. I am \ngrateful for the Senate's support for this initiative and hope it will \nvery soon become a reality.\n  All these initiatives I respectfully urge you all to pass and stay \nwith them until they become law. For my part, I will continue to \nadvocate for these incentives and this major national commitment to \nmake sure that the U.S. is indeed the world capital of innovation.\n  Investing in education and innovation is vital for our global \ncompetitiveness, and so is achieving energy independence. In fact, not \nonly is energy independence an economic necessity; it's also a national \nsecurity imperative. Our dependence on Middle Eastern oil limits our \nforeign policy options for addressing terrorism, tyranny and related \ngeopolitical issues.\n  We have made some important strides in accelerating the exploration \nand development of American energy supplies, including American oil, \nnatural gas, clean coal and nuclear power. And we have made notable \nprogress in hastening the research, development and deployment of \neconomically viable alternative and renewable sources of energy. But \nhere we must all agree that there is far more to be done.\n  The bottom line is we need more energy explored, produced, and grown \nin America, so that hundreds of billions of energy dollars stay in \nAmerica and are reinvested in America's economy for American jobs, \nAmerican competitiveness, and American national security, instead of \nhaving to worry about the whims of some dictator in the Middle East, or \nsome other hostile part of the world.\n  There are so many ways that what we have done here during the last \nsix years has made a positive impact on the opportunities facing \ncitizens all across our country.\n  In Virginia, whether it is the major port expansion at Craney Island, \nor funding for the Advanced and Applied Polymer Processing Institute in \nDanville, or the effort to assure that new development opportunities at \nFort Belvoir are matched by adequate transportation facilities whether \nit is educational research funding, or new resources for roads and mass \ntransit, or grants to make our communities safer, or in hundreds of \nother ways we have been able to have a major, positive impact on \npeople's lives all across the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  We have also broken down barriers to opportunity. My very first \nspeech on the Senate floor was on behalf of Roger Gregory's appointment \nas a federal judge on the esteemed Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that \nsits in Richmond.\n  Judge Gregory had been nominated at the end of President Clinton's \nterm, but he did not get a vote, and to become a judge he had to be re-\nnominated by President Bush. So my first speech was to call on my \nSenate colleagues to rise above partisanship, rise above process, judge \nRoger Gregory as a person, and give him the fairness of a vote.\n  You did so, and as a result, Judge Gregory is serving with \ndistinction on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the first African \nAmerican to serve on that esteemed appellate court.\n  For the good of our country, the Judiciary, and this Senate, I urge \nyou--regardless of the party in power here and at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue--to end the obstructionist practices that deny \njudicial nominees, or other nominees, the fairness of an up or down \nvote, and that deny the American people the accountability that the \nadvice-and-consent process should afford.\n  Miguel Estrada was a victim of this unfair obstructionism, although a \nmajority of Senators supported his confirmation. Let John Bolton be the \nlast victim of these unfair, obstructionist practices.\n  Our Constitution provides a better way; let's follow it.\n  Finally, during these times of war, we are all keenly aware of the \nsacrifice made by the men and women serving in our Armed Forces and \ntheir families. Virginia is home to more people serving in uniform than \nall but a handful of states, and so when a loved one is lost, we feel \nthe pain very directly, very personally. A grateful nation must support \nthe families of those who have fallen in defense of our liberty. That \nis why I introduced a bill in the first hours of the first days of this \n109th Session to increase the military death benefit from the paltry \namount of $12,420 to $100,000. I thank you for passing it, and I thank \nthe President for signing it.\n  At each step of the way, on this measure and so many others, I have \nnever worked alone. Always at my side, as a partner--but even more as a \ngracious mentor, wise counsel, constant encourager, occasional \ncorrecter, and unwavering friend--has been our state's senior Senator, \nJohn Warner.\n  He has been the epitome of the Virginia gentleman, the model of an \nhonest, hard-working Senator, and most of all, a true and loyal friend. \nI will leave here enriched immeasurably by this latest and best chapter \nin our partnership of several decades.\n  My friends and colleagues, as I prepare to take my leave, I am \nhumbled and so grateful for the tremendous honor and privilege that has \nbeen accorded to me by the people of Virginia. I am also full of \ngratitude for the opportunity to serve with you and for the many \ncourtesies you have extended to Susan and me along the way.\n\n[[Page S11483]]\n\n  I leave with many new and enduring friendships, with some valuable \nlessons learned, with unrestrained optimism about the potential of \nAmerica, about our nation's future, and with pride in our \naccomplishments together.\n  My friends, don't let these challenging times along our national \njourney divert your focus from what truly matters.\n  The tree of American liberty is as strong as ever. Our roots run deep \nto a wellspring of values as old as our Republic, indeed much older \nstill.\n  Four hundred years after our Nation's beginning at Jamestown, we are \nstill in the springtime of our life as a nation. Still planting seeds \nand bearing fruit. Still growing and creating. Still inspiring and \ninnovating. Still providing light and hope for people around the world \nseeking to escape the chains of tyranny, and embrace the blessings of \nliberty.\n  Indeed, the sun is still rising on a bright American morning!\n  And if we will keep the faith, no matter the challenges or choices, \ngenerations to come will remember and think well of us, for this: We \nnever gave up. We never backed down, and, we always stood strong for \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11483-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11483-S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMARKS TO THE GERMAN MARSHALL FUND CONFERENCE\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks, \ndelivered in a keynote address at the German Marshall Fund conference \non Monday, November 27, in Riga, Latvia, in advance of the NATO Summit, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you, Madam President [Dr. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, \n     President of the Republic of Latvia]. I appreciate your \n     thoughtful introduction and your generous hospitality. It is \n     a pleasure to be back in Riga and to deliver the keynote \n     address here at this important German Marshall Fund \n     conference. This conference and the participants it has drawn \n     are evidence of the deep respect the Fund merits throughout \n     Europe and North America.\n       In 1991 NATO stood at a crossroads. With the collapse of \n     the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, the Alliance could have \n     declared victory and disbanded. Instead, NATO chose to adapt \n     to the new security environment and build on its legacy of \n     being the most successful security and defense organization \n     in history.\n       Since that time, we have welcomed ten new members into the \n     Alliance and have begun a dramatic transformation of our \n     military capabilities. We have also undertaken missions in \n     the Balkans and Afghanistan that have extended the purpose of \n     the Alliance beyond the territorial defense of its \n     membership. However, while NATO is busier than ever, these \n     activities do not guarantee that the Alliance will remain \n     strong and relevant.\n       For nearly half a century, NATO was oriented toward \n     defending against an attack from the East by Warsaw Pact \n     forces. Today, NATO's posture is influenced by emerging \n     threats such as the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction, rogue states, terrorism, and genocide. The \n     security threats of the 21st century require NATO members to \n     deploy forces rapidly over long distances, sustain operations \n     for extended periods of time, and operate jointly as trans-\n     Atlantic partners with the United States in high intensity \n     conflicts. To be fully relevant to the security and well \n     being of the people of its member nations, NATO must think \n     and act globally.\n\n                        The Test of Afghanistan\n\n       This is evident in the NATO mission in Afghanistan. That \n     country presents a difficult environment, but NATO must be \n     resourceful, resilient, and ultimately successful. The \n     September 11 attacks were planned in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda \n     still operates there, and the fate of the country remains \n     inexorably tied to the Alliance. NATO's International \n     Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) is responsible for \n     security operations throughout all of Afghanistan.\n       In recent months, Taliban attacks have occurred with \n     greater frequency, coordination, and ferocity. They have \n     extended well beyond the South and East, where most of the \n     fighting has been located. Although the hunt for al-Qaeda \n     terrorists continues, the primary threat to the stability of \n     Afghanistan is Taliban insurgents who are challenging ISAF in \n     greater numbers, sowing dissent among Afghanis, cooperating \n     with the bourgeoning narcotics trade, and complicating \n     security efforts in ways that inhibit the rule of law and \n     reconstruction.\n       If the most prominent alliance in modern history were to \n     fail in its first operation outside of Europe due to a lack \n     of will by its members, the efficacy of NATO and the ability \n     to take joint action against a terrorist threat would be \n     called into question. Moreover, Afghanistan has a \n     legitimately elected government and a long-suffering people, \n     both of which deserve a chance to succeed without the threat \n     of violent upheaval.\n       It is imperative that NATO fulfills its commitments to \n     Afghanistan. The Alliance has found it difficult to generate \n     the political will to meet NATO objectives. The reluctance in \n     capitals to grant NATO requests for troops and resources have \n     complicated this process. Despite months of intensive \n     discussions, Supreme Allied Commander/Europe, General Jim \n     Jones, disclosed in September that NATO was 2,500 troops \n     short of the minimal commitment requested for ISAF. These \n     troops did not materialize until General Jones and other NATO \n     leaders publicly put Alliance nations on the spot for these \n     shortfalls.\n       Afghanistan has become a test case for whether we can \n     overcome the growing discrepancy between NATO's expanding \n     missions and its lagging capabilities. NATO commanders must \n     have the resources to provide security, and they must have \n     the flexibility to use troops to meet Afghanistan's most \n     critical security needs. Unfortunately, NATO capitals are \n     making the military mission even more difficult by placing \n     national caveats on the use of their forces. These \n     restrictions, coupled with troop shortages, are making ISAF a \n     less cohesive and capable force.\n       Similar problems are plaguing the NATO Response Force \n     (NRF), which is slated to be NATO's expeditionary fighting \n     unit. As is often the case, the lack of transport \n     capabilities is a glaring deficiency. I am hopeful that the \n     plan to establish a fleet of C-17s under the command and \n     control of NATO succeeds. To overcome these challenges and \n     similar ones, we must reverse the downward spiral of defense \n     budgets. Only a handful of members spend more than 2 percent \n     of their gross domestic product on defense. Good intentions \n     can only carry a military force so far--the NRF and other \n     NATO assets must have the equipment, training, and resources \n     to fulfill their mission.\n       I believe strongly that NATO is capable of meeting the \n     challenge in Afghanistan. NATO commanders have demonstrated \n     that they understand the complexity of the mission. They know \n     that success in Afghanistan depends on the attitudes of the \n     people, the progress of reconstruction, the development of \n     the economy and the building of civil institutions that can \n     deal with the narcotics trade, as much as it depends on \n     battlefield victories.\n       Most Afghanis have welcomed the advances in personal \n     freedom, political participation, and educational \n     opportunities that have come during the last five years. The \n     recent increase in violence in Afghanistan clearly is not \n     evidence of a popular uprising. But to the degree that there \n     is discontent, disillusionment, or fear among the Afghan \n     people due to their security situation, trust in the Afghan \n     government and NATO will dissipate. Insecurity stemming from \n     insurgent activity by Taliban forces has also caused Afghanis \n     in some regions to seek the protection of tribal leaders and \n     warlords, which in turn undercuts the authority of the Afghan \n     government and increases the risk of civil conflict between \n     tribal factions. Given these dynamics, we must dispel any \n     doubts about the commitment of NATO and the West to \n     Afghanistan's emergence as a stable and free society.\n\n                        The Centrality of Energy\n\n       NATO's challenges continue to come in new formations. We \n     have to understand not only the military configuration of \n     threats before us, but also the likely basis for future \n     conflict. The NATO alliance has been successful, not because \n     it fought wars, but because it prevented them. If the NATO \n     alliance is to be fully relevant to the security of its \n     members, it must expand beyond the mission of military \n     defense and begin to think about how to prevent the \n     conditions that will lead to war.\n       In the coming decades, the most likely source of armed \n     conflict in the European theater and the surrounding regions \n     will be energy scarcity and manipulation. It would be \n     irresponsible for NATO to decline involvement in energy \n     security, when it is abundantly apparent that the jobs, \n     health, and security of our modern economies and societies \n     depend on the sufficiency and timely availability of diverse \n     energy resources.\n       We all hope that the economics of supply and pricing \n     surrounding energy transactions will be rational and \n     transparent. We hope that nations with abundant oil and \n     natural gas will reliably supply these resources in normal \n     market transactions to those who need them. We hope that \n     pipelines, sea lanes, and other means of transmission will be \n     safe. We hope that energy cartels will not be formed to limit \n     available supplies and manipulate markets. We hope that \n     energy rich nations will not exclude or confiscate productive \n     foreign energy investments in the name of nationalism. And we \n     hope that vast energy wealth will not be a source of \n     corruption within nations that desperately ask their \n     governments to develop and deliver the benefits of this \n     wealth broadly to society.\n       Unfortunately, our experiences provide little reason to be \n     confident that market rationality will be the governing force \n     behind energy policy and transactions. The majority of oil \n     and natural gas supplies and reserves in the world are not \n     controlled by efficient, privately owned companies. Geology \n     and politics have created oil and natural gas superpowers \n     that nearly monopolize the world's oil supply. According to \n     PFC Energy, foreign governments control up to 79 percent of \n     the world's oil reserves through their national oil \n     companies. These governments set\n\n[[Page S11484]]\n\n     prices through their investment and production decisions, and \n     they have wide latitude to shut off the taps for political \n     reasons.\n       The vast majority of these oil assets are afflicted by at \n     least one of three problems: lack of investment, political \n     manipulation, or the threat of instability and terrorism. As \n     recently as four years ago, spare production capacity \n     exceeded world oil consumption by about ten percent. As world \n     demand for oil has rapidly increased in the last few years, \n     spare capacity has declined to two percent or less. Thus, \n     even minor disruptions of oil supply can drive up prices. \n     Earlier this year, a routine inspection found corrosion in a \n     section of BP's Prudhoe Bay oil pipeline that shut down 8 \n     percent of U.S. oil output, causing a $2 spike in oil prices. \n     That the oil market is this vulnerable to something as \n     mundane as corrosion in a pipeline is evidence of the \n     precarious conditions in which we live.\n       Within the last year and a half, the international flow of \n     oil has been disrupted by hurricanes, unrest in Nigeria, and \n     continued sabotage in Iraq. Al-Qaeda and other terrorist \n     organizations have openly declared their intent to attack oil \n     facilities to inflict pain on Western economies. We should \n     also recognize that NATO members are transferring hundreds of \n     billions of dollars each year to some of the least \n     accountable, autocratic regimes in the world. The revenues \n     flowing to authoritarian regimes often increase corruption in \n     those countries and allow them to insulate themselves from \n     international pressure and the democratic aspirations of \n     their own peoples. As large industrializing nations such as \n     China and India seek new energy supplies, oil and natural gas \n     may not be abundant and accessible enough to support \n     continued economic growth in both the industrialized West and \n     in large rapidly growing economies. In these conditions, \n     energy supplies will become an even stronger magnet for \n     conflict.\n       Under the worst case scenarios, oil and natural gas will be \n     the currency through which energy-rich countries leverage \n     their interests against import dependent nations. The use of \n     energy as an overt weapon is not a theoretical threat of the \n     future; it is happening now. Iran has repeatedly threatened \n     to cut off oil exports to selected nations if economic \n     sanctions are imposed against it for its nuclear enrichment \n     program. Russia's shut off of energy deliveries to Ukraine \n     demonstrated how tempting it is to use energy to achieve \n     political aims and underscored the vulnerability of consumer \n     nations to their energy suppliers. Russia retreated from the \n     standoff after a strong Western reaction, but how would NATO \n     have responded if Russia had maintained the embargo? The \n     Ukrainian economy and military could have been crippled \n     without a shot being fired, and the dangers and losses to \n     several NATO member nations would have mounted significantly.\n       We are used to thinking in terms of conventional warfare \n     between nations, but energy could become the weapon of choice \n     for those who possess it. It may seem to be a less lethal \n     weapon than military force, but a natural gas shutdown to a \n     European country in the middle of winter could cause death \n     and economic loss on the scale of a military attack. \n     Moreover, in such circumstances, nations would \n     become desperate, increasing the chances of armed conflict \n     and terrorism. The potential use of energy as a weapon \n     requires NATO to review what Alliance obligations would be \n     in such cases.\n\n                  Energy as an Article Five Commitment\n\n       We must move now to address our energy vulnerability. \n     Sufficient investment and planning cannot happen overnight, \n     and it will take years to change behavior, construct \n     successful strategies, and build supporting infrastructure.\n       NATO must determine what steps it is willing to take if \n     Poland, Germany, Hungary, Latvia or another member state is \n     threatened as Ukraine was. Because an attack using energy as \n     a weapon can devastate a nation's economy and yield hundreds \n     or even thousands of casualties, the Alliance must avow that \n     defending against such attacks is an Article Five commitment. \n     This does not mean that attempts to manipulate energy for \n     international political gain would require a NATO military \n     response. Rather, it means that the Alliance must commit \n     itself to preparing for and responding to attempts to use the \n     energy weapon against its fellow members. NATO must become a \n     reliable refuge for members against threats stemming from \n     their energy insecurity. If this does not happen, the \n     Alliance is likely to become badly divided as vulnerable \n     members seek to placate their energy suppliers. In fact, no \n     issue in the history of NATO is so likely to divide the \n     alliance in the absence of concerted action.\n       Article Five of the NATO Charter identifies an attack on \n     one member as an attack on all. Originally envisioned to \n     respond to an armed invasion, this commitment was the bedrock \n     of our Cold War alliance and a powerful symbol of unity that \n     deterred Warsaw Pact aggression for nearly fifty years. It \n     was also designed to prevent coercion of a NATO member by a \n     non-member state. We should recognize that there is little \n     ultimate difference between a member being forced to submit \n     to foreign coercion because of an energy cutoff and a member \n     facing a military blockade or other military demonstration on \n     its borders.\n       In preparing for such a commitment, NATO leaders should \n     develop a strategy that includes the re-supply of a victim of \n     an aggressive energy suspension. How would the Alliance shift \n     energy supplies and services to a member under such an \n     attack? What steps can NATO take now to ensure that we have \n     the infrastructure in place to respond to such an attack? \n     What steps are needed to diversify our energy sources and \n     supply routes to deter the use of energy as a weapon? \n     Alternatives to existing pipeline routes must be identified \n     and financial and political support for the development of \n     alternative energy sources is crucial. A coordinated and \n     well-publicized Alliance response would be a deterrent that \n     would reduce the chances of miscalculation or military \n     conflict. It would also provide a powerful incentive for \n     Member states to remain in the Alliance and for prospective \n     members to accelerate reforms necessary to qualify for \n     membership.\n       The energy threat is more difficult to prepare for than a \n     ground war in Central Europe. Troops, equipment, and supplies \n     can move along highways and over difficult terrain. Energy \n     supplies do not enjoy the same freedom of movement. \n     Developing a logistical response to an energy cutoff will \n     prove a complex challenge.\n       My friend, Mark Grossman, the former U.S. Under Secretary \n     of State for Policy, has proposed reviving the REFORGER \n     exercises of the Cold War. These exercises were carried out \n     to prepare for the massive troop and equipment re-supply \n     mission that would be required to thwart a Soviet attack. A \n     new REFORGER should focus on how the Alliance would supply a \n     beleaguered member with the energy resources needed to \n     withstand geo-strategic blackmail. This will not be easy or \n     comfortable for the Alliance. Members will be required to \n     tighten their belts and make hard choices. But, if we fail to \n     prepare, we will intensify our predicament.\n       Beyond constructing strong alliance commitments related to \n     energy, NATO must engage Russia and other energy rich \n     nations. I advocate establishing regular high-level \n     consultations between Russia and NATO on energy security. The \n     economic and political situation in Russia is intensely \n     influenced by the price of energy. Moscow is banking on big \n     returns from its energy sector indefinitely into the future. \n     But the fickleness of energy markets affects not only \n     consumers, but producers.\n       I believe that Russia has a long-term interest in achieving \n     a more prosperous stability that comes with greater \n     investment in its energy sector and the development of a \n     reputation as a trusted supplier. But its recent actions to \n     temporarily reduce gas supplies to the West, confiscate some \n     foreign energy investments, and create further barriers to \n     new investment are undermining confidence in Moscow's \n     reliability. This trend is likely to have unintended \n     repercussions for Russia. Even now, Russians are feeling the \n     effects of inadequate investment in their energy sector. \n     Russia boasts the world's largest reserves of natural gas, \n     but this winter it could face gas shortages of its own. \n     Russia has not contended with investment problems in its \n     natural gas industry, and its artificially low domestic gas \n     prices have undermined the development of efficiency measures \n     that are commonplace in the West. Russia now requires gas \n     imports from Central Asia, which it sells at a premium to \n     Europe. Yet if growing domestic demand in Russia outstrips \n     stagnating production and Central Asian imports, as some \n     commentators predict, the Kremlin will face the difficult \n     choice between letting some of its people go cold or not \n     meeting its commitments to Europe.\n       We do not wish these difficulties on anyone. But we should \n     speak clearly with Russia about our concerns and our \n     determination to protect our economies and our peoples. We \n     should outline the differences between a future in which \n     Russia tries to leverage for political advantage the energy \n     vulnerabilities of its neighbors and a future in which Russia \n     solidifies consumer-producer trust with the West and respects \n     energy investments that help expand and maintain Russia's \n     production capacity. Energy is a two-way relationship and \n     will remain so even as Europe and the United States diversify \n     their energy resource base. Both NATO and Russia need a \n     sustained discussion on the rule of law, the status of \n     foreign investment, bi-national and multinational agreements, \n     and steps to implement the principles agreed to at the G-8 \n     Summit in July.\n\n                       Expanding NATO's Partners\n\n       One critical element in strengthening the alliance's energy \n     security is developing new relationships and admitting new \n     members who will contribute to NATO's efforts in this area. I \n     applaud Alliance efforts to develop special relationships \n     with states around the world. At the Riga Summit, NATO should \n     authorize the creation of partnerships with like-minded \n     countries such as Japan, Australia, South Korea, Finland, and \n     Sweden.\n       An effective energy strategy should also include new \n     strategic relationships with energy exporters. I urge \n     Alliance leaders to look to the Caucasus and Central Asia for \n     new partnerships. These states are critically located and are \n     important sources of oil and natural gas. Substantial \n     improvement is needed in the region in areas such as \n     democracy, the rule of law, and civil society. A closer \n     relationship with NATO will promote these values and \n     contribute to our mutual security. I recommend that NATO \n     focus especially on its relationships with Azerbajian and \n     Kazakhstan. While both countries have considerable work to \n     do, eventual NATO membership must be on the table.\n       I believe that some aspirant states are prepared to assume \n     membership responsibilities. Croatia, Albania, and Macedonia\n\n[[Page S11485]]\n\n     should be invited to join NATO as soon as they meet Alliance \n     requirements. Each has expressed a strong desire to join the \n     Alliance, and each is capable of making important \n     contributions. While I am disappointed that invitations will \n     not be extended here at Riga, we must increase the tempo of \n     cooperation between the Alliance and those states.\n       NATO should also invite Georgia to join the Alliance. \n     Tbilisi is a young democratic government, resisting pressure \n     from breakaway republics backed by Moscow and Russian troops \n     on Georgian soil. Georgia has been a superb role model for \n     the region, and it is host to critical segments of the Baku-\n     Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and the Southern Caucuses natural \n     gas pipeline. Two months ago, the NATO Secretary General \n     announced that the Alliance had launched an Intensified \n     Dialogue with Georgia. While this is an important step, NATO \n     must grant a Membership Action Plan as soon as possible.\n       After recovering from recent political instability, Ukraine \n     has indicated that it wants to move more slowly toward NATO \n     membership. I am pleased that Kiev has acknowledged the \n     important work needed to accurately convey to its population \n     what NATO membership would mean. While I hope this process \n     might move more quickly, I urge the Alliance, when all \n     applicable criteria are satisfied, to support efforts for \n     Ukraine to join NATO.\n       The Alliance must also continue to encourage Belgrade to \n     meet its international obligations, which include full \n     cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the \n     former Yugoslavia. With additional progress on war criminals \n     and other important reforms, Serbia would be a valuable \n     member of the Alliance.\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       By their nature, alliances require constant study and \n     revision if they are to be resilient and relevant. They must \n     examine the needs of their members and determine how the \n     alliance can safeguard the freedom, prosperity, and security \n     of each member. NATO has survived and prospered because it \n     has been able to do this repeatedly. We have met the threat \n     of Soviet aggression, expanded the zone of peace and security \n     across Europe, guarded against the risks posed by terrorism \n     and weapons of mass destruction, and improved our ability to \n     project power over long distances. We are meeting threats in \n     Afghanistan, the African continent, and other locations \n     outside Europe. But if we fail to reorient the Alliance to \n     address energy security, we will be ignoring the dynamic that \n     is most likely to spur conflict and threaten the well-being \n     of alliance members.\n       I understand that adopting energy security as a mission is \n     a major advancement from NATO's origins. But it represents an \n     historic opportunity to change the circumstances of \n     geopolitics to the benefit of all members. At this summit, we \n     should engage in a broad, strategic debate on how we can \n     ensure progress in Afghanistan, strengthen NATO through new \n     members, and face the energy security threats of the 21st \n     century together. Although Riga may not produce definitive \n     answers to these questions, it must be the summit that starts \n     the crucial discussion that will lead to consensus.\n       The stakes are such that if we wait even a few years, we \n     are likely to find that our alliance is in jeopardy. We will \n     look back at this point in time and see it as a critical \n     juncture that required bold vision and leadership. I look \n     forward to working together with each of you to provide this \n     leadership.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11485-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CAMERON GULBRANSEN KIDS AND CARS SAFETY ACT\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I submit to the Record my disappointment \nthat the Senate failed to consider S. 1948, The Cameron Gulbransen Kids \nand Cars Safety Act to improve the child safety features in new \nvehicles.\n  Nearly every other day, a child dies in the United States from a \ncompletely preventable tragedy--backed over by a driver who could not \nsee behind their vehicle, strangled in a power window, or killed when \nan automobile inadvertently shifts into gear. The average age of \nvictims in these cases is just 1 year old. In 70 percent of cases, a \nparent, relative, or close friend is behind the wheel.\n  Safety is something every family deserves, and it is not a partisan \nissue. I have been proud to work with Senator Sununu of New Hampshire \nas my partner on this legislation. We have met with families from our \nStates and listened to parents share their heart-wrenching experience \nof losing a child.\n  The Gulbransens are one such family. Two-year-old Cameron was killed \nwhen he slipped outside unnoticed by his mother and babysitter and \ntoddled behind the SUV his father was backing into the driveway. It is \nin memory of Cameron and the hundreds of children like him that we \nintroduced bipartisan legislation to take steps we know can reduce \nthese accidents. The Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars Safety Act will \nhelp to ensure that America's cars are properly equipped to prevent \nthese tragedies from happening to others.\n  While the auto manufacturing industry has tried to make some changes \nto address these issues, this bill is timely and urgently needed. As \nparents, we do all we can to keep our children safe. As legislators, we \nshould do the same to protect our Nation's children.\n  I am committed to reintroducing the Cameron Gulbransen Kids and Cars \nSafety Act in the 110th Congress and will work vigorously to ensure \nthat safer cars mean safer kids across America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11485-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF LINDA L. STOLL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the service of \nLinda L. Stoll, who has been an employee of the Federal Government for \nnearly 34 years, including 21 years with the National Park Service. \nSince July 2000, Ms. Stoll has been the superintendent of Wind Cave \nNational Park in South Dakota. Wind Cave is the fourth longest cave in \nthe world.\n  Ms. Stoll began her career with the Government in the 1970s with the \nGeneral Services Administration in Denver. Over the course of 12 years \nin the agency, she held several positions, starting as a c1erk \nstenographer and ultimately becoming personnel management specialist \nwith the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Miami, FL.\n  In 1985, she accepted a position with the National Park Service as \nsupervisory personnel management specialist at Everglades National \nPark. It was the first of what were to be many posts in an extensive \nand highly regarded career. In 1988, she became superintendent of what \nis now Pecos National Historical Park. Also prior to coming to Wind \nCave, she was assistant regional director for program review in the \nIntermountain Regional Office of National Park Service.\n  As the superintendent of Wind Cave for 6 years, Ms. Stoll took the \nlead in shepherding the park through 10 environmental assessments and \none environmental impact statement. The purpose of these exercises was \nboth to be sure park resources were being protected, and to ensure the \nsafety of those visiting the park. The results of this work were an \narray of construction projects and new wildlife management plans. Her \ningenuity helped to preserve the wonderful Wind Cave system and the \nmixed-grass prairie that is also under her jurisdiction.\n  Ms. Stoll will be retiring on January 3, 2007 and intends to stay in \nthe Hot Springs area. Though her day-to-day presence at the park will \nbe greatly missed, her years of hard work are appreciated by the \nvisitors of Wind Cave and all those who care about protecting this \nnational treasure. I applaud Ms. Stoll's service and thank her for her \ntime and efforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11485-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11485-S11486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MARK KEENUM\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate that my long-time staff member and current chief of staff, \nMark Keenum, who has served my office and the Senate so well for the \npast 17 years in a manner which reflects great credit on the Senate, \nhas been nominated by President Bush to be Under Secretary of \nAgriculture for Farm and Foreign Agricultural Services.\n  His confirmation by the Senate will give him an opportunity for \ncontinued public service that will benefit all Americans. I do not know \nof another person who would bring any better qualifications to this job \nthan Mark Keenum. He has an agriculture economics undergraduate degree \nfrom Mississippi State University and also received graduate degrees \nfrom that university, including a Ph.D. After completing his studies, \nMark served on the faculty at Mississippi State as an instructor and \nwas actively engaged in research in emerging agriculture and \naquaculture areas of interest in our State.\n  In 1989 Mark joined my staff here in Washington as a specialist in \nagriculture and agriculture economics. He has been an outstanding \nmember of my staff, both in helping to develop policy initiatives and \nin monitoring all the legislation affecting the Department of \nAgriculture. In my duties as a member and later Chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, he provided very\n\n[[Page S11486]]\n\nvaluable advice and assistance in shaping policy there. He was actively \nengaged in the successful completion of several farm bills. Mark worked \nto craft the language, negotiate, and iron out differences in \nconference with the House. He has communicated closely with the \nadministration over the years, all in a very professional and \nthoughtful way.\n  Mark and his wife Rhonda are close friends of mine. Mark's personal \nqualities are impeccable. He is courteous and intelligent; he works \nhard, has a strong sense of responsibility, and has good judgment. I \nappreciate the way he has helped manage the administrative and \nlegislative functions of my office, as well as the counsel he has \nprovided me for the past 17 years.\n  I am confident that Mark will do an excellent job in helping develop \noptions for the next farm bill.

FIALA\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Frank Fiala, \nsuperintendent of the Keweenaw National Historical Park. After nearly \n32 years of Federal service, Frank will be retiring in January. Frank's \nservice to our country began in the U.S. Air Force where he worked as a \nmedic from 1969 to 1973. His career then transitioned to the National \nPark Service, where he has worked to protect our country's natural and \nhistoric treasures and to make them available for the public's \nenjoyment and appreciation. Frank's National Park Service career \nincluded assignments at the Lake Clark National Park and Preserve in \nAlaska, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve in Alaska, Rocky \nMountain National Park in Colorado, Carlsbad Caverns National Park in \nNew Mexico, and Dinosaur National Monument in Colorado.\n  For the past 10 years, Frank has served as superintendent of the \nKeweenaw National Historical Park in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, \nworking to preserve and interpret the region's copper mining history. I \noffer this tribute to Frank because of my 10 years of personal \nexperience working with Frank and witnessing his passion and enthusiasm \nfor Keweenaw's rich mining history of immigration, labor, vibrant \ncultures, and changing technologies.\n  Frank has been an extraordinary park superintendent at Keweenaw. \nFrank has successfully navigated the challenges of managing a park that \nowns less than 10 percent of the land within the park boundaries and \nrequires partnering with a variety of public and private organizations. \nA significant milestone was reached with the completion of the park's \nGeneral Management Plan, which Frank shepherded. Development of the \nplan was at times contentious and involved incorporating viewpoints \nfrom multiple stakeholders, including local citizens, businesses, \nlandowners, entrepreneurs, corporations, educational institutions, \nfoundations, and government agencies.\n  Frank has been an enthusiastic advocate for the park, promoting the \nKeweenaw Peninsula's historic and cultural riches and envisioning the \npark's role in the future economic development of the region. Where \nsome saw ruined, dilapidated buildings as eyesores, Frank saw them as \nopportunities. To preserve the historic landscape of copper country, \nFrank secured funding to make several significant property \nacquisitions, including the Quincy Mining Company's Pay Office; the \nCalumet and Hecla Mining Company General Office Building, which is now \nthe Park Headquarters; the C Library, which now houses the park's \nextensive archival collections; C Warehouse No. 1, and the Union \nBuilding.\n  A true preservationist, Frank successfully fought to stop the \nreplacement of the city of Quincy's historic water tower, a vital part \nof the region's cultural landscape, with an underground storage tank. \nFrank personally researched and produced the original plans for the \nhistoric water tower, and now a replicated water tower stands proudly, \nproviding water service to the area's residents and preserving a key \nfeature of the Keweenaw landscape.\n  In addition to preserving historic buildings, Frank also helped save \na large collection of artifacts from the Calumet & Hecla Mining \ncompany, which is being cared for and catalogued by one of the Nation's \nfinest professional staff of archivists, curators, and museum \ntechnicians. Since Frank's arrival, the park's museum collection has \ngrown from nothing to over 300,000 historic items.\n  As anyone who has had the opportunity to drive through the park with \nFrank knows, Frank truly is a visionary. One is quickly transported \nback in time to the 19th century, when the Keweenaw produced 85 percent \nof the Nation's copper. Frank makes the history of ``copper country'' \ncome alive: the sounds of the immigrants arriving, the smells of \npasties wafting from lunch pails descending into the deep mine shafts, \nthe tremors from the strikes of 1913 caused by unfair labor conditions. \nHis enthusiasm in relation to rehabilitating and interpreting the \nhistoric properties scattered across the park is contagious. Thanks to \nFrank, visitors to the Keweenaw can truly experience what it was like \nto be part of the mining community during the industrial revolution.\n  Frank's dedication to preserving and interpreting the history of the \nKeweenaw, and his many years of public service is truly an example to \nothers. His enthusiasm, vision, and proactive approach have given the \npeople of Keweenaw, MI and our Nation a great gift.\n  Thank you, Frank, for your service, and congratulations on your \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11486-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MONTE ZUCKER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Since then, he has worked \ntirelessly to transform that venerable institution from a printing \nagency into a 21st century digital information processing facility. \nAfter a period of factfinding and consultation with GPO's stakeholders, \nhe issued a strategic vision for the GPO's future that has guided the \nmanagement of the agency ever since.

He led efforts to modernize the GPO's plant \noperations supporting Congress. He assisted the State Department's \ndevelopment and issuance of the new electronic U.S. passport and has \nled efforts to further enhance the GPO's security and intelligent \ndocuments operation. He worked with the library community to ensure the \ncontinued transition to predominately\n\n[[Page S11487]]\n\nelectronic Federal Depository Library Program and began a pilot project \nto test the GPO's ability to digitize retrospective Government \npublications for online public access. Throughout his tenure, Bruce has \nensured that we have the products and services we need to conduct our \ndaily business in Congress.\n  In carrying out this program of change, Bruce brought to the GPO a \nbroad range of business principles and practices, earning him the title \nof 2006 Civilian Executive of the Year from Government Computer News. \nHe instilled a new focus on customer service for Congress and the \ndepartments and agencies that depend on the GPO and has provided new \nservice options that make it easier and more convenient to use the GPO. \nHe turned around the financial status of the agency, posting a positive \nfinancial performance every year since 2004 and reversing a pattern of \nprevious losses that has provided the agency with the capital to make \nmuch-needed investments in technology. He brought aboard a wide range \nof experts in technology and systems integration, finance, marketing, \nsecure and intelligent documents, digital media, and related fields, to \nguide the GPO forward. And to his credit, Bruce brought before the \nCongress the issue of how best to utilize the GPO's aging and outsized \nbuildings for its future operations.\n  Mr. President, Congress, Federal departments and agencies, and all \nthose among the public who rely on the GPO have been well served over \nthe past 4 years by Public Printer Bruce James. His unceasing call for \ntechnology modernization and his steadfast adherence to business best \npractices will leave a legacy of continued improvement at the GPO for \nmany years to come. As Bruce departs the GPO to return to retirement in \nhis beloved Nevada, he leaves with our best wishes and the thanks of a \ngrateful nation for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11487-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JERRY M.

Mr. President, two Sundays ago, when Marcelle and I were \nat mass at Holy Trinity at Georgetown, we listened to a homily about \nthe life of Angelo D'Agostino, SJ. I had been thinking about Father \nD'Ag, as those of us knew him called him, since I had received word \nfrom his dear friend Ben Palumbo that he had died. Ben and Madge \nPalumbo were wonderful friends to Father D'Ag, as they have been to \nMarcelle and me.\n  As Father Kevin O'Brien noted while talking about the home Father \nD'Agostino began in Nyumbani, Kenya, Father D'Ag worked tirelessly to \nraise money, especially for abandoned HIV-positive children. His \nNyumbani village was designed to hold together families, where most \nmembers had lost their normal family cohesiveness because of deaths \nfrom AIDS. So many of us, like my friend Senator Dennis DeConcini and \nothers, always responded when the Palumbos asked us to go to fund-\nraisers to raise money for the work Father D'Agostino was doing \nthroughout Africa. I told some of his fellow Jesuits that we long ago \ndecided that we would do whatever Father D'Agostino wanted--eventually \nhe'd make sure we would anyway, so we might as well do it graciously to \nbegin with. Nothing fazed him when he was asking for others. He always \nwent out of his way to remind Senator DeConcini, Ben Palumbo, and me \nthat we shared Italian heritage. I once told him, ``Angelo, no matter \nwho you were seeking help from, you would find something to connect \nyou, and that would be the reason to do it.'' I remember his laugh to \nthis day.\n  The beauty of Father D'Agostino and the saintly nature of him was \nthat he never asked for anything for himself--it was always for others. \nHe gave a voice to those who had no voice, and he leaves a great gap in \ntheir lives.\n  Even the President of Kenya and his wife attended the funeral to \nexpress his sorrow for the death of Father D'Agostino. He told the \nboard members and others at the funeral that they must carry on Father \nD'Ag's work. He said, ``I am sure that is the assurance Father \nD'Agostino would have liked. He founded these homes and wanted to \nsucceed in reducing the prevalence and effects of HIV/AIDS. You should \ntake the responsibility of ensuring that Father D'Agostino's work \ncontinues.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article by Joe Holley of The \nWashington Post about Father D'Agostino be printed in the Record, as \nwell as an article from the official website of the President of Kenya.\n  For my part, I feel blessed for having known Father D'Ag and I mourn \nhis loss.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Angelo D'Agostino; Priest Aided HIV-Positive Orphans\n\n                            (By Joe Holley)\n\n       The Rev. Angelo D'Agostino, 80, a physician, psychiatrist \n     and Jesuit priest who opened one of the first orphanages for \n     abandoned HIV-positive children in Kenya, died Nov. 20 of \n     cardiac arrest at the Karen Hospital in Nairobi. He had been \n     hospitalized for a week with abdominal pain from \n     diverticulitis and died after surgery.\n       Father D'Agostino, who practiced and taught psychiatry in \n     Washington during the 1970s and '80s, was called to a country \n     with more than 1 million children whose parents have died of \n     AIDS. Many of the children, often HIV-positive themselves, \n     have been abandoned or left to roam through Kenya's big-city \n     slums.\n       He encountered the needs of Kenya's children while serving \n     on the board of governors for a large orphanage in 1991. When \n     the orphanage began receiving scores of abandoned children \n     who tested HIV-positive, Father D'Agostino suggested setting \n     up a facility for them. The board opposed the idea, so in \n     1992, he founded the Nyumbani Orphanage, beginning with three \n     HIV-positive children.\n       Today Nyumbani, or ``home'' in Swahili, shelters about 100 \n     Kenyan children, from newborns to 23-year-olds.\n       The larger nonprofit organization, also called Nyumbani, \n     includes Lea Toto (Swahili for ``to raise the child''), a \n     community-based program founded in 1998 to provide outreach \n     services to HIV-positive children and their families in the \n     Nairobi area. Nyumbani also has the most advanced blood \n     diagnostic laboratory in Kenya.\n       At the time of his death, Father D'Agostino, an \n     indefatigable fundraiser, had just returned from Rome and the \n     United States, where he had solicited money for Nyumbani \n     Village, a self-sustaining community to serve the orphans and \n     elderly left behind by the ``lost generation'' of the AIDS \n     pandemic. The goal of the village, which has plans for 100 \n     houses, a school, a clinic and a community center, is to \n     create new blended families for orphaned children under the \n     care of elderly adults.\n       ``It was difficult to say no to him, particularly because \n     what he asked you to do were the kinds of things your \n     conscience would bedevil you about if you said no,'' said \n     Benjamin L. Palumbo, a Washington attorney who serves as \n     president of Nyumbani's U.S. board of directors.\n       Father D'Agostino's friends and orphanage supporters ran \n     the political gamut, from\n\n[[Page S11488]]\n\n     former Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) to Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-\n     Vt). Leahy called him ``a living saint''\n       Short and rotund, ``Father D'Ag,'' as some knew him, was \n     quick to laugh but also had a temper, his friend James \n     Desmond recalled. Desmond, former owner of a downtown bar \n     called Beowulfs, one of the priest's haunts when he lived in \n     Washington, recalled being with him in a meeting with \n     congressional aides who were giving him the polite brushoff. \n     When the priest realized what was happening, Desmond had to \n     hustle him out the door before his temper got the best of \n     him.\n       In 2001, Nyumbani became the first place in Africa to \n     import deeply discounted AIDS drugs under an Indian \n     pharmaceutical company's program to make such drugs more \n     affordable on the continent where most of the world's AIDS \n     patients live and die.\n       ``I am sick and tired of doing funerals,'' Father \n     D'Agostino told The Washington Post, explaining why he was \n     willing to defy national regulations and international patent \n     rules to buy cheaper, generic AIDS drugs.\n       ``It's really the darker side of capitalism, the greed that \n     is being manifest by these drug companies holding sub-Saharan \n     Africa hostage,'' he told The Post. ``People are dying \n     because they can't afford their prices.''\n       He also sued the Kenyan government for its policy banning \n     HIV-positive children from the nation's public schools. He \n     won that suit last year, which allowed more than 100,000 \n     children to rejoin their classmates in schools across the \n     country.\n       Angelo D'Agostino was one of six children born to Italian \n     immigrants in Providence, R.I. His younger brother, Dr. \n     Joseph D'Agostino of Fairfax, recalled that he had asthma as \n     a child, so he spent a lot of time reading, making model \n     airplanes and growing plants and flowers in the family's back \n     yard.\n       He received his undergraduate degree in chemistry and \n     philosophy from St. Michael's College in 1945 and his medical \n     degree from Tufts University in 1949. He received a master of \n     science degree in surgery from Tufts in 1953.\n       He served in the Air Force from 1953 to 1955 as chief of \n     urology at Bolling Air Force Base. After attending a retreat \n     with the Knights of Columbus, he decided to enter the \n     priesthood in 1954, although the Jesuits at Georgetown asked \n     him to take a year before making a final decision.\n       ``The Jesuits couldn't use a urologist or kidney stone \n     specialist,'' his brother recalled, ``so they told him to go \n     into psychiatry.''\n       After a psychiatric residency at Georgetown from 1959 to \n     1965 and further work at the Washington Psychoanalytic \n     Institute from 1962 to 1967, he became one of the first \n     American Jesuits to be trained as a psychiatrist. (He liked \n     to say he had ``more degrees than a thermometer,'' a nephew \n     recalled.)\n       He was ordained in 1966, earlier than expected because the \n     Jesuits were concerned that he was going to succumb to lupus, \n     an illness he had battled his whole life.\n       He taught psychiatry at Georgetown University and George \n     Washington University and in 1972 founded the Center for \n     Religion and Psychiatry at the Washington Theological Union \n     to promote dialogue between the two. From 1983 to 1987, he \n     was in private practice in the District. A number of his \n     clients were police officers, many whom he met over beers at \n     Beowulf's.\n       Father D'Agostino helped administer refugee centers in \n     Thailand and East Africa in the 1980s, but it was the lost \n     children of Kenya who captured his heart and wouldn't let go. \n     They called him ``Faza.''\n       He retired when he turned 80, ``but it was retirement with \n     a small `r,' ``Joe D'Agostino said. ``He still went to the \n     office every day, although he was happy he didn't have to go \n     to meetings anymore.''\n       He will be buried in Kenya. His brother, his only immediate \n     survivor, recalled that Father D'Agostino had only one regret \n     about his adopted homeland: ``He couldn't grow good tomatoes \n     over there. Being a good Italian, that was important to \n     him.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n    President and First Lady attend Father D'Agostino's Requiem mass\n\n       President Mwai Kibaki and First Lady Lucy Kibaki Monday \n     joined other mourners for the requiem mass for Rev. Father \n     Angelo D'Agostino at the Consolata Shrine Catholic Church in \n     Westlands, Nairobi.\n       The mass was conducted by Nairobi Archbishop Ndingi Mwana \n     A'Nzeki.\n       Addressing the congregation, President Kibaki urged Kenyans \n     to emulate Father \n     D'Agostino and assist the less fortunate in the society.\n       He called on board members of Nyumbani Children's Home, Lea \n     Toto and Nyumbani Village in Kitui to carry on with Father \n     D'Agostino's work, ensuring that the homes are well \n     maintained and succeed in serving the HIV/AIDS orphans.\n       President Kibaki said: ``I am sure that is the assurance \n     Father D'Agostino would have liked. He founded these homes \n     and wanted them to succeed in reducing the prevalence and \n     effects of HIV/AIDS.''\n       ``You should take the responsibility of ensuring that \n     Father D'Agostino's work continues,'' the Head of State said.\n       Paying tribute to Father D'Agostino, the First Lady \n     described him as a colleague in her work of caring for \n     orphans and in the fight against HIV/AIDS in the country.\n       She pointed out that Father D'Agostino played a pivotal \n     role when she was setting up the Kenya Chapter of the \n     Organization of African First Ladies Against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA) \n     by introducing her to key people and institutions helping in \n     the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n       As the patron of Nyumbani Children Homes, the First Lady \n     reassured the orphans that she will continue working hard to \n     provide them with the resources they need.\n       The First Lady recalled conversations she had with U.S. \n     President George W. Bush during a state dinner in Washington \n     when the U.S. leader hailed the work done by Father \n     D'Agostino in assisting vulnerable members of the Kenyan \n     society.\n       The mass was also attended by the Pope's representative in \n     Kenya Archbishop Alain Paul Lebeaupin among others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11488-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11488-S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO RON RUPP\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to recognize \nan outstanding Vermont public servant who goes above and beyond to \nadvocate for better laws and protection to keep children safe from lead \npoisoning--the No. 1 environmental health threat affecting young \nchildren in the United States.\n  Ron Rupp serves as the current director of the Vermont Housing and \nConservation Board, VHCB, Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Program and \nhas played a major role in securing more than $10 million in HUD funds \nfor the State of Vermont for lead hazard control efforts. Having been \nwith this program since its inception in 1994, Ron has worked to expand \nthe availability and quality of training and assistance for landlords \nand homeowners in order to reduce the hazards of lead poisoning caused \nby lead-based paint. Under his leadership, the program has provided \ncomprehensive technical and financial assistance to make Vermont \nproperties lead-safe. In addition to direct intervention, Ron has \nworked to expand education outreach efforts for the public on lead \npaint hazards, including training of construction and service workers, \nas well as property owners, and on the importance of testing young \nchildren for lead poisoning.\n  Ron's fight against childhood exposure to lead hazards is not limited \nto the State level. He has worked closely with the National Center for \nHealthy Housing to increase the overall body of knowledge on effective \ncontrol of lead hazards and coauthored two papers on research into lead \nhazard control methods. Considered an expert on lead and environmental \nhealth, he has served as a reviewer for HUD's Lead Paint Safety Guide \nand other HUD documents.\n  The most common cause of lead poisoning is exposure to dust from \ndeteriorated lead-based paint, the foremost cause of childhood lead \npoisoning, in old homes and buildings. Children are most frequently \nexposed to miniscule lead dust particles from chipping, peeling or \nflaking paint that cling to toys, fingers and other objects, leading \nyoung children to ingest the particles. Poisoning can also come from \nsources such as soil containing lead from car exhaust, water pipes, \nlead-glazed ceramic dishware, and plastic mini-blinds.\n  Too much lead in the body can cause damage to the brain, kidneys, \nnervous system and red blood cells. According to data from the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, more than 1 million children living \nin the United States between the ages of 1 and 5 years have \nunacceptably high levels of lead in their blood, which may result in \nlearning disabilities, reduced intellectual ability, behavioral \nproblems, or other health problems. Poor children are at special risk \nbecause inadequate nutrition increases lead absorption by the body.\n  Ron's job is by no means an easy one, but he has done exceptional \nwork advocating for better policies and practices so that Vermont's \nchildren can grow up in lead-free homes. My home State has the seventh \noldest housing stock in the Nation--a real ``Lead Leader.'' In the city \nof Burlington alone, housing units occupied by low-income residents \nconstitute the highest concentration of older homes in Vermont. \nSignificant lead paint hazards are characteristic of the deteriorated \ncondition of many of these buildings. The result is that Burlington has \na childhood lead poisoning rate that is more than double the national \naverage.\n  Through the hard work of Ron and the VHCB Lead-Based Paint Hazard \nReduction Program, Vermont is becoming a place where our children can \ngrow up safe from lead poisoning. The\n\n[[Page S11489]]\n\nremoval of lead hazards from our old homes and buildings is a slow \nprocess and success can be long in coming, but with dedicated public \nservants like Ron I have no doubt that success will indeed be met. \nThank you, Ron, and congratulations to you for making Vermont's Lead-\nBased Paint Hazard Reduction Program the continuing success it is \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11489-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF SAM WHITEHORN\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a member of my \nstaff who will be leaving the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation after more than 15 years working for this \ninstitution and more than 25 years of service to the American public. \nSam Whitehorn has been my deputy staff director and general counsel on \nthe Commerce Committee during the 109th Congress, but he has worked \ndiligently for the committee's membership and many of our predecessors \nduring more than a decade as senior counsel on the Aviation \nSubcommittee. I know Senators Jay Rockefeller, Fritz Hollings, and \nWendell Ford hold Sam in the highest regard for his commitment to this \ninstitution and his efforts to pass legislation that established the \nUnited States as a world leader in aviation and transportation policy.\n  Sam's reputation as an expert and dogged proponent of aviation \nsecurity, safety, and economic viability is known to everyone in the \naviation community. His ability to negotiate and work in a bipartisan \nfashion has served the committee honorably, allowing aviation \nlegislation to consistently move responsibly and timely. His \naccomplishments speak well of him: he has been involved in the passage \nof six Federal Aviation Administration Authorization, FAA, \nreauthorization bills during his tenure. While Sam has more recently \nexpanded his reach to other major aspects of the Commerce Committee's \nagenda, aviation continues to have a special place in his heart.\n  This country and the aviation industry also have benefited from Sam's \ncommitment to public service and his expertise on the issues during one \nof our most difficult times in modern history. After the horrible \nattacks of September 11, 2001, he helped lead the passage of the \nAviation and Transportation Security Act, which established the \nTransportation Security Administration, TSA. That legislation was \ninstrumental in restoring public confidence in our aviation system.\n  He also played a central role in the development of legislation that \ncurrently funds the aviation system, efforts to advance the \nmodernization of the National Airspace System, NAS, and promoted \nworkplace reforms at the FAA which have helped place the agency on a \nmore economically viable path. To put it simply, Sam Whitehorn's name \nis synonymous with aviation safety, security, and viability.\n  Prior to working for the Senate Commerce Committee, Sam worked at the \nU.S. Department of Transportation, DOT, as a senior attorney in the \nOffice of the General Counsel for Regulations and Enforcement where he \nrepresented the DOT on a host of aviation issues. Before that he was a \nstaff attorney in the antitrust section of the Civil Aeronautics Board, \nCAB, the precursor to the FAA.\n  While Sam has a passion for aviation and has been truly devoted to \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, nothing has been more important to him \nthan his family. From his upbringing in New Hyde Park, NY, to the many \nyears he has spent in his adopted hometown of Washington, DC, his \nclose-knit family has been vital to his success. We have seen his \ndedication to his wife Carol, who has been extremely patient at times, \nand more recently saw him watch proudly as his son Michael and daughter \nZoe went off to college. We greatly appreciate their willingness to \nshare Sam with us for these many years.\n  As Sam retires from the Senate, we wish him nothing but the best. He \nwill be missed, but his legacy will remain strong as we continue to \ntackle aviation issues in the future. I and this institution will miss \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11489-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RETIRING U.S. ATTORNEY CHARLES LARSON, SR.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \noffer my sincerest congratulations and gratitude to retiring U.S. \nAttorney Charles ``Chuck'' Larson, Sr. While I could easily just focus \non all Chuck has done in his years as the dedicated U.S. attorney for \nthe Northern District of Iowa, this man has given so much more in over \n40 years of Government service.\n  When his country has called, Chuck has been there. He served in the \nU.S. Army and Army Reserves for 40 years, retiring as a lieutenent \ncolonel in 1989. Four U.S. Presidents have called on Chuck to serve in \nvarious capacities, and each time he has stepped forward and served \nwith honor and distinction.\n  Chuck was first appointed as the U.S. attorney for the Northern \nDistrict of Iowa by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 and continued to \nserve in this position under President George H.W. Bush through 1993. \nDuring his service at this post, Chuck went well above and beyond. He \ndevoted himself to fighting the scourge of drug crime and abuse by \nbringing local, State, and federal agencies together. Chuck also \nrecognized the need for community outreach, and he pioneered a number \nof programs that brought together community leaders, clergy, and \ncitizens to explore approaches to reduce drug abuse in Iowa.\n  These ideas were recognized as very innovative at the time and led to \nPresident Clinton's call for Chuck to serve on the Commission on Drug-\nFree Communities, a post in which Chuck served with distinction and \nwhich his son, Chuck, Jr., fills today.\n  Following the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Chuck was again \ncalled to duty as the U.S. Attorney in the Northern District of Iowa by \nPresident Bush. He continued his aggressive and innovative strategies \nin this new and complex era of the war on terror. His efforts led to \nprograms for the training of law enforcement and other emergency \nresponders in dealing with and preventing terrorist attacks. Chuck \nextended this training effort to private industry and trade \nassociations. Yet Chuck never ceased his efforts in Iowa in fighting \ncrime and drug abuse. His past successes in community outreach programs \nand law enforcement coordination led to the creation of programs such \nas the ``Weed and Seed'' initiative in Cedar Rapids and the statewide \n``Meth and More'' program. These programs not only helped put criminals \nbehind bars but also provided help and support to thousands trapped in \nthe destructive cycle of methamphetamine abuse and educated Iowa \ncommunities about the disastrous effects of drug abuse. His devotion to \nthis cause can be summed up in Chuck's own words, ``if we can save one \nlife, then our efforts are a success.''\n  In the midst of this, his country called yet again. In 2004, Mr. \nLarson was ask to serve as the senior Department of Justice \nrepresentative in Iraq. Chuck was given the enormous task of directing \nand administering efforts to train Iraqi judiciary, law enforcement, \nand civilian contractors. He was tasked with nothing less than \nrestoring justice and equity to the Iraqi judicial system.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service of Katie \nGumerson Altshuler, my staff director at the Senate Republican policy \ncommittee. Katie has decided to return to her native Oklahoma and begin \na new life as chief of staff to the Speaker of the House of the \nOklahoma Legislature.\n  Katie became staff director of the RPC earlier this year, in what was \nthe culmination of an impressive climb through the ranks of Senate \nstaff leadership dating back to 1995 when she served as an intern for \nSenator Don Nickles when she was still in college. When Katie graduated \nfrom Sweet Briar College 2 years later, Senator Nickles hired her first \nas a staff assistant and then as a legislative correspondent. And in \n1999, he promoted her into the majority whip's office, where she \nquickly became well known in the Capitol as a floor assistant and \npolicy adviser to Republican Senators.\n\n[[Page S11490]]\n\n  When Senator Nickles finished his term as majority whip, I was \nthrilled that Katie agreed to join me as my first deputy staff director \nof the Republican policy committee. In that capacity, she quickly \nbecame my eyes and ears here in the Capitol Building, tracking the ins \nand outs of floor activity, representing the RPC within the leadership, \nand doing everything she could to ensure that only the best policy--\ngood, conservative Republican policy--became law. As one of her many \nduties, you may recall that she developed our RPC ``getaway'' materials \nand stood over by the side door to my right and handed them to \nRepublican Senators after the last vote of the week.\n  Katie quickly earned my trust, as I know she had earned the trust of \nSenator Nickles before me. So it was an easy decision to promote Katie \nto staff director of the RPC in June 2006. She had experience in a \nbroad range of policy areas and she understood the pulse of this body \nbetter than most ever will. My staff has enormous respect for her, and \nshe is a natural leader.\n  Katie's departure coincides with the end of my 4 years chairing the \nSenate Republican policy committee, a job I have enjoyed immensely. I \nwant to thank Katie for the consistently good work product she helped \nus achieve during these past 4 years. She has inspired other staff \nmembers of the committee to achieve a level of excellence that, I \nbelieve, has been of great value to Senators and their staffers. My \ngoal, since day one, was to make sure we produced a first-rate \nproduct--thorough, accurate, and reliable. Katie understood this, and \nshe made sure it happened. And so we both depart the policy committee--\nI for the chairmanship of the Republican Conference and she for the \nOklahoma State House--I believe we have left it well-prepared and well-\narmed for the future.\n  Let me share a few words about Katie personally. We all know Katie to \nbe bright, quick-witted, fiercely loyal, and genuinely warm to those \naround her. She is a true patriot who cares deeply for this Nation and \nthe Senate, and I know she is proud to have served here for the past \n9\\1/2\\ years. She loves and reveres this institution, even its \neccentricities. For example, a former colleague of hers remembers \nfondly how irritated Katie can become when the decorum of the Senate is \noffended, even when it is a Senator who fails to take seriously the \nSenate Chamber's dress code.\n  When contacted a few days ago, Katie's former boss, Senator Don \nNickles, had this to say about her: ``Katie brought a great deal of \nprofessionalism and enthusiasm into both the Whip office and Policy \nCommittee. She will certainly be missed.''\n  Eric Ueland, now chief of staff to Majority Leader Frist, worked with \nKatie for several years in the Nickles whip office. He said: ``No one \nshould ever mistake Katie's grace and charm for indifference to \nconservative philosophy or Republican ideology, because within her \nbeats the heart of a lion and the ferocity of a tiger. Katie always \nharnesses the very best from her colleagues to bring creative solutions \nto bear. She always seeks to suggest the best way forward to do credit \nnot just to the Senators she serves, but to the values that brought \nthem to Washington.''\n  One more accolade. Dave Schiappa, the secretary for the majority, who \nhandles all floor operations for the Republicans and who has worked \nwith Katie for many years, had this to say: ``Over my 22 years, I have \nhad the privilege to work with a great number of intelligent and \ndedicated people. Katie Altshuler is one of those shining stars and has \nset a standard of professionalism and devotion to the Senate as an \ninstitution.''\n  I wish Katie could be convinced to stay and help us in the Senate, \nbut I know that the pull of home and of new challenges is a strong one, \nand I wish her well in her new endeavors. So, Katie, my best wishes to \nyou as you take up your new line of duty, and on behalf of the Senate, \nI commend you for your excellent work. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11490-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11490]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     100TH BIRTHDAY OF CLAUDE WOOD\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, today I offer a few words in \nobservance of the passing of novelist Bebe Moore Campbell, a most \ninfluential American writer and a leading advocate for people living \nwith mental illness.\n  I extend my deepest sympathy and most sincere condolences to Ms. \nCampbell's family, especially her husband, Ellis Gordon, Jr.; her \nmother, Doris Moore; and her daughter and stepson, Maia and Ellis \nGordon III. My thoughts and prayers go out to them as they struggle \nwith the death of a woman they loved dearly.\n  In an illustrious career spanning 20 years, Bebe Moore Campbell was \nan extraordinarily perceptive author who tirelessly explored the \nAmerican experience through a variety of perspectives. Growing up in \nboth the North and the South in the 1950s and 1960s, she experienced \nfirst hand the numerous ways in which fear and hatred are manifested in \nthe form of racial segregation and oppression. She learned about living \namid injustice, about the rage and sorrow it imparts, and about the \ndignity and resolve required to overcome it.\n  Ms. Campbell drew much of her inspiration and strength from the \nstrong bond she had with her parents. Her second book, ``Sweet Summer: \nGrowing Up With and Without My Dad,'' is a loving tribute to the warmth \nof extended family and friends, the strong women in her life who helped \nmold her character, and the heroic example of her father, whose \nperseverance after a car accident left him a paraplegic taught her \ncourage and independence. The importance of family dynamics would be a \nguiding theme in Ms. Campbell's work and stimulated her interest in the \nintricate nature of relationships.\n  As Ms. Campbell continued to explore the parent-child relationship, \nshe also delved into the complexities that exist between and within \ngenders, races, and communities. She produced two critically acclaimed \nnovels in the first half of the 1990s set against the backdrop of \nhistorical instances of racial violence: ``Your Blues Ain't Like Mine'' \nand ``Brothers and Sisters.''\n  In these novels, Ms. Campbell explored the issues of race, class, and \ngender and personalized them in the form of characters we related to \nand cared for. Courageous and exceptionally talented, she captured the \nsocial and historical forces that cut through out society and divide \nus. She graphically demonstrated how America's racial, economic, and \ngender fault lines cut through the lives of individuals, often forcing \npeople into difficult and painful conflicts with others as well as \nthemselves.\n  Ms. Campbell focused in her later writings on the issue of mental \nillness. With passion and emotional depth, she explored the horrible \nconsequences of mental illness and the strain that it places on those \nwho love and depend on people suffering from a mental condition. Her \nwork has helped to raise our Nation's consciousness about the issue and \nhas made an invaluable contribution to our society's efforts to improve \nthe lives of people living with mental illness. Ms. Campbell was a \nfounding member of the Inglewood branch of the National Alliance for \nthe Mentally Ill, and her children's book ``Sometimes My Mother Gets \nAngry'' won that organization's Outstanding Literature Award for 2003.\n  In her work, Ms. Campbell illustrated how oppression and injustice \ndehumanizes everyone involved. She challenged and inspired us to \nexamine our preconceptions and fears and to open our hearts and minds \nto those around us.\n\n[[Page S11491]]\n\nHer powerful voice will be dearly missed, but her legacy cannot be \ndiminished. I am confident that her spirit will carry on in the \ncountless others whose lives she has touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11491-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING CAPTAIN JOHN C. CARMICHAEL\n\n Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nspecial anniversary year for a true patriot, a great American and \nfellow Georgian, Captain John C. Carmichael, U.S. Navy, Retired. \nFriends and family back home on St. Simon's Island know him as Jack.\n  As a teenager, Jack Carmichael had aspirations of attending West \nPoint, his desire being to follow in the great GEN Robert E. Lee's \nfootsteps. However, his father died in 1928 when he was only 14 years \nold, leaving his two younger brothers and his mother Kate with heavy \nhearts and tough decisions. At the time, they were living in \nJacksonville, FL. Kate did not think that schools in Jacksonville or \nWaycross, GA, where they had lived and from where Jack's father hailed, \nwere adequate to prepare him for the academic rigors of the service \nacademies; therefore, she made the decision to move the family to \nWashington, DC, to live with two aunts in order for Jack to acquire the \nrequisite education. He attended Western High School and several \nmilitary academy preparatory schools. During that time he became \nreacquainted with his cousin, John Harllee, who convinced him that the \nNaval Academy was the better path, so Jack reset his goal for \nAnnapolis.\n  Unfortunately, his Georgia Congressman did not have any available \nNaval Academy slots, so he was referred to a Pennsylvania congressman. \nHowever, that Congressman only had a West Point slot, so the gentlemen \nreferred him to a Congressman in Oklahoma who was able to sponsor Jack \nto attend the Naval Academy.\n  Jack's 4 years at the Naval Academy were fast and rewarding, helped \nalong by his dear friend and roommate, John Court. Jack graduated on \nJune 4, 1936, one of 242 graduates, the smallest graduating class since \n1900.\n  During his career as a naval officer, Jack held various assignments \nboth at sea and ashore. He served in World War II with the 5th Fleet \nand married his wife, Elizabeth Gordon Ellyson, on October 25, 1944, in \nSan Francisco. ``Gordie,'' the name his wife goes by, was the daughter \nof the reputed naval aviator, Theodore Gordon ``Spuds'' Ellyson.\n  Jack retired from the Navy in July of 1966 after 30 years of \ndistinguished service. He moved Gordie and his family from Key West, \nFL, to St. Simon's Island, back to the nostalgic cottage of his youth \nwithin close proximity to the wonderful lighthouse. Jack and Gordie \nhave enjoyed a full life and traveled much since then, but their center \nis St. Simon's Island and the quaint cottage they affectionately call \n``Homeport.''\n  Mr. President, it is indeed an honor and a pleasure to recognize this \naccomplished fellow Georgian from the ``greatest generation,'' some 70 \nyears after his graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy. He is the \nconsummate patriot and citizen, and his distinguished and noteworthy \nservice to our Nation is laudable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11491-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ALLAN ROSENFIELD GLOBAL HEALTH FELLOWSHIP\n\n Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today I honor Dr. Allan \nRosenfield, Dean of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia \nUniversity, as well as introduce the training program named in his \nhonor.\n  Dr. Rosenfield has spent his career working to improve the health and \nwell-being of our most vulnerable populations. He has been a champion \nof women's health both in United States and around the world and is \nwell known for his work on the HIV/AIDS pandemic, innovative family \nplanning studies, and strategies to address the tragedy of wholly \npreventable maternal deaths in resource-poor countries. As dean and \nprofessor of the Mailman School of Public Health, Dr. Rosenfield has \nbeen, for the past 20 years, a mentor for several generations of \neducators, public health students, and researchers.\n  Dr. Rosenfield was among the earliest to voice the ethical challenges \nof decreasing transmission of HIV to newborns by treating mothers with \nantiretroviral drugs before delivery, without consideration of ongoing \ncare and treatment of mothers. He has spearheaded programs in resource-\npoor settings that not only prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV \nbut also provide comprehensive clinical services to women.\n  In light of Dr. Rosenfield's countless contributions toward improving \nthe health of individuals globally--as a researcher, an advocate, an \neducator and as a compassionate human being--it is fitting to name the \nASPH-CDC Global Health Fellowship Program in honor of Allan Rosenfield.\n  The fellows in this program, who are graduates of the Nation's \naccredited schools of public health, are trained to help prevent HIV \ninfection, improve care and support, and build capacity to address the \nglobal HIV/AIDS pandemic. Fellows also participate in immunization \nprogram activities in support of global polio eradication, measles \nmortality reduction, regional measles elimination, and general global \nimmunization activities. They receive mentoring and support from \ndedicated CDC employees in the field. The mission of this fellowship \nprogram is to train the next generation of global health leaders, and \nit is fitting that this program honor an individual who is a foremost \nleader in global health.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the \nAllan Rosenfield Global Health Fellowship, most appropriately named \nafter a person whom I, and many others, admire and respect for his \nrelentless dedication and remarkable achievements in preventing disease \nand saving lives worldwide. I would like to honor and thank him for his \nmany years of work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11491-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11491-S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WOODBURY SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL, WOODBURY, MINNESOTA\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I wish honor Woodbury Senior \nHigh School, in Woodbury, MN, which will soon receive an Award for \nExcellence in Education for its exceptional and innovative achievements \nin educating children.\n  Woodbury Senior High School is truly a model of educational success. \nThis large, suburban high school has consistently ranked above the \nnational and State averages in ACT test scores and Minnesota \nComprehensive Assessment scores and has been designated as a five-star \nschool in reading and math by the Minnesota Department of Education for \n2 years in a row. Schools receiving the five-star status are few and \nfar between: Last year, 11 schools in the Twin Cities metropolitan area \nqualified for this status; this year, only 8 metro-area schools \nqualified. These scores show that top students continue to grow \nacademically and also that all students continue to perform well above \nexpectations.\n  Success at Woodbury High does not occur without the hard work and \ndedication of all students and staff. In addition to their classroom \nresponsibilities, the teaching staff at Woodbury High are engaged in \nprofessional learning communities. Teachers meet in groups each week to \nstudy student learning and compare test scores and other objective data \nto determine areas of need. Then each group discusses best practices \nfor teaching, in order to improve all students' learning. These \nprofessional learning communities have resulted in better course \ngrades, as well as improved test scores on state and national measures \nof student proficiency.\n  Course work calls for high standards of performance at all levels. \nFor advanced learners, Woodbury High offers advanced placement classes \nin English, mathematics, science, and social studies. The staff is \nworking to develop more AP classes to meet students' needs. Each year, \nmore than 250 AP tests are given in the school, with better than 75 \npercent of these students qualifying for college credit. This rigor \ntranslates into ACT scores above the State and national averages. Last \nyear, Woodbury High students averaged a composite score of 23.5 on the \nACT test. Students requiring more academic attention may enter the \nProgram for Success in grades 10, 11, and 12 in order to earn credit \nfor on-the-job experience along with academic credits. These classes \nare kept small and are taught by teachers who take personal \nresponsibility for their students' success.\n\n[[Page S11492]]\n\n  Woodbury High is working to fulfill the District goal of giving all \nstudents an opportunity for excellence. With championship athletic \nteams and arts programs generating high-quality productions, students \nare stretched to reach their potential inside and outside the \nclassroom. The Woodbury High girls soccer team has won the State \nchampionship during 3 of the past 4 years. The adapted soccer team and \ngirls basketball team have also won State championships during the past \nseveral years. Excellence in education is the daily goal of teachers, \nadministrators, and students at Woodbury High School.\n  Much of the credit for Woodbury Senior High School's success belongs \nto its principal, Linda Plante, and the dedicated teachers. The \nstudents and staff at Woodbury Senior High School understand that, in \norder to be successful, a school must go beyond achieving academic \nsuccess; it must also provide a nurturing environment where students \ncan develop the knowledge, skills, and attitudes for success throughout \nlife. All of the faculty, staff, and students at Woodbury Senior High \nSchool should be very proud of their accomplishments.\n  I congratulate Woodbury Senior High School in Woodbury for winning \nthe Award for Excellence in Education and for its exceptional \ncontributions to education in Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11492-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING DAVID HERMANCE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

He \nwas one of the most well- respected environmentalists in America. He \nwas a pioneer--called the Father of the American Prius--who worked \ntirelessly to help explain the workings and benefits of hybrid and \nother advanced technology vehicles.\n  David was an outspoken and passionate advocate. He championed \nadvanced technology vehicles throughout his career at General Motors \nand Toyota and he earned a well-deserved reputation for being the most \nauthoritative voice in America on hybrid technology.

Mr. President, today I ask that the Senate observe \nthe recent passing of Sister Cynthia ``Cindy'' Mahoney and recognize \nher tireless service to this country. A former emergency medical \ntechnician, Sister Mahoney volunteered at Ground Zero in New York City \non September 11, 2001, blessing victims and providing medical and \nspiritual attention to survivors. In the days following, Sister Mahoney \nhelped set up a respite program for first responders at St. Paul's \nChapel across from the World Trade Center. She also became an official \nRed Cross volunteer chaplain serving as a grief counselor at the Pier \n91 Federal Emergency Management Agency center. In October 2001 Sister \nMahoney joined the Red Cross Medical Examiner's Fatality Team as a \nchaplain working out of the morgue to bless human remains excavated \nfrom Ground Zero. She served on the Fatality Team well into 2002.\n  In September 2002 Sister Mahoney moved to South Carolina to establish \na spiritual practice but was unsuccessful. By this time, Sister Mahoney \nwas experiencing symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic materials \nlike asbestos. Sadly she soon became homeless, and her physical \ncondition continued to deteriorate. Last summer she was diagnosed with \nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD. Sister Mahoney died on \nNovember 1, 2006, from complications related to her pulmonary \ncondition. I ask that the Senate join me in commemorating Sister \nMahoney for her actions at Ground Zero on September 11 and in the \nmonths that followed that fateful day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11492-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11492-S11493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE CIVIL AIR PATROL\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as a member of the Civil Air Patrol \nfor more than two decades and now commander of its Congressional \nSquadron, I am proud to speak to you today about CAP, an all-volunteer \norganization celebrating 65 years of service to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  CAP was created on Dec. 1, 1941, to assist the U.S. military. During \nWorld War II, when Nazi U-boat submarines had infested our coastal \nwaters, volunteer aviators of CAP's Coastal Patrol distinguished \nthemselves valiantly. It was a time when the U.S. military was unable \nto effectively counter these submarines. Flying small single- and twin-\nengine aircraft armed with 50 and 100-pound bombs, these brave men and \nwomen flew more than 24 million miles during 86,000 over-water \nmissions--a total of 244,600 flight hours to help win the battle \nagainst U-boats that were preying on coastal shipping.\n  Despite the risk of death, they spotted 173 subs, attacked 57, hit 10 \nand sank 2. The Coastal Patrol aircrews also called in aid for 91 ships \nin distress, saved 363 survivors of sub attacks, discovered 17 floating \nmines, and flew 5,684 special convoy missions.\n  Fifty-nine members of these courageous aircrews died, 26 were lost at \nsea, and 7 others were seriously injured. They were inspired by the \nhighest sense of patriotism, and they served with pride.\n  Today, CAP continues that tradition as one of the most unique \nvolunteer organizations in America, consisting of everyday heroes from \npilots, teachers, and youth counselors to technology experts, \ncommunicators, and more. These volunteers, most employed at a paying \njob, perform 95 percent of inland search-and-rescue missions in the \ncontinental United States.\n  Whether performing search and rescue missions or helping communities \nrecover from floods, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, or terrorist \nattacks, CAP members are there to aid their Nation. In 2005 alone, they \nsaved 73 lives.\n  Following last year's terrible gulf coast hurricanes, 1,800 CAP \nvolunteers from 17 States converged on hurricane-ravaged communities, \nserving over 50,000 volunteer hours. These patriotic members flew 1,000 \nair missions during 2,000 hours of flight time and provided more than \n2,000 time-critical images of affected areas. They also ensured the \nwell-being of Americans by visiting 4,266 homes, contacting 8,500 \nresidents, and distributing 30,000 pounds of relief supplies.\n  Coming full circle from its beginnings in World War II, Civil Air \nPatrol is again taking on homeland security responsibilities for the \nNation. These include assisting the Air Force in ensuring the skies \nabove Washington, DC, are safe and flying target-intercept training \nmissions for U.S. military pilots all at a low cost of about $100 per \nmission.\n  With 530 aircraft and thousands of trained aircrew members, CAP is a \ntremendous asset to the United States at a critical juncture in our \nhistory. This capability, however, is now greatly enhanced because CAP, \nover the past few years, had the foresight to invest in developing and \nobtaining sophisticated new technologies to help with its emergency \nmissions. Today it uses two high-technology imaging systems Airborne \nReal-time Cueing Hyperspectral Enhanced Reconnaissance, ARCHER, and \nsatellite-transmitted digital imaging systems, SDIS, to assist in \nsearch and rescue, disaster-assessment missions and other missions. \nThese technologies make it a vital asset to the Air Force, State \ngovernments and local communities.\n  CAP also provides exceptional growth opportunities to 22,550 youth in \ncadet programs, which stress leadership and moral responsibility and \nteach aviation and emergency response skills. Through CAP, these youth \ngain access to scholarship opportunities, top national summer flight \nacademies, flight training in powered and glider aircraft, and programs \nthat emphasize leadership and careers in aviation. They routinely help \ncommunities when disaster strikes and other emergencies occur by \noperating radios, helping park\n\n[[Page S11493]]\n\naircraft, and serving on ground search and survey teams.\n  In addition, CAP's Aerospace Education Program touches over 400 \neducators, over 20,000 cadets, and thousands of other youths in \nclassrooms across America by teaching them aerospace concepts that \nemphasize aviation's connection to history, math, science, government, \nand economics.\n  CAP's Missions for America annually impact the lives of thousands of \nAmericans. These 56,000 volunteers all everyday heroes are deserving of \nour highest praise.

Mr. President, today I wish recognize the fine \nwork of the Western South Dakota Senior Services Meals Program in South \nDakota.\n  This year, the Meals Program celebrates 25 years of service to \nelderly and disabled individuals in western South Dakota. The Meals \nProgram currently serves between 735 and 750 meals per day, or 185,000 \nmeals annually, to residents at 28 stations in 16 communities. These \ncommunities include Rapid City, several cities in the Black Hills, and \nmany rural communities in western South Dakota.\n  Despite declining budgets, the goal of the Meals Program has remained \nconstant: to provide healthy and nutritious meals to hundreds of Black \nHills and western South Dakota residents. Many of these individuals are \nhomebound, and the noon meal they receive is often the only warm, \nhealthy, and nutritious meal they receive during the day. The visit by \nthe Meals Program volunteer is welcomed by the elderly or disabled \nindividual who is unable to leave their home or apartment. It is an \nopportunity for a brief chat with a friend and to receive a nutritious, \nhome-cooked meal.\n  Meals are also served at various apartment complexes or senior \ncitizens centers where several tenants can come together, eat a good \nmeal, and share stories with friends and neighbors. When someone is \nunable to attend the noon meal, the meal is delivered to the apartment \nand it is an opportunity to check on the health and welfare of the \nindividual.\n  It is my hope that more individuals can receive the benefits of the \nMeals Program in my State and across the Nation. More funds are needed \nso that current programs can be maintained and expanded so that \ndeserving individuals can get the nutritious meals they need. I \nappreciate the various local sponsors and entities that allow the Meals \nProgram to function in western South Dakota.\n  I commend and applaud the great work of all the staff and volunteers \nof the Meals Program and congratulate Western South Dakota Senior \nServices, Inc., for their efforts. Thousands of western South Dakota \nresidents have benefited greatly over the past 25 years from the Meals \nProgram, and it is my hope these services can continue for many years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11493-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONTROL GROUP'S 100 ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize and \ncongratulate a great New Jersey company, the Control Group, on \ncompleting 100 years of service to firms and facilities throughout the \ncountry. This century-old company founded in 1906 by Austrian immigrant \nLouis Turen is the Nation's oldest, privately owned facility \nmaintenance service company. The Control Group is still a family-owned \nand operated business and one of the largest private employers in the \nState of New Jersey. Four generations of the Turen family have directed \nControl Group from their headquarters in Secaucus, NJ.\n  Louis Turen began a one-man enterprise washing windows and provided \nmaintenance services. He eventually passed the torch on to sons Nathan \nand Sam Turen, who continued the tradition. Today, Nathan's sons Edward \nD. Turen and Neal L. Turen carry the mantle of leadership of the \norganization. A fourth generation, Scott Turen continues to carry on \nthe family tradition. The growth of the company has been consistent and \nhas expanded internationally as well as across our country achieving \nrevenues in excess of $300 million annually.\n  Control's success has produced a well-trained, loyal workforce of \nmore than 7,000 employees providing their services to real estate, \nretail, banking, airport, pharmaceutical, and manufacturing industries \nas well as educational and public institutions. As a tribute to \nControl's high-quality service capabilities, its long-term customer \nbase continues to grow, including some 50-year client relationships. \nControl Group has contributed to New Jersey's economy, its business \nclimate and its jobs market.\n  Faithful to its traditions of reliable service, quality, and new \nproducts, the Control Group has earned a reputation for its integrity, \nvision, and dedication. It is believed that the company will continue \nto expand its service offerings which will continue to expand its \ngrowth and opportunity. We applaud and thank the Turen family and their \nfine companies for their commitment to quality and client satisfaction \nand its allegiance to its roots in the State of New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11493-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11493]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LYNTON CALDWELL\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I honor the life and work of a \nfellow Hoosier, Dr. Lynton Keith Caldwell, of Bloomigton, IN. I ask \nthat the following tribute, attributed to Wendy Read Wertz of \nBloomington, Indiana, be printed in the Record.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n       Dr. Lynton Keith Caldwell, 92, regarded as one of the \n     twentieth century's most distinguished scholars in the fields \n     of environmental policy, law, science and administration, and \n     a principal architect of the National Environmental Policy \n     Act of 1969, died on August 15, 2006, at his home in \n     Bloomington, Indiana. At the time of his death Dr. Caldwell \n     was Arthur F. Bentley Professor Emeritus of Political Science \n     and Professor of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana \n     University.\n       Today, Dr. Caldwell is frequently referred to as the \n     ``father of NEPA'' and the ``inventor'' of the Environmental \n     Impact Statement. Importantly, as he frequently reminded \n     people later, NEPA did much more than simply mandate \n     paperwork. True to its title, Congress established this \n     nation's environmental policies in Section 101(a) of the Act, \n     declaring that, ``it is the continuing policy of the Federal \n     Government, in cooperation with State and local governments, \n     and other concerned public and private organizations, to use \n     all practicable means and measures, including financial and \n     technical assistance, in a manner calculated to foster and \n     promote the general welfare, to create and maintain \n     conditions under which man and nature can exist in productive \n     harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other \n     requirements of present and future generations of \n     Americans.'' And the reach of those policies goes beyond the \n     federal government to touch every American. Indeed, in the \n     law, ``The Congress recognizes that each person should enjoy \n     a healthful environment and that each person has a \n     responsibility to contribute to the preservation and \n     enhancement of the environment'' (Section 101(c)).\n       Dr. Caldwell lived a full life, making contributions on \n     many levels. He earned his undergraduate degree in English at \n     the University of Chicago in 1934, his Masters degree at \n     Harvard in History and Government in 1938, and his doctorate \n     degree in Political Science at the University of Chicago in \n     1943 where his special focus was on public administration. In \n     1977 he was awarded an honorary LLD from Western Michigan \n     University.\n       From 1944 until 1962 Dr. Caldwell's career was focused on \n     public administration. U.N. appointments took him to \n     Columbia, the Philippines and Turkey where he served in \n     Ankara as the U.N. Co-Director of the Public Administration \n     Institute for Turkey and the Middle East. He became a \n     Professor of Government at Indiana University in 1956 where \n     he served as Director of the Institute of Training for Public \n     Service and Coordinator of the Indonesian and Thailand Public \n     Administration programs. Further assignments in a consulting \n     or lecturing capacity took him to Japan, Pakistan, India, \n     Europe and Australia.\n       In his private capacity, however, Dr. Caldwell was deeply \n     committed to conservation issues. A lover of nature from \n     childhood, he became a knowledgeable botanist and bird \n     watcher. He helped to found the South Bend branch of the \n     Audubon Society, assisted in the establishment of the Indiana \n     Dunes National Lakeshore, and was a founding member of both \n     the first local chapter of The Nature Conservancy in New York \n     and of the Indiana chapter. He served on the Board of \n     Governors of the Nature Conservancy from 1959-1965.\n       Dr. Caldwell will undoubtedly be missed by the many, many \n     former students, colleagues and professionals in this country \n     and around the world who benefited from his insights and \n     teachings. His dignity, knowledge and personal compassion for \n     the people and world around him served this nation \n     well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11493-4", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11493-S11494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING SALVATORE FERRO\n\n Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, today I honor Salvatore Ferro's 40 \nyears of\n\n[[Page S11494]]\n\ndedicated service at the Defense Intelligence Agency, DIA. ``Sal,'' who \nhas worked for all 16 Directors of the DIA, will be retiring on January \n3, 2007. He will be sorely missed by the Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Sal has had a long and distinguished Government career. Sal served \nwith honor in the Army in the Vietnam War, working as an intelligence \nofficer with the ``Phoenix'' program. After his discharge from the Army \nin 1969, Sal joined DIA, just 8 years after its establishment as an \nagency and went right back to Vietnam for a 1-year tour as a civilian \nintelligence officer.\n  After finishing his service in Vietnam, Sal returned to the United \nStates to work in DIA's Arlington Hall Station facility in northern \nVirginia. During the next decade, Mr. Ferro drew on his wartime \nexperience and his analytical talents to work on issues related to \nAmerican servicemen taken as prisoners of war or declared missing in \naction in Southeast Asia.\n  In 1991, Sal moved over to DIA's Office for Congressional Affairs in \nthe Pentagon. This is when our committee really came to know Sal. He \nhas been an invaluable asset to the members and staff of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence. He has been tenacious in getting \nanswers to our many questions and requests for information. He has \ntaken pride in being responsive and making sure that DIA consistently \nmet our deadlines. More important, his professionalism, diplomatic \nskills, and amazingly positive personality have smoothed over countless \nripples in DIA's relations with Congress. Ask any Intelligence \nCommittee staffer who has dealt with Sal over the years, an they will \ntell you that he is not only a pleasure to work with, he is also a good \nfriend. You can always count on Sal for a kind word and a ``happy \nFriday.''\n  Sal has supported the Intelligence Committee's oversight work on \ncountless topics. Some of the most significant and time-consuming \ninclude the 9/11 Joint Inquiry, the review of the intelligence \ncommunity's prewar intelligence assessments on Iraq, and the Able \nDanger review. I will always be most grateful to Sal for his tireless \nsupport over the years in my efforts to resolve the status of Navy \npilot CAPT Scott Speicher, who has been missing since the first gulf \nwar.\n  Mr. Sal Ferro is a true national intelligence asset, and he has been \none of the Defense Intelligence Agency's secret weapons. He will be \nmissed.\n  Thank you for your service, Sal, and don't be a stranger.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11494-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. NORMAN DUFFY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I join the Council for \nAdvancement and Support of Education, CASE, and the Carnegie Foundation \nin honoring Dr. Norman Duffy. Dr. Duffy, a chemistry professor at \nWheeling Jesuit University, has personified both the best in education \nand the best in West Virginia throughout his career.\n  After receiving his bachelor of science in chemistry from Georgetown \nUniversity, where he continued his studies as a doctoral student, Dr. \nDuffy began his career as a graduate and research assistant. His \nresearch then took him overseas where he became a NATO postdoctoral \nfellow at University College in London. After receiving his Ph.D. he \nbegan his teaching career at Kent State University where he first \nbecame a full professor and then eventually chairman of the Department \nof Chemistry.\n  Upon his departure from Kent State University in 1996, Dr. Duffy \njoined the faculty of Wheeling Jesuit University, WJU. From 1996 to \n2000 he was chairman of the Department of Biology and Chemistry and \nfrom 2000 to 2002 he was Chairman of the Department of Chemistry. He \ncontinues teaching small classes that allow him to focus on \nindividualized education as a professor in the Department of Chemistry.\n  In addition to his illustrious teaching career, Dr. Duffy has done a \ngreat deal to further the general public's knowledge of chemistry and \nhas been acknowledged for doing so. He has released 95 publications, \nauthored 14 research grants at WJU, including three from the National \nScience Foundation, and has received many honors and awards including \nthe Exemplary Teacher award from the American Association of Higher \nEducation during their 25th anniversary celebration in 1994.\n  In my decades of service to the people of West Virginia in the \nSenate, I have become very familiar with Wheeling Jesuit University and \nits outstanding academic programs. For 10 consecutive years US News and \nWorld Report has ranked WJU as among the best master's universities in \nthe South.\n  Wheeling Jesuit has become one of the leading universities in the \ncountry in helping to educate and prepare students for the dynamic \neconomy of the 21st century. WJU is home to the brand new $10 million \nAcker Science Center, the Robert C. Byrd National Technology Transfer \nCenter, the Erma Ora Byrd Center for Educational Technologies, and \nNASA's flagship educational program, The Classroom of the Future, which \nuses simulated space missions as a way to teach elementary and high \nschool students about science and math.\n  The true legacy of a teacher is the mark that their students leave on \nthe world, and by that measurement Dr. Duffy has certainly had a \nremarkable career. He has taught future Fulbright Scholars, many \nstudents who have received departmental honors, and, of course, \nstudents who have been inspired enough by his example to become \nteachers themselves.\n  As a teacher, Dr. Duffy admits his work is never finished. Whenever \nhe is asked if he plans to retire, Dr. Duffy responds by asking, ``Does \neveryone in West Virginia understand chemistry?'' Dr. Duffy's \ndedication is obvious and inspiring.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11494-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11494-S11495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JOHN ``BUCK'' O'NEIL EULOGY\n\n Mr. TALENT. Mr. President, today I wish to pay my respects and \nto say goodbye to a man who was bigger than life itself. John Jordan \n``Buck'' O'Neil passed away on Friday, October 6, in Kansas City at the \nage of 94. Buck was a gifted baseball player, a veteran of the U.S. \nNavy, a devoted community leader, a role model for young and old and a \ngood friend he was and will always be an American Hero.\n  I count myself as truly fortunate to have known Buck and will always \ncherish the opportunities I had to visit with him. When I think of \nBuck, I think of a great and loving man with a heart as big as Kansas \nCity who believed that love and education could heal all wounds. I \nthink of his near mythical baseball career, a career that spanned seven \ndecades, making him a foremost authority of the game and one of its \ngreatest ambassadors. I think of his contributions to his community as \na role model and to society as a leader in the civil rights movement. \nBuck's contributions to the game of baseball and society will be \neverlasting.\n  I'd like to take a few minutes to tell you a little bit about Buck's \nlife.\n  Buck O'Neil, the player, was a first baseman and manager for the \nKansas City Monarchs from 1937 through 1955. His achievements include \nhitting .353 and leading his team to the 1942 Negro World Series Title. \nHis career batting average of .288, included four .300-plus seasons \nwinning batting titles in 1940 and 1946, hitting .345 and.353 \nrespectively. Buck played in the 1942, 1943 and 1949 East-West All-Star \nClassics and barnstormed with the Satchel Paige All-Stars during the \n1930s and 1940s.\n  Buck O'Neil, the manager, led the Monarchs from 1948 through 1955. \nHis achievements as a manager include sending more Negro League players \nto the Major Leagues than any other manager in baseball history, \nincluding Ernie Banks, Elston Howard, Connie Johnson, Sweet Lou \nJohnson, and Satchel Paige. He led the Monarchs to league titles in \n1948, 1950, 1951 and 1953 and he managed the West squad in the East-\nWest All-Star game in 1950, 1952, 1954 and 1955--the West won all four \ncontests.\n  In 1956, Buck was hired by the Chicago Cubs as a scout paving the way \nfor him to make history 6 years later when he became the first African \nAmerican to coach in the Major Leagues. As a scout he discovered such \nsuperstars as Lou Brock and Joe Carter. In 1988, after more than 30 \nyears with the Cubs, he returned home to Kansas City to scout for the \nKansas City Royals.\n  The work Buck did after his retirement from the game are arguably \nmore significant to the history of baseball than his exploits on the \nfield as a player, scout and manager. Buck's true passion over the past \n16 years was to share with the world the contributions that\n\n[[Page S11495]]\n\nNegro Leagues players made to our National Pastime and more importantly \nto society through his work as chairman of America's National Negro \nLeagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City.\n  Buck's tireless work led the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, \nNY, to hold a special election this spring to induct Negro Leagues and \npre-Negro Leagues candidates into the Hall. In July, 17 legendary \nplayers, managers and owners were inducted into the Hall. This \ninduction was bittersweet for many of us as its most visible legend, \nBuck O'Neil, did not receive the necessary votes. Although many of us \nviewed this as an outrageous oversight, Buck graciously viewed this as \none of the greatest days in Negro Leagues history. That was Buck in his \ntruest form. He was always about doing the right thing. No matter what \ndoors had been closed to him; he always picked himself up and did what \nwas right, never what was easiest or most beneficial to himself. What \nwas most important to Buck was his true love for the Negro Leagues, the \nNegro Leagues players and the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum--he poured \nall of his life and energy into seeing that their stories were told and \nnever forgotten.\n  Buck reminded us that these Leagues and their players are significant \non so many levels: they represent a triumph of the human spirit, \ntremendous sportsmanship, high quality of play, were of vital \nimportance to the African American community, and they led directly to \nthe integration of the Major Leagues, which was the first in a series \nof major civil rights landmarks that eventually led to the progress we \nhave achieved today. Buck was significant in so many ways and on so \nmany different levels in his own right--he played an important part in \nshaping the America we live in today.\n  Buck's remarkable life reminds me of a favorite poem, Game Called, by \nGrantland Rice. I'd like to read it into the Record:\n\n     Game Called. Across the field of play\n     the dusk has come, the hour is late.\n     The fight is done and lost or won,\n     the player files out through the gate.\n     The tumult dies, the cheer is hushed,\n     the stands are bare, the park is still\n     But through the night there shines the light,\n     home beyond the silent hill\n\n     Game Called. Where in the golden light\n     the bugle rolled the reveille.\n     The shadows creep where night falls deep,\n     and taps has called the end of play.\n     The game is done, the score is in,\n     the final cheer and jeer have passed.\n     But in the night, beyond the fight,\n     the player finds his rest at last.\n\n     Game Called. Upon the field of life\n     the darkness gathers far and wide,\n     the dream is done, the score is spun\n     that stands forever in the guide.\n     Nor victory, nor yet defeat\n     is chalked against the players name.\n     But down the roll, the final scroll,\n     shows only how he played the game.\n\n  There is little question that Buck played the game with all his heart \nand lived his life to the fullest. Buck, you will be missed but not \nforgotten. Our Nation is better by virtue of your play on the field and \nservice off the field. The principle by which you lived your life will \ncarry on through all who knew you. The freedom for which you fought \nendures. May God bless you with a splendid room within His house. He \nhas certainly blessed me with the privilege of having known \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11495-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11495-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11495-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:07 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1458.

A resolution adopted by the Michigan House of \n     Representatives relative to extending the production tax \n     credit for wind power energy development; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 307\n\n       Whereas, Energy is our economic lifeblood. Indeed, with \n     energy prices soaring to new and never seen heights in our \n     country this is more apparent now than ever. In an effort to \n     foster the development of alternative energy sources for the \n     future, a production tax credit for wind power energy \n     development was established in 1992. The success of this \n     program is evident in the significant progress that has been \n     made in the development of clean sources of power for our \n     country in the years since that time; and\n       Whereas, The long-term effectiveness of the production tax \n     credit for wind energy development has been impeded by the \n     fact that this important program faces sunset provisions \n     every two years. Although the sunset is a productive \n     oversight tool to ensure sound spending policies, an extended \n     effort like developing viable wind energy technologies \n     requires enormous capital expenses and long-term commitment. \n     The requirement for renewal every two years has proven to be \n     counterproductive, as demonstrated by the fact that during \n     most two-year cycles, the amount of power added by wind \n     energy investment drops considerably in the second year as \n     developers worry if the tax credit will be renewed after its \n     sunset expiration; and\n       Whereas, The production tax credit would be far more \n     effective if it could be extended farther beyond a two-year \n     period. Like most other tax credits the government creates to \n     encourage beneficial behaviors, the production tax credit is \n     designed to foster an emerging and capital-intensive industry \n     that may one day be a key part of America's overall energy \n     needs. Clearly, wind energy technology will see many more \n     significant advances with a consistent, multiple-year tax \n     approach; now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S11498]]\n\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to extend the production tax credit for wind \n     power energy development beyond the two-year cycle under \n     which it now operates: and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this document be presented to the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-445. A resolution adopted by the Pennsylvania House of \n     Representatives relative to securing international \n     recognition and rights for the Ecumenical Patriarchate; to \n     the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 876\n\n       Whereas, The Ecumenical Patriarchate, located in Istanbul, \n     Turkey, is the sacred See that presides in a spirit of \n     brotherhood over a communion of the self-governing churches \n     of the Orthodox Christian world; and\n       Whereas, The See is led by Ecumenical Patriarch \n     Bartholomew, who is the 269th in direct succession to the \n     Apostle Andrew and holds titular primacy as primus inter \n     pares, meaning ``first among equals'' in the community of \n     Orthodox churches worldwide; and\n       Whereas, In 1994 Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, along \n     with leaders of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, \n     cosponsored the Conference on Peace and Tolerance, which \n     brought together Christian, Jewish and Muslim religious \n     leaders for an interfaith dialogue to help end the Balkan \n     conflict and the ethnic conflict in the Caucasus region; and\n       Whereas, In 1997 the Congress of the United States awarded \n     Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew with the Congressional Gold \n     Medal; and\n       Whereas, Following the terrorist attacks on our nation on \n     September 11, 2001, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew gathered \n     a group of international religious leaders to produce the \n     first joint statement with Muslim leaders that condemned the \n     9/11 attacks as ``anti-religious''; and\n       Whereas, In October 2005 the Ecumenical Patriarch, along \n     with Christian, Jewish and Muslim leaders, cosponsored the \n     Conference on Peace and Tolerance to further promote peace \n     and stability in southeastern Europe, the Caucasus region and \n     Central Asia via religious leaders' interfaith dialogue, \n     understanding and action; and\n       Whereas, The Orthodox Christian Church, in existence for \n     nearly 2,000 years, numbers approximately 300 million members \n     worldwide with more than 2 million members in the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas, Since 1453 the continuing presence of the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate in Turkey has been a living testament \n     to the religious coexistence of Christians and Muslims; and\n       Whereas, This religious coexistence is in jeopardy because \n     the Government of Turkey refuses to recognize the rights and \n     religious freedoms of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which is \n     considered a minority religion by the Turkish government; and\n       Whereas, The Government of Turkey has limited the \n     candidates available to hold the office of Ecumenical \n     Patriarch to only Turkish nationals, and from the millions of \n     Orthodox Christians living in Turkey at the turn of the \n     20th century, and due to the continued policies of \n     minority discrimination during this period by the Turkish \n     government, there remain less than 3,000 of the Ecumenical \n     Patriarch's flock left in Turkey today; and\n       Whereas, The Government of Turkey has reneged on its \n     agreement to reopen the Theological School on the island of \n     Halki, which the Turkish government closed in 1971, thus \n     impeding training for Orthodox Christian clergy; and\n       Whereas, The Turkish government has confiscated nearly 94% \n     of the properties of the Ecumenical Patriarchate and has \n     placed a 42% tax retroactive to 1999 on the Baloukli Hospital \n     and Home for the Aged, a charity hospital run by the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate; and\n       Whereas, The European Union, a group of nations with a \n     common goal of promoting peace and the well-being of its \n     peoples, began accession negotiations with Turkey on October \n     3, 2005; and\n       Whereas, The European Union defined membership criteria for \n     accession at the Copenhagen European Council in 1993, \n     obligating candidate countries to achieve certain levels of \n     reform, including stability of institutions guaranteeing \n     democracy, adherence to the rule of law and respect for and \n     protection of minorities and human rights; and\n       Whereas, The Turkish government's current treatment of the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate is inconsistent with the membership \n     conditions and goals of the European Union; and\n       Whereas, Orthodox Christians in this Commonwealth and \n     throughout the United States stand to lose their spiritual \n     leader because of the continued actions of the Turkish \n     government; and\n       Whereas, In November 2006 the Archons of the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate of the Order of St. Andrew the Apostle, a group \n     of laymen who each have been honored with a Patriarchal \n     title, or ``offikion,'' by the Ecumenical Patriarch for their \n     outstanding service to the Orthodox Church, will send an \n     American delegation to Turkey to meet with Turkish government \n     officials, as well as the United States Ambassador to the \n     Republic of Turkey, regarding the Turkish government's \n     treatment of the Ecumenical Patriarchate; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania urge the Government of Turkey to \n     do all of the following:\n       (1) Uphold and safeguard religious and human rights without \n     compromise.\n       (2) Cease its discrimination of the Ecumenical \n     Patriarchate.\n       (3) Grant the Ecumenical Patriarch appropriate \n     international recognition, ecclesiastic succession and the \n     right to train clergy of all nationalities.\n       (4) Respect the property rights and human rights of the \n     Ecumenical Patriarchate; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, to the United States \n     Ambassador to the Republic of Turkey, to the Ambassador of \n     the Republic of Turkey to the United States and to the \n     Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-446. A resolution adopted by the Michigan Senate \n     relative to increasing funding to fully implement the Vaccine \n     for Children Program; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 162\n\n       Whereas, The Vaccine for Children program is an outstanding \n     example of a successful public-private partnership between \n     the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     and healthcare providers. Vaccines purchased with the buying \n     power of the federal government are distributed, at no cost \n     to the patient or provider, to all participating providers \n     caring for uninsured and underinsured children, Medicaid \n     recipients, and Native Americans and Alaskan Natives. By \n     distributing three-fourths of all the publicly funded doses, \n     the Vaccine for Children program gives eligible children \n     access to newly recommended vaccines and strengthens immunity \n     levels across the community. Further, the program delivers \n     vaccines to children as part of their routine, primary care \n     rather than diverting them to public health departments; and\n       Whereas, A list of vaccines to be administered through the \n     Vaccine for Children program is developed through sound, \n     scientific review. The Advisory Committee on Immunization \n     Practices is authorized in statute to establish the list of \n     vaccines to be administered through the program. Fifteen \n     experts in infectious disease and immunization who sit on the \n     committee meet publicly three times a year to consider \n     revising the list through the addition of new vaccines or \n     revising existing vaccine resolutions. The list then provides \n     the basis for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     to negotiate contacts for the purchase of large quantities of \n     childhood vaccines; and\n       Whereas, The Vaccine for Children program adheres to the \n     Vaccine Management Business Improvement Project, which \n     leverages commercial best practices in vaccine procurement, \n     ordering, distribution, and supply management. The program \n     saves money for states through bulk purchases and eliminates \n     variations in price from state to state. By managing public \n     resources so astutely, the program has achieved the ultimate \n     goal of eliminating cost as a barrier to vaccinating eligible \n     children; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize Congress to \n     increase funding to fully implement the Vaccine for Children \n     program; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11498-1", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive report of a nomination was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. GRASSLEY for the Committee on Finance.\n       *Eric Solomon, of New Jersey, to be an Assistant Secretary \n     of the Treasury.\n\n  *Nomination was reported with recommendation that it be confirmed \nsubject to the nominee's commitment to respond to requests to appear \nand testify before any duly constituted committee of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11498-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11498-S11499]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. LEVIN:\n       S. 4099.

A bill to expand visa waiver program to countries on a \nprobationary basis and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Secure Travel \nand Counterterrorism Partnership Act of 2006, along with my good \nfriends Senators Akaka, Lugar, Mikulski, and Santorum.\n  This legislation would expand the U.S. Visa Waiver Program in a way \nthat would increase cooperation with key allies in the war on terror \nwhile strengthening U.S. national security.\n  The bill provides a way for us to expand and improve the visa waiver \nsystem so that Americans are safer and our Nation is more prosperous \nfor years to come.\n  This legislation comes at a particularly important time in our \nNation's history. We are currently facing multiple foreign policy \nchallenges in the post-9/11 world. We need the cooperation of several \nallies to combat transnational threats. As such, we are asking our \nfriends and allies to contribute more of their troops and resources to \nIraq, Afghanistan, and other conflicts in the world, so that we can be \nsuccessful. This legislation will help us to solidify these \nrelationships and increase goodwill toward the U.S. for years to come, \nwhile also enhancing travel security and safety at home.\n  My legislation would authorize the Department of Homeland Security, \nin consultation with the Department of State, to expand the Visa Waiver \nProgram to countries that are true friends of America and prepared to \ndo more to help us keep terrorists and criminals out of our borders.\n  For those that do not know about the Visa Waiver Program, it was \nestablished in 1986 to improve relations with U.S. allies and \nstrengthen the U.S. economy. The program permitted nationals from the \nselected countries to enter the United States without a visa for up to \n90 days for tourism or business.\n  Currently, 27 countries participate in the program, including the \nUnited Kingdom. But there are a number of new allies who would also \nlike to participate in the Visa Waiver Program and are willing to meet \nstrict security requirements and cooperate on counterterrorism \ninitiatives.\n  Many of these countries were former members of the Soviet Union. They \nwere victims of Soviet oppression for years, against their will, and \ndespite their desire for freedom.\n  Today, many of these countries have boots on the ground in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and want to help us stop the terrorists and promote \ndemocracy. These countries are naturally suited to help other countries \nas they fight for freedom and democracy. Many of these countries are \nalso actively engaged in Cuba, helping to promote democracy there. \nLikewise, they have a unique understanding of the struggle for \ndemocracy that is taking place in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Despite their commitments to the principles of freedom and democracy, \nthese countries are still paying a price that other countries in the \nWest do not pay. Citizens of Portugal, the U.K., or Spain can travel \neasily to the U.S., while citizens of Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia are \ngiven second-class treatment.\n  I would like to share a few examples to put a human face on this \nproblem.\n  I recently learned of a story involving a young Czech officer who \nserved in Iraq with Americans. This soldier wanted to come to America \nto visit the American friends he made during combat operations. But his \napplication for a visa was refused. Why? Because his passport included \na visit to Iraq, the very place he served with American soldiers.\n  Another example involves young students from places like Latvia, \nEstonia, or Bulgaria. These young people have a positive view of \nAmerica and hope to visit our country. However, their expensive visa \napplications are frequently rejected, dampening their spirits and \ntainting their image of America. And this view is spreading every day.\n  By limiting travel to the U.S., we are risking a loss of influence \nwith the future leaders of our closest allies.\n  I have been working for the last several months to develop a piece of \nlegislation that will address these challenges, without sacrificing \nU.S. security. I was pleased when I heard President Bush announce his \nintention to focus on this issue in the coming year. On the margins of \nthe NATO Summit in Riga, he called on Congress to expand the Visa \nWaiver Program so that we can reward our closest allies for their help \nand friendship.\n  I agree with the President--but I want to clarify that this is not \nsimply a reward for these countries. The true reward is the knowledge \nthat we are free and democratic countries working together to advance \ninternational security. But the foremost goal of this legislation is to \ncreate mutually beneficial partnerships with clear national security \nadvantages for the United States.\n  By continuing on the current path, we risk marginalizing some of our \nclosest allies in the war on terror and losing the hearts and minds of \ntheir future leaders and citizens. We have an opportunity to change \ndirection in a way that will promote our own national security \ninterests and improve control of our borders. The Secure Travel and \nCounterterrorism Partnership Act can achieve all of these objectives.\n  What would this bill do?\n  The legislation would expand visa-free travel privileges for up to \nfive new countries, for a probationary period of 3 years.\n  In order for a country to participate in the plan, the executive \nbranch would first need to certify that the country is cooperative on \ncounterterrorism and does not pose a security or law enforcement threat \nto the United States. However, the country would also be required to \ntake a number of new steps to enhance our common security.\n  Prior to participation, the countries would be required to conclude \nnew agreements with the United States to further strengthen cooperation \non counterterrorism and improve information-sharing about critical \nsecurity issues.\n  Some might say--if these countries are key allies, aren't they \ncooperating with us already? The answer is yes. They are very \ncooperative. But in today's heightened security environment, there is \nmore that each country can do, such as sharing additional sensitive \ninformation that can help our intelligence community and law \nenforcement agencies investigate threats and combat terrorist activity. \nBy negotiating new agreements on counterterrorism and information-\nsharing to permit participation in the Visa Waiver Program, we can \nreduce threats to the United States.\n\n  Additionally, the legislation would require the countries to enact a \nnumber of significant security measures, which would limit illegal \nentry and unlawful presence in their countries and impede travel by \nterrorists and transnational criminals. Security standards required for \nparticipation in the program would include electronic passports with \nbiometric information, as well as prompt reporting of lost, stolen, or \nfraudulent travel documents to the U.S. and Interpol.\n  These new requirements would help make the U.S. more secure. \nExpanding the number of participating countries would increase the \nnumber of states meeting common security standards. This would allow \nthe United States to shift consular resources used to issue visas to \nother missions with more critical security needs.\n  If at any time, participant countries are not complying with these \nrequirements, their probationary status in the program could be \nrevoked. Likewise, if the program is determined to be successful, it \ncould be expanded to include additional countries.\n  The last part of the legislation is aimed at enhancing security \nrequirements for countries who are currently participating in the Visa \nWaiver Program. In this post 9/11 world, the U.S. Government has \nalready required additional security measures of participating visa \nwaiver countries, such as machine-readable passports with biometric \ninformation. But we can and must do more.\n  I was very pleased that last week, Homeland Security Secretary \nChertoff recommended several new measures to further enhance the \nefficiency and security of the Visa Waiver Program. His\n\n[[Page S11501]]\n\nrecommendations included an electronic travel authorization system, \nadditional passenger information exchanges, common standards for \nairport security and baggage screening, cooperation in the air marshal \nprogram, and home country assistance in repatriation for any traveler \nwho overstays the terms of their visa or violates U.S. law.\n  As the administration works to develop the details of these \nrecommendations, my legislation would require that within one year, the \nexecutive branch provide a report to Congress on its plans for the Visa \nWaiver Program improvements.\n  In addition to the benefits to foreign relations and homeland \nsecurity, this bill would do a great deal to advance U.S. \ncompetitiveness. Visa-free travel to the United States has been proven \nto significantly boost tourism and business, as well as airline \nrevenues, and would generate substantial economic benefits to the \nUnited States well into the future. Additionally, it would improve \nattitudes toward the United States throughout the world, which would \nbenefit the U.S. economy and national security for generations to come.\n  As a member of both the Foreign Relations and the Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs Committees, I believe that we have a real \nopportunity to improve our foreign relations, our homeland defense, and \nthe visa waiver system overall.\n  Therefore, I call on my colleagues in the Senate and the House to \nexamine this legislation with a serious eye, refraining from the knee-\njerk reaction that an expanded program is bad for national security. \nWhen you look at the facts involved and the opportunities ahead, you \ncan see that we have a chance to improve security cooperation and \nstrengthen the bonds of friendship with our allies in the war on \nterror.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Congress and the \nPresident to move this legislation forward.\n  As the administration works to develop the details of these \nrecommendations, my legislation would require that within one year, the \nexecutive branch provide a report to Congress on its plans for Visa \nWaiver Program improvements.\n  In addition to the benefits to foreign relations and homeland \nsecurity, this bill would do a great deal to advance U.S. \ncompetitiveness.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nthe use of telecommunications devices for the purposes of preventing or \nobstructing the broadcast or exchange of election-related information; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, this year we witnessed a historic election, \nwhere the American people said loud and clear that the Nation is going \nin the wrong direction and things must change. One important part of \nthat change is cleaning up our electoral process.\n  Dirty tricks are not a new thing in American politics. I am from \nChicago, and my hometown has seen its share of political tricks. But \nsome of tricks we have seen in recent elections astounded even those of \nus who thought we had seen everything.\n  For example, in 2002, the executive director of the New Hampshire \nRepublican State Committee saw flyers advertising telephone numbers for \nDemocratic get-out-the-vote efforts that offered voters rides to the \npolls. The executive director then hatched the idea of jamming those \nphone lines on election day to prevent voters from getting rides to the \npolls.\n  He consulted the New England Regional Political Director for the \nRepublican National Committee, who led him to an associate who could \nhandle phone jamming efforts, an outfit called GOP Marketplace. GOP \nMarketplace contacted an Idaho-based tele-services company that agreed \nto have employees place hang-up calls to the Manchester Democratic \nParty and the Manchester Professional Firefighters Association--the two \ngroups offering rides--on election day, November 5, 2002.\n  As a result of these efforts, the New Hampshire Democratic Party's \nget-out-the-vote volunteers and employees answered the phones only to \nfind callers who said nothing and immediately hung up. Legitimate \nvoters who called the Manchester Democratic Party or the Manchester \nProfessional Firefighters Association seeking a ride to the polls \nreceived busy signals.\n  The Department of Justice prosecuted many of those responsible for \nthis dirty campaign, and some of the guilty have already served their \nsentences. These men were tried under existing phone harassment and \ncivil rights laws. However, it is likely that the perpetrators of the \nnext phone jamming effort will not be so ham-handed. General harassment \nlaws may be insufficient to get at the next conspiracy. And even in the \nmost recent election, we continue to hear about instances in which \nphone lines are misused.\n  That is why I am introducing the Election Jamming Prevention Act \ntoday. This bill will ensure that those who seek to disable election-\nrelated telephone communications will be criminally liable. This does \nnot impede political speech--but this does stop nefarious efforts to \nshut down phone lines to cripple election-related efforts. From get-\nout-the-vote efforts, to voter education campaigns, qualified voters \ndeserve to have access to information that will assist them in the \nexercise of their right to vote. Someone's ability to hire a company to \nplace hang-up calls should not determine whether voters get the \ninformation they need to go to the polls on election day.\n  This shouldn't be a partisan issue, so I hope my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle will join me in supporting this bill. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4102\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Election Jamming Prevention \n     Act of 2006''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The most fundamental right accorded to United States \n     citizens by the Constitution is the right to vote, and \n     unimpeded exercise of the right to vote is essential to the \n     functioning of our democracy.\n       (2) Historically, significant efforts have been undertaken \n     to prevent qualified individuals from exercising this right.\n       (3) Poll taxes, property requirements, and literacy tests \n     were once used to restrict voters' access to the polls. Now, \n     efforts like deceptive practices, intimidation, and dirty \n     tricks are used to impede qualified voters' exercise of their \n     right to vote, to prevent voters from making informed \n     decisions as to how to cast that vote, and to prevent \n     candidates, parties, and organizations from engaging in \n     constitutionally protected political speech.\n       (4) In recent elections, there have been allegations of \n     political campaigns and committees using telephone jamming \n     techniques to shut down the communication operations of \n     groups supporting their political opponents.\n       (5) In November 2002, according to the Department of \n     Justice, groups working on behalf of the Republican \n     candidates in New Hampshire conspired to shut down Democratic \n     get-out-the-vote efforts by placing hang-up calls to the \n     phones of the Manchester Democratic Party and the Manchester \n     Professional Firefighters Association, which were providing \n     qualified voters rides to the election polling places. \n     Several people have pled guilty or been convicted in \n     connection with the incident.\n       (6) As a result of the hang-up call effort, the phone lines \n     of the Manchester Democratic Party and the Manchester \n     Professional Firefighters Association were jammed on election \n     day 2002 and qualified voters were unable to access \n     information that would have facilitated their access to \n     polling places.\n       (7) The use of telephones or other communication devices to \n     jam election-related communications should be prohibited in \n     order to protect qualified voters' right to vote.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PREVENTING OR OBSTRUCTING THE \n                   BROADCAST OR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION THROUGH \n                   TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEVICES.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--\n       (1) In general.--Subparagraph (C) of section 223(a)(1) of \n     the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 223(a)(1)(C)) is \n     amended by striking ``with the intent to annoy, abuse, \n     threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who \n     receives the communications;'' and inserting ``with the \n     intent to--\n       ``(i) annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the \n     called number or who receives the communications;\n       ``(ii) prevent or obstruct the broadcast or exchange of \n     election-related information; or\n       ``(iii) impair or obstruct any other telecommunications \n     device from being used to engage in communications containing \n     election-related information;''.\n       (2) Election-related information.--Subsection (h) of \n     section 223 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. \n     223(h)) is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(5) The term `election-related information' means \n     information related to--\n       ``(A) the endorsement, support, promotion of, or opposition \n     to any clearly identified candidate or slate of candidates \n     for the office of President, Vice President, presidential \n     elector, Member of the Senate, Member of\n\n[[Page S11503]]\n\n     the House of Representatives, or Delegate or Commissioner \n     from a territory or possession;\n       ``(B) the time, place, or manner for the election of such \n     offices; or\n       ``(C) the facilitation of transport to or from polling \n     places for any such election.''.\n       (b) Private Right of Action.--Section 223 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 223) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(i) Private Right of Action for Injunctive or Declarative \n     Relief Against Certain Actions.--Any person aggrieved by a \n     violation of subsection (a)(1)(C) may bring a civil action or \n     other proper proceeding for injunctive or declarative relief \n     in any court of competent jurisdiction, including an \n     application in a United States district court.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH:\n  S. 4104. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ncredit rate parity for all renewable resources under the electricity \nproduction credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide for credit rate parity under section 45 of the Internal Revenue \nCode for electricity from eligible renewable resources produced and \nsold after December 31, 2006.\n  Currently, certain renewable resources such as wind and closed-loop \nbiomass receive a credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour produced. For \nother renewables, such as open-loop biomass and incremental hydropower, \nthe amount of the credit is reduced by half.\n  I have been a longtime supporter of the production tax credit. There \nare significant wind facilities in Oregon, where we have over 335 \nmegawatts of installed wind capacity. These facilities provide clean \nenergy as well as important revenues to farmers and rural counties in \nEastern Oregon. My bill does not reduce the credit rate for wind but, \nrather, increases the rate for those renewables that are currently \neligible only for the reduced credit rate.\n  I have also heard from those industries that receive the reduced \ncredit rate about the disadvantage this creates for them in the \nmarketplace. Often, when bidding to provide green power, the difference \nin the credit rate makes the difference in being outbid. We should \nprovide a level playing field for all eligible renewables.\n  I applaud and support the current efforts to extend the existing \nsection 45 tax credits for renewables for another year. I hope that can \nbe accomplished before we adjourn sine die. In introducing this \nlegislation today, I want to begin the discussion that will lead to \nparity for all of the important new renewable technologies that can \nhelp us meet growing demands for electricity with clean, sustainable \nresources. As a member of the Finance Committee, this is an issue which \nI will pursue next Congress, and I hope that my colleagues will join me \nin this effort to encourage the development of renewable energy \nresources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 4107. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to replace \nthe Hope and Lifetime Learning credits with a partially refundable \ncollege opportunity credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the College \nOpportunity Tax Credit Act of 2006. This legislation creates a new tax \ncredit that will put the cost of higher education in reach for American \nfamilies.\n  An October 2006 College Board report found that this year tuition and \nother costs at public and private universities rose faster than \ninflation. And, according to the report, tuition and fees at public \nuniversities rose more in the past five years than at any other time in \nthe past 30 years, increasing by 35 percent to $5,836 this academic \nyear. Over the same time period, tuition and fees at private \nuniversities increased 22 percent to $22,218.\n  Unfortunately, neither student aid funds nor family incomes are \nkeeping pace with increasing tuition and fees. In my travels around the \ncountry, I frequently hear from parents concerned they will not be able \nto pay for college for their children. These parents know that earning \na college education will result in greater earnings for their children \nand they desperately want to ensure their kids have the greatest \nopportunities possible.\n  In 1997, we implemented two new tax credits to make college \naffordable--the HOPE credit and the lifetime learning credit. These tax \ncredits were important and have helped families afford college, but I \nbelieve we can do more. This week the Senate Finance Committee held a \nhearing on tax incentives for higher education in which we learned that \nthe existing tax credits are not reaching enough students, particularly \nlower income students who are most severely impacted by rising \ntuitions.\n  The HOPE and lifetime learning credits are not refundable, and \ntherefore a family of four must have an income over $30,000 in order to \nreceive the maximum credit. Almost half of families with college \nstudents fail to receive the full credit because their income is too \nlow. In order to receive the full benefit of the lifetime learning \ncredit, a student has to spend $10,000 a year on tuition and fees. This \nis nearly double the average annual public four-year college tuition \nand four times the average annual tuition of a community college. Over \n80 percent of college students attend schools with tuition and fees \nunder $10,000.\n  In 2004, I proposed a refundable tax credit to help pay for the cost \nof 4 years of college. Currently the HOPE Credit applies only to the \nfirst 2 years of college. The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of \n2006, COTC, helps students and parents afford all 4 years of college. \nIt also builds on the proposal I made in 2004 by incorporating some of \nthe suggestions made by experts, including those at this week's Finance \nCommittee hearing. My legislation creates a new credit that replaces \nthe existing HOPE credit and lifetime learning credit and ultimately \nmakes these benefits more generous.\n  The COTC has two components. The first provides a refundable tax \ncredit for a student enrolled in a degree program at least on a half-\ntime basis. It would provide a 100 percent tax credit for the first \n$1,000 of eligible expenses and a 50 percent tax credit to the next \n$3,000 of expenses. The maximum credit would be $2,500 each year per \nstudent. The second provides a nonrefundable tax credit for part-time \nstudents, graduate students, and other students that do not qualify for \nthe refundable tax credit. It provides a 40 percent credit for the \nfirst $1,000 of eligible expenses and a 20 percent credit for the next \n$3,000 of expenses.\n  Both of these credits can be used for expenses associated with \ntuition and fees. The same income limits that apply to the HOPE credit \nand the lifetime learning credit apply to the COTC: the COTC will be \nphased out ratably for taxpayers with income between $45,000 and \n$55,000--$90,000 and $110,000 for married taxpayers. These amounts are \nindexed for inflation, as are the eligible amounts of expenses.\n  The College Opportunity Tax Credit Act of 2006 simplifies the \nexisting credits that make higher education more affordable and will \nenable more students to be eligible for tax relief. I understand that \nmany of my colleagues are interested in making college more affordable. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to make a refundable tax \ncredit for college education a reality next Congress. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4107\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

                       ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 4109. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to prohibit \nthe operation of certain aircraft not complying with stage 3 noise \nlevels; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which would greatly \nimprove the quality of life for many residents of New Jersey, and \npeople across America, by reducing aircraft noise. The Aircraft Noise \nReduction Act of 2006 would greatly reduce unnecessary levels of noise \npollution by phasing out usage of the loudest aircraft still operating.\n  I have long had a strong interest in this issue; indeed, I first \nintroduced legislation calling for the phase-out of older, noisier \naircraft in 1990, and since then, significant progress has been made. \nAs we face an influx of many new aircraft to our system--some 5,000 new \nvery light jets, VLJs, are expected to enter the U.S. aviation market \nand our airspace in the next decade--now is the time to rid our skies \nof the older, noisier planes.\n  For purposes of rating aircraft noise levels, aircraft have to meet \nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency noise standards classified as \n``stages'': stage 1 and stage 2 noise levels are the loudest, while \nstage 3 and stage 4 (standards adopted just last year are the quietest. \nCommercial stage 1 aircraft were phased out by 1985, and Congress \nmandated the retirement of commercial stage 2 aircraft by 2000. \nHowever, these regulations only applied to aircraft weighing more than \n75,000 pounds; this means that there are still many loud business jets \nstill in service. The legislation I am introducing today would finally \nbring closure to this issue by phasing out the use of all remaining \nstage 1 and stage 2 aircraft in the United States.\n  The benefits of this total phase-out will be abundant. On average, \nolder, noisier stage 2 aircraft are twice as loud as newer, quieter, \nstage 3 planes. Unfortunately, at Teterboro Airport in my home State of \nNew Jersey, one of the largest general aviation airports in the \ncountry, loud stage 2 planes have been common until recently. This \ncontributed greatly to the noise pollution problems experienced in New \nJersey communities, and hurt property values for many citizens. It's \nprecisely why it is critically important to work toward a fleet devoid \nof stage 1 and stage 2 aircraft.\n  This issue has particular resonance in New Jersey, because Teterboro \nAirport and Morristown Airport, among others, are located in densely \npopulated areas. Stage 1 and 2 aircraft flying into these airports \nconstitute an unnecessary daily nuisance for, literally, hundreds of \nthousands of my constituents, and I believe it is time to take decisive \naction to correct the problem. Voluntarily banning these aircraft from \none airport will only force them to use another local airport, so I \nbelieve that a nationwide ban is necessary.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, this bill would not only help decrease \naircraft noise; it will also promote energy conservation. On average, \nstage 2 aircraft use 30 percent more fuel than otherwise comparable \nstage 3 jets, and passage of this bill would eliminate usage of many of \nthe most fuel-inefficient aircraft still operational in America.\n  My bill takes an approach which is sensitive to the economic hardship \nof communities who want to allow these\n\n[[Page S11505]]\n\naircraft to continue in use. Individual airports would still be allowed \nto opt-out of this measure by choosing to accommodate these noisier \nbusiness jets. Also, the act would not take effect until fully 3 years \nafter enactment, allowing ample time for businesses to adapt to the new \nregulations.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this bill represents a significant step \nforward in the ongoing efforts to control aircraft noise, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 4109\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Sadly, on November \n9, 2005, Jordan itself became a victim of terrorism. Terrorists \nattacked western hotels in its capital city, Amman, killing and \ninjuring scores of people.\n  This bill condemns the terrorist attacks that took place on November \n9 and reaffirms the support of the U.S. Government for the Jordanian \npeople and their government.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11505-3", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11505-S11506]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 628--SUPPORTING THE 200TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATION'S \n  NAUTICAL CHARTING AND RELATED SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMS, WHICH FORMED THE \n     BASIS FOR WHAT IS TODAY THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC \n                             ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nGregg, Mr. Lott, Mr. Reed, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Salazar, Mr.\n\n[[Page S11506]]\n\nAkaka, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Smith, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. Cochran) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 628\n\n       Whereas the Act of February 10, 1807 (chapter VIII; 2 Stat. \n     4113), signed by President Thomas Jefferson, authorized and \n     requested the President ``to cause a survey be taken of the \n     coast of the United States...together with such other matters \n     as he may deem proper for completing an accurate chart of \n     every part of the coasts'';\n       Whereas the Coast Survey was established to carry out the \n     duties established under such Act, and was the first Federal \n     science agency of the United States;\n       Whereas over time additional duties, including geodetic \n     surveying and tide and current monitoring and predictions, \n     were bestowed upon the agency, which was first known as the \n     U.S. Coast Survey and later the U.S. Coast and Geodetic \n     Survey;\n       Whereas, in addition to providing charts and information \n     vital to the young nation's economic and commercial success, \n     such pioneering agency led some of the nation's earliest \n     oceanographic research, undertaking surveys of the Gulf \n     Stream to determine temperatures, depths, direction, and \n     velocity as well as the character of the seafloor and forms \n     of vegetation and marine life;\n       Whereas the early technicians and scientists of such agency \n     invented and supported the development of many innovative \n     tools that led to advances in hydrographic, shoreline, and \n     geodetic surveying and cartographic methods, the first real-\n     time water level stations, and deep-sea anchoring;\n       Whereas during the 20th century such agency, by then re-\n     named the Coast and Geodetic Survey, advanced the development \n     and marine applications of electronics and acoustics, \n     including the development of Radar Acoustic Ranging, radio \n     sono-buoys and the Roberts Radio Current Meter Buoy;\n       Whereas throughout their history these programs have \n     provided services in support of the Nation's commerce and \n     defense serving in all theaters of the Civil War and in World \n     Wars I and II as hydrographers, cartographers, topographers, \n     and scouts, including the production of more than 100 million \n     maps and charts for U.S. and Allied forces;\n       Whereas our Nation's interests and economy became \n     increasingly interwoven with the marine and atmospheric \n     environment, a number of Federal science agencies with \n     complimentary functions, including the Weather Bureau and the \n     Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, were combined with such \n     agency to create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA);\n       Whereas today these mapping and charting, geodesy, and tide \n     and current data programs are located in the National Ocean \n     Service of NOAA, in the Coast Survey, the National Geodetic \n     Survey, and the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products \n     and Services;\n       Whereas these programs promote NOAA's commerce and \n     transportation goals and continue to support the research, \n     development and application of state-of-the-art surveying, \n     mapping, charting, ocean observing, modeling, and Internet-\n     based product delivery services to promote safe and efficient \n     commerce and transportation and contributing to the \n     advancement of integrated ocean and earth observing systems;\n       Whereas, these programs continue to demonstrate relevance, \n     value, importance, and service promoting and employing \n     innovative partnerships with other agencies, State and local \n     authorities, academia, and the private sector;\n       Whereas, these programs work internationally as the United \n     States representative to the International Hydrographic \n     Organization and through other organizations to promote \n     integrated and uniform standards, protocols, formats, and \n     services;\n       Whereas in addition to commerce and transportation these \n     programs also advance NOAA's weather and water, climate, and \n     ecosystem missions including marine resource conservation, \n     coastal management, and the protection of life and property \n     from coastal storms and other hazards, as most recently \n     demonstrated in responding to and facilitating the recovery \n     of communities and commerce in the hurricane stricken Gulf \n     Coast;\n       Whereas the devotion, industry, efficiency, and enterprise \n     of these people and programs over their 200-year history have \n     set an enviable record of public service: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved,  That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that for over 200 years, the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its predecessor \n     agencies have been providing the Nation research, service, \n     and stewardship of the marine environment, through products \n     and services that protect lives and property, strengthen the \n     economy, and support and sustain our coastal and marine \n     resources;\n       (2) recognizes the vision of President Thomas Jefferson in \n     supporting the advancement of science, and the survey of the \n     coast in particular, to the welfare and commercial success of \n     the Nation;\n       (3) recognizes the contributions made over the past 200 \n     years by the past and current employees and officers of the \n     Office of Coast Survey, the National Geodetic Survey, and the \n     Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services of \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to salute \n     and share in the planned celebrations of these historic \n     programs during 2007 with ceremonies designed to give \n     appropriate recognition to one of our oldest and most \n     respected Federal agencies on the occasion of its \n     bicentennial anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url":

PUGET SOUND REGIONAL SHELLFISH SETTLEMENT.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purpose.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the Tribes have established treaty rights to take \n     shellfish from public and private tidelands in Washington \n     State, including from some lands owned, leased, or otherwise \n     subject to harvest by commercial shellfish growers;\n       (B) the district court that adjudicated the Tribes' treaty \n     rights to take shellfish found that the growers are innocent \n     purchasers who had no notice of the Tribes' fishing right \n     when they acquired their properties;\n       (C) numerous unresolved issues remain outstanding regarding \n     implementation of the Tribes' treaty right to take shellfish \n     from lands owned, leased, or otherwise subject to harvest by \n     the growers;\n       (D) the Tribes, the growers, the State of Washington, and \n     the United States Department of the Interior have resolved by \n     a settlement agreement many of the disputes between and among \n     them regarding implementation of the Tribes' treaty right to \n     take shellfish from covered tidelands owned or leased by the \n     growers;\n       (E) the settlement agreement does not provide for \n     resolution of any claims to take shellfish from lands owned \n     or leased by the growers that potentially may be brought in \n     the future by other Tribes;\n       (F) in the absence of congressional actions, the prospect \n     of other Tribes claims to take shellfish from lands owned or \n     leased by the growers could be pursued through the courts, a \n     process which in all likelihood could consume many years and \n     thereby promote uncertainty in the State of Washington and \n     the growers and to the ultimate detriment of both the Tribes \n     and other Tribes and their members;\n       (G) in order to avoid this uncertainty, it is the intent of \n     Congress that other Tribes have the option of resolving their \n     claims, if any, to a treaty right to take shellfish from \n     covered tidelands owned or leased by the growers; and\n       (H) this Act represents a good faith effort on the part of \n     Congress to extend to other Tribes the same fair and just \n     option of resolving their claims to take shellfish from \n     covered tidelands owned or leased by the growers that the \n     Tribes have agreed to in the settlement agreement.\n       (2) Purpose.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to approve, ratify, and confirm the settlement \n     agreement entered into by and among the Tribes, commercial \n     shellfish growers, the State of Washington, and the United \n     States;\n       (B) to provide other Tribes with a fair and just resolution \n     of any claims to take shellfish from covered tidelands, as \n     that term is defined in the settlement agreement, that \n     potentially could be brought in the future by other Tribes; \n     and\n       (C) to authorize the Secretary to implement the terms and \n     conditions of the settlement agreement and this section.\n       (b) Approval of settlement agreement.--\n       (1) In general.--The settlement agreement is hereby \n     approved, ratified, and confirmed, and section 6 of the \n     settlement agreement, Release of Claims, is specifically \n     adopted and incorporated into this section as if fully set \n     forth herein.\n       (2) Authorization for implementation.--The Secretary is \n     hereby authorized to implement the terms and conditions of \n     the settlement agreement in accordance with the settlement \n     agreement and this section.\n       (c) Fund, Special Holding Account, and Conditions.--\n       (1) Puget sound regional shellfish settlement trust fund.--\n       (A) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the \n     United States an account to be designated as the ``Puget \n     Sound Regional Shellfish Settlement Trust Fund''. The \n     Secretary shall deposit funds in the amount of $22,000,000 at \n     such time as appropriated pursuant to this section into the \n     Fund.\n       (B) The Fund shall be maintained and invested by the \n     Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act of June 24, \n     1938, (25 U.S.C. 162a) until such time as all monies are \n     transferred from the Fund.\n       (C) The Secretary shall transfer monies held in the Fund to \n     each Tribe of the Tribes in the amounts and manner specified \n     by and in accordance with the payment agreement established \n     pursuant to the settlement agreement and this section.\n       (2) Puget sound regional shellfish settlement special \n     holding account.--\n       (A) There is hereby established in the Treasury of the \n     United States a fund to be designated as the ``Puget Sound \n     Regional Shellfish Settlement Special Holding Account''. The \n     Secretary shall deposit funds in the amount of $1,500,000 \n     into the Special Holding Account in fiscal year 2011 at such \n     time as such funds are appropriated pursuant to this section.\n       (B) The Special Holding Account shall be maintained and \n     invested by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Act \n     of June 24, 1938, (25 U.S.C. 162a) until such time as all \n     monies are transferred from the Special Holding Account.\n       (C) If a court of competent jurisdiction renders a final \n     decision declaring that any of the other Tribes has an \n     established treaty right to take or harvest shellfish in \n     covered tidelands, as that term is defined in the settlement \n     agreement, and such tribe opts to accept a share of the \n     Special Holding Account, rather than litigate this claim \n     against the growers, the Secretary shall transfer the \n     appropriate share of the monies held in the Special Holding \n     Account to each such tribe of the other Tribes in the amounts \n     appropriate to compensate the other Tribes in the same manner \n     and for the same purposes as the Tribes who are signatory to \n     the settlement agreement. Such a transfer to a tribe shall \n     constitute full and complete satisfaction of that tribe's \n     claims to shellfish on the covered tidelands.\n       (D) The Secretary may retain such amounts of the Special \n     Holding Account as necessary to provide for additional tribes \n     that may judicially establish their rights to take shellfish \n     in the covered tidelands within the term of that Account, \n     provided that the Secretary pays the remaining balance to the \n     other Tribes prior to the expiration of the term of the \n     Special Holding Account.\n       (E) The Tribes shall have no interest, possessory or \n     otherwise, in the Special Holding Account.\n       (F) Twenty years after the deposit of funds into the \n     Special Holding Account, the Secretary shall close the \n     Account and transfer the balance of any funds held in the \n     Special Holding Account at that time to the Treasury. \n     However, the Secretary may continue to maintain the Special \n     Holding Account in order to resolve the claim of an Other \n     Tribe that has notified the Secretary in writing within the \n     20-year term of that Tribe's interest in resolving its claim \n     in the manner provided for in this section.\n       (G) It is the intent of Congress that the other Tribes, if \n     any, shall have the option of agreeing to similar rights and \n     responsibilities as the Tribes that are signatories to the \n     settlement agreement, if they opt not to litigate against the \n     growers.\n       (3) Annual report.--Each tribe of the Tribes, or any of the \n     other Tribes accepting a settlement of its claims to \n     shellfish on covered lands pursuant to paragraph (2)(C), \n     shall submit to the Secretary an annual report that describes \n     all expenditures made with monies withdrawn from the Fund or \n     Special Holding Account during the year covered by the \n     report.\n       (4) Judicial and administrative action.--The Secretary may \n     take judicial or administrative action to ensure that any \n     monies withdrawn from the Fund or Special Holding Account are \n     used in accordance with the purposes described in the \n     settlement agreement and this section.\n       (5) Clarification of trust responsibility.--Beginning on \n     the date that monies are transferred to a tribe of the Tribes \n     or a tribe of the other Tribes pursuant to this section, any \n     trust responsibility or liability of the United States with \n     respect to the expenditure or investment of the monies \n     withdrawn shall cease.\n       (d) State of Washington Payment.--The Secretary shall not \n     be accountable for nor incur any liability for the \n     collection, deposit, management or nonpayment of the State of \n     Washington payment of $11,000,000\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\n     to the Tribes pursuant to the settlement agreement.\n       (e) Release of Other Tribes Claims.--\n       (1) Right to bring actions.--As of the date of enactment of \n     this section, all right of any other Tribes to bring an \n     action to enforce or exercise its treaty rights to take \n     shellfish from public and private tidelands in Washington \n     State, including from some lands owned, leased, or otherwise \n     subject to harvest by any and all growers shall be determined \n     in accordance with the decisions of the Courts of the United \n     States in United States v. Washington, Civ. No. 9213 (Western \n     District of Washington).\n       (2) Certain rights governed by this section.--If a tribe \n     falling within the other Tribes category opts to resolve its \n     claims to take shellfish from covered tidelands owned or \n     leased by the growers pursuant to subsection (c)(2)(C) of \n     this section, that tribe's rights shall be governed by this \n     section, as well as by the decisions of the Courts in United \n     States v. Washington, Civ. No. 9213.\n       (3) No breach of trust.--Notwithstanding whether the United \n     States has a duty to initiate such an action, the failure or \n     declination by the United States to initiate any action to \n     enforce any other Tribe's or other Tribes' treaty rights to \n     take shellfish from public and private tidelands in \n     Washington State, including from covered tidelands owned, \n     leased, or otherwise subject to harvest by any and all \n     growers shall not constitute a breach of trust by the United \n     States or be compensable to other Tribes.\n       (f) Cause of Action.--If any payment by the United States \n     is not paid in the amount or manner specified by this \n     section, or is not paid within 6 months after the date \n     specified by the settlement agreement, such failure shall \n     give rise to a cause of action by the Tribes either \n     individually or collectively against the United States for \n     money damages for the amount authorized but not paid to the \n     Tribes, and the Tribes, either individually or collectively, \n     are authorized to bring an action against the United States \n     in the United States Court of Federal Claims for such funds \n     plus interest.\n       (g) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Fund.--The term ``Fund'' means the Puget Sound \n     Shellfish Settlement Trust Fund Account established by this \n     section.\n       (2) Growers.--The term ``growers'' means Taylor United, \n     Inc.; Olympia Oyster Company; G.R.

Mr. President, I would like to thank Commerce \nCommittee co-chairmen Stevens and Inouye for their hard work in \nachieving this bill's passage. H.R. 5782 the Pipeline Inspection, \nProtection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 is a timely piece of \nlegislation, and I hope that it will soon become law. I am proud to be \none of the original cosponsors of the Senate version of this bill, \nS.3961.\n  Our 2.3 million miles of natural gas and hazardous liquid pipelines \nare more than simply a series of tubes. This system is the \ntransportation mode for nearly two-thirds of the energy consumed by our \nNation. From large transmission pipelines to distribution pipelines to \nservice lines which run into our homes, every part of this system must \nbe safe.\n  I am pleased that Congress is acting to reauthorize the Office of \nPipeline Safety, OPS, and bringing its resources more in line with what \nis needed to adequately regulate this industry. This bill would \nauthorize 50 percent more Federal pipeline safety inspectors than the \nFederal Government currently has.\n  The bill will change Federal policy to help prevent construction-\nrelated damage to pipelines by giving additional enforcement authority \nto OPS and authorizing grants to states to improve one-call \nnotification programs. At the same time, it will also make OPS \nenforcement actions more transparent to those interested in what the \nFederal Government is doing to make their lives safer. Furthermore, \nthis bill will also regulate for the first time low-stress oil \npipelines, such as the ones in Prudhoe Bay, AK, and gas distribution \npipelines all over the country.\n  One subject in the bill I was proud to author deals with the \nmandatory use of excess flow valves. These important safety devices can \nshut off gas flow when a service line is ruptured, preventing a \npotential explosion. One lesson we learned after the 1994 gas explosion \nin Edison, NJ, is that technology must be used to shut off gas flow in \nthe case of a rupture. Shortly after that damaging explosion, I \nintroduced legislation to require a greater use of automatic or \nremotely controlled shutoff valves. I am pleased that this bill will \nrequire excess flow valves to be installed in every new single family \nresidence or replacement service lines in a single family residence.\n  While the bill would give some discretion to the administration as to \nwho may be exempted from this EFV requirement, I have met with Admiral \nBarrett, Administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety \nAdministration, and he assures me that only operators of master meter \nand liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, systems are intended to be excluded. \nOn these systems, he believes EFVs have not been shown to be effective.\n  By letter to me dated December 4, 2006, Admiral Barrett of the \nFederal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration wrote to \nme:\n\n\n              Requiring Installation of Excess Flow Valves\n\n  The American Gas Association has provided data that leads PHMSA to \nbelieve that 1.2 million new and renewed gas services will be installed \neach year. PHMSA had been planning to propose to require each operator \nto include in its risk analysis consideration of whether to install \nEFV's to protect single-family residences served by new and replaced \ngas service lines from release of gas due to major damage to the line. \nModifications to the reauthorization provisions will change PHMSA \nplanned approach, but would allow PHMSA to determine applicability of \nthe future standard to distribution operators. The circumstances where \nPHMSA believes conditions for installation of EFV's are not suitable \nare when gas supply pressure is not continuously higher than 10 psig, \nwhen liquids/contaminants that could interfere with valve operation are \npresent in the gas stream, and where load data may be unstable.\n  Based on current data, we would expect to apply the requirements for \nEFV's to more than 99 percent of new and replaces residential service \nlines. PHMSA plans to exclude from the requirement only operators of \nmaster meter and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) systems. These are very \nsmall distribution systems, whose operation of gas is incidental to \nanother business, such as a mobile home park or small apartment \ncomplex, in the case of the master meter operator; or a ski lodge, in \nthe case of the LPG operator. The variability in gas use is too large \nto pick one size EFV and most incidents would not trigger an EFV. We \nestimate that approximately 8,000 of these systems would be excluded \nfrom the EFV requirement. The estimate is based on reports in 2004 from \n(1) 45 state pipeline safety agencies that collectively 6,972 master \nmeter systems were operating in their states and (2) 5 state pipeline \nsafety agencies indicating that 926 LPG systems were operating in their \nstates. Because some states do not have jurisdiction over all master \nmeter systems\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\nin their states, the number reported may slightly understate the actual \nnumber. Further, we estimate that, on average, for each master meter \nand LPG system the operator has 100 services.\n  I will continue to work with Senator Inouye in the next Congress, who \nwill chair the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, to \ndetermine the feasibility of requiring these important safety devices \nin types of buildings as well--other than single family residences as \nwell as safety advocates including the National Transportation Safety \nBoard have suggested is feasible. These safety devices can provide \ncrucial protection in the event of a pipeline rupture or similar \nincident, and technology has advanced to the point where they are \neffective and readily available. Many pipeline companies are already \nusing excess flow valves in such installations.\n  I thank all those who worked toward an agreement on this provision \nand all those who helped pass this bill. A gas leak in a home can be a \nsilent killer, with little warning; we must utilize technology which is \navailable to keep our families safe.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Sebold.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, after 33 years of service to the U.S. \nSenate, Linda Sebold has decided to retire. Linda began her Senate \ncareer with the Office of the Secretary of the Senate back in August of \n1973, and until this day Linda remains totally dedicated to the Senate. \nAfter 5 years as an assistant in the Disbursing Office, Linda became \nthe Committee Scheduling Coordinator for the Daily Digest. In time, \nthrough dedication and hard work, Linda was named the Assistant Editor \nof the Digest, and in the spring of 1999, Linda was appointed Editor of \nthe Digest.\n  Throughout Linda's years of service, the combination of her \nexperience and work ethic allowed her to produce a top flight Daily \nDigest. The Digest is one those valuable Senate resources thoroughly \nexamined the first thing each morning by many Senate and House \nstaffers. Some people with Linda's years of experience might have \nbecome complacent, but throughout her service, Linda remained vigilant, \nworking closely with Senate committee staff, the Government Printing\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\nOffice, the Senate Sergeant at Arms technical development staff, the \nSecretary's information technology staff, and her counterparts in the \nHouse of Representatives in search of possible improvements for the \nDigest.\n  Over the years, Linda's achievements were not limited to the Daily \nDigest. Linda's recommendations led to numerous improvements being \nimplemented to the Senate-wide Legislative Information System. Linda \nhas contributed significantly to the Senate's continuity of operations \nplanning. Linda has been a true leader among the Secretary's \nlegislative staff. Linda has been the ultimate teacher and mentor for \nall those fortunate enough to have worked with her. During her time \nwith the Senate, one of Linda's most important roles has been the time \nshe has taken to counsel and encourage young people, especially ``young \nmoms,'' with respect to the personal demands associated with working \nSenate hours.\n  As our Senate family says goodbye to Linda and thanks her for always \nhaving the best interest of the Senate at heart over the past 33 years, \nit is also fitting that we acknowledge her greatest accomplishment, her \nbeautiful family. It is our wish that Linda, her loving husband Jerry, \nher son Brian and daughter Karen, enjoy a future filled with health, \nhappiness, and many treasured memories. We thank Linda's family for \ntheir many sacrifices during Linda's career and sincerely thank them \nfor sharing Linda with the Senate.\n  Thank you, Linda.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the end of the 109th Congress marks the end \nof a very distinguished career of Linda Sebold, Editor of the Senate \nDaily Digest.\n  After 33 years of Senate service, Linda has decided that she will \nretire and spend time with her family. Linda began her Senate career \nwith the Office of the Secretary of the Senate in August 1973, and \nremained a totally dedicated Senate employee.\n  Through her hard work and dedication, Linda advanced through the \nranks and was named Assistant Editor of the Digest, and in the spring \nof 1999, Linda was appointed Editor of the Digest.\n  Over the course of Linda's Senate career, she had made numerous \ncontributions which have been instrumental in the development of the \nSenate-wide Legislative Information System, LIS. Additionally, she had \nworked diligently in the area of the Senate's continuity of operations \nplanning. Linda has been a true leader in the Senate's legislative \nstaff operations.\n  It is our hope and wish that Linda, along with her husband Jerry and \nher children, Brian and Karen, will enjoy many days and family fun, and \nwe wish her well as she embarks on her adventure of retirement.\n  Good luck, Linda, and thank you very much for your service to the \nSenate and the Nation.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Res. 628\n\n       Whereas the Act of February 10, 1807 (chapter VIII; 2 Stat. \n     4113), signed by President Thomas Jefferson, authorized and \n     requested\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\n     the President ``to cause a survey be taken of the coast of \n     the United States . . . together with such other matters as \n     he may deem proper for completing an accurate chart of every \n     part of the coasts'';\n       Whereas the Coast Survey was established to carry out the \n     duties established under such Act, and was the first Federal \n     science agency of the United States;\n       Whereas over time additional duties, including geodetic \n     surveying and tide and current monitoring and predictions, \n     were bestowed upon the agency, which was first known as the \n     U.S. Coast Survey and later the U.S. Coast and Geodetic \n     Survey;\n       Whereas, in addition to providing charts and information \n     vital to the young nation's economic and commercial success, \n     such pioneering agency led some of the nation's earliest \n     oceanographic research, undertaking surveys of the Gulf \n     Stream to determine temperatures, depths, direction, and \n     velocity as well as the character of the seafloor and forms \n     of vegetation and marine life;\n       Whereas the early technicians and scientists of such agency \n     invented and supported the development of many innovative \n     tools that led to advances in hydrographic, shoreline, and \n     geodetic surveying and cartographic methods, the first real-\n     time water level stations, and deep-sea anchoring;\n       Whereas during the 20th century such agency, by then re-\n     named the Coast and Geodetic Survey, advanced the development \n     and marine applications of electronics and acoustics, \n     including the development of Radar Acoustic Ranging, radio \n     sono-buoys and the Roberts Radio Current Meter Buoy;\n       Whereas throughout their history these programs have \n     provided services in support of the Nation's commerce and \n     defense serving in all theaters of the Civil War and in World \n     Wars I and II as hydrographers, cartographers, topographers, \n     and scouts, including the production of more than 100 million \n     maps and charts for U.S. and Allied forces;\n       Whereas our Nation's interests and economy became \n     increasingly interwoven with the marine and atmospheric \n     environment, a number of Federal science agencies with \n     complimentary functions, including the Weather Bureau and the \n     Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, were combined with such \n     agency to create the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration (NOAA);\n       Whereas today these mapping and charting, geodesy, and tide \n     and current data programs are located in the National Ocean \n     Service of NOAA, in the Coast Survey, the National Geodetic \n     Survey, and the Center for Operational Oceanographic Products \n     and Services;\n       Whereas these programs promote NOAA's commerce and \n     transportation goals and continue to support the research, \n     development and application of state-of-the-art surveying, \n     mapping, charting, ocean observing, modeling, and Internet-\n     based product delivery services to promote safe and efficient \n     commerce and transportation and contributing to the \n     advancement of integrated ocean and earth observing systems;\n       Whereas, these programs continue to demonstrate relevance, \n     value, importance, and service promoting and employing \n     innovative partnerships with other agencies, State and local \n     authorities, academia, and the private sector;\n       Whereas, these programs work internationally as the United \n     States representative to the International Hydrographic \n     Organization and through other organizations to promote \n     integrated and uniform standards, protocols, formats, and \n     services;\n       Whereas in addition to commerce and transportation these \n     programs also advance NOAA's weather and water, climate, and \n     ecosystem missions including marine resource conservation, \n     coastal management, and the protection of life and property \n     from coastal storms and other hazards, as most recently \n     demonstrated in responding to and facilitating the recovery \n     of communities and commerce in the hurricane stricken Gulf \n     Coast;\n       Whereas the devotion, industry, efficiency, and enterprise \n     of these people and programs over their 200-year history have \n     set an enviable record of public service: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, by the Senate That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that for over 200 years, the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its predecessor \n     agencies have been providing the Nation research, service, \n     and stewardship of the marine environment, through products \n     and services that protect lives and property, strengthen the \n     economy, and support and sustain our coastal and marine \n     resources;\n       (2) recognizes the vision of President Thomas Jefferson in \n     supporting the advancement of science, and the survey of the \n     coast in particular, to the welfare and commercial success of \n     the Nation;\n       (3) recognizes the contributions made over the past 200 \n     years by the past and current employees and officers of the \n     Office of Coast Survey, the National Geodetic Survey, and the \n     Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services of \n     the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to salute \n     and share in the planned celebrations of these historic \n     programs during 2007 with ceremonies designed to give \n     appropriate recognition to one of our oldest and most \n     respected Federal agencies on the occasion of its \n     bicentennial anniversary.\n\n       ESTABLISHING A PROCEDURE FOR AFFIXING AND REMOVING

Mr. President, today, we pay special tribute to a giant \nof sports in Massachusetts we are proud to call our own. I was honored \nto speak at his memorial service in Boston, and I am honored today to \noffer this resolution on the one and only Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach, who \ndied in October at the age of 89.\n  Red was a pioneer in sports and in civil rights as well. He has been \nwidely praised as one of the architects of the new Boston. He will \nnever be forgotten--and there will never be another like him.\n  Basketball was his sport, and the Celtics he led with the legendary \nBob Cousy and incomparable Bill Russell set the gold standard for the \nNBA for many years and transformed his city as well as his sport.\n  The stories of his competitive drive have become legendary. Red had a \ndeep and abiding passion for life and for living each day as if it was \na gift from above. Whenever you were in his presence, you could sense \nthe powerful joy that comes to the rare few like Red Auerbach, who know \nthey have done everything possible in every way on every day to achieve \ntheir dream.\n  Red Auerbach was a great coach and also a great man. He believed in \nwinning, but he also believed that every individual should have the \nchance to be a winner. In the 1950s, before every Celtics game Red \nwould invite a few children to play a brief game of basketball, \ncomplete with uniforms, official referees, and all the rest on the \nfamous Boston Garden parquet floor. One player would be from the CYO, \none from Chinatown, one from Roxbury, and one from the Young Men's \nHebrew Association.\n  Long before anyone ever dreamed of it, Red had created his own \n``Rainbow Coalition,'' and he continued to champion civil rights all \nhis life. He was the first to go overseas with American players to \nteach basketball to children in Europe and Asia, and he deserves \nimmense credit for making it the international game it is today.\n  But his heart was in Boston, where he single-handedly put basketball \non the map. He created the famous Celtic ``magic & mystique,'' and \nrenewed it year after year with exciting basketball. In the end, he led \nthe Celtics to 9 world championships as coach--8 in a row and 16 world \nchampionships altogether. He was voted greatest coach of all time by \nthe Professional Basketball Writers of America.\n  Few giants in the world are known by one name--Cher, Madonna, Elvis, \nBono, and our very own ``Red.'' He will be greatly missed and never \nforgotten, and his record of success will probably never be matched \nanywhere.\n  It is an honor to urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nresolution. Even if you rooted against the Celtics, Red Auerbach made \nyour home team great, too.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to express my thanks to all of my \ncolleagues for adopting this resolution to honor the memory of Boston's \ngreatest sports champion and legend, Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach. Plain and \nsimple, Red Auerbach was basketball. He was more than just the greatest \nNBA coach of all time; he was the creator of the modern professional \ngame.\n  Through the selection of the likes of Cousy, Russell, Havlicek, and \nBird, Red built the greatest basketball dynasty in history. During two \ndecades of coaching, Red Auerbach won 938 games and led the Boston \nCeltics to a record 9 National Basketball Association, NBA, \nchampionship titles. He was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame \ntwice, once for his coaching and once for his contributions to the \ngame. In 1980, Red was voted the greatest coach in NBA history by the \nProfessional Basketball Writers Association of America. Fourteen of \nRed's players have been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. \nAfter moving to the Celtics front office in 1966, Red's knowledge of \nbasketball was instrumental in helping the Celtics win seven additional \nNBA titles.\n  In 1985, a life-size sculpture of Red Auerbach was placed in Boston's \nhistoric Faneuil Hall Marketplace to honor Red's contributions to the \nBoston Celtics and the city of Boston.\n  Most importantly, Red was known as a visionary and for his fierce \nloyalty to the people who worked for the Boston Celtics. From the \nplayers, to the coaches, to the ball boys, Red recognized the goodness \nin people and brought out the greatness in everyone he touched. He was \nan agent of change, hiring the first African-American coach in all of \npro sports and drafting the league's first African-American player.\n  Red will be forever remembered as Boston's greatest winner on the \ncourt, but through the Red Auerbach Youth Foundation, he made a \ndifference in thousands of young lives throughout Massachusetts. Red's \nfoundation focuses on getting children, who would not otherwise \nparticipate, involved in sports and to bring children of all racial and \nethnic backgrounds together through sports.\n  Red was also a proud Navy man. The values of honor, commitment, and \nintegrity that Red brought to his coaching were also taught in the Navy \nwhere he served so proudly. The Navy's ``Lone Sailor Award,'' which he \nrecently received, will sit in a special place of honor in this giant's \ntrophy case along with an awe inspiring number of championship \ntrophies.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his children, Randy and Nancy, and \nhis granddaughter Julie during this very difficult time. We take \ncomfort knowing he is once again in the arms of his beloved Dot. While \nwe may never again catch a whiff of that unforgettable cigar smoke or \nsee him shake his rolled up program at a bad call by an official again, \nwe will never forget the man who taught us how to win again and \ninspired a city to be champions. Boston--indeed America--lost one of \nits finest with Red's passing. And I am so pleased that the U.S. Senate \nis honoring his life today by passing this resolution\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nconcurrent resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating thereto be printed in the Record without intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 497) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/12/07/senate-section/article/S11546-2", "month": "12", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11546-S11548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AMENDING THE CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE EQUITABLE COMPENSATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The sustained commitment of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) to mutual defense has made possible the \n     democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. \n     Members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization can and \n     should play a critical role in addressing the security \n     challenges of the post-Cold War era in creating the stable \n     environment needed for those emerging democracies in Europe.\n       (2) Lasting stability and security in Europe requires the \n     military, economic, and political integration of emerging \n     democracies into existing European structures.\n       (3) In an era of threats from terrorism and the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization is increasingly contributing to \n     security in the face of global security challenges for the \n     protection and interests of its member states.\n       (4) In the NATO Participation Act of 1994 (title II of \n     Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress declared \n     that ``full and active participants in the Partnership for \n     Peace in a position to further the principles of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty and to contribute to the security of the \n     North Atlantic area should be invited to become full NATO \n     members in accordance with Article 10 of such Treaty at an \n     early date . . . ''.\n       (5) In the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title \n     VI of section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law \n     104-208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress called for the prompt \n     admission of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and \n     Slovenia to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and \n     declared that ``in order to promote economic stability and \n     security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, \n     Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine . . . the process of \n     enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and \n     Eastern Europe should not be limited to consideration of \n     admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia \n     as full members of the NATO Alliance''.\n       (6) In the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of \n     division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), \n     Congress declared that ``Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in \n     Central and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO'' and that \n     ``Romania, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria . . . \n     would make an outstanding contribution to furthering the \n     goals of NATO and enhancing stability, freedom, and peace in \n     Europe should they become NATO members [and] upon complete \n     satisfaction of all relevant criteria should be invited to \n     become full NATO members at the earliest possible date''.\n       (7) In the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act \n     of 2002 (Public Law 107-187; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), Congress \n     endorsed \n     ``. . . the vision of further enlargement of the NATO \n     Alliance articulated by President George W. Bush on June 15, \n     2001, and by former President William J. Clinton on October \n     22, 1996''.\n       (8) At the Madrid Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in July 1997, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \n     Republic were invited to join the Alliance, and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state and government \n     issued a declaration stating ``[t]he alliance expects to \n     extend further invitations in coming years to nations willing \n     and able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of \n     membership . . . [n]o European democratic country whose \n     admission would fulfill the objectives of the [North \n     Atlantic] Treaty will be excluded from consideration''.\n       (9) At the Washington Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in April 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization heads of state and government issued a \n     communique declaring ``[w]e pledge that NATO will continue to \n     welcome new members in a position to further the principles \n     of\n\n[[Page S11549]]\n\n     the [North Atlantic] Treaty and contribute to peace and \n     security in the Euro-Atlantic area . . . [t]he three new \n     members will not be the last . . . [n]o European democratic \n     country whose admission would fulfill the objectives of the \n     Treaty will be excluded from consideration, regardless of its \n     geographic location . . . ''.\n       (10) In May 2000 in Vilnius, Lithuania, the foreign \n     ministers of Albania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     the Republic of Macedonia, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia \n     issued a statement (later joined by Croatia) declaring that--\n       (A) their countries will cooperate in jointly seeking \n     membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the \n     next round of enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization;\n       (B) the realization of membership in the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization by one or more of these countries would \n     be a success for all; and\n       (C) eventual membership in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization for all of these countries would be a success \n     for Europe and for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n       (11) On June 15, 2001, in a speech in Warsaw, Poland, \n     President George W. Bush stated ``[a]ll of Europe's new \n     democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that \n     lie between, should have the same chance for security and \n     freedom--and the same chance to join the institutions of \n     Europe--as Europe's old democracies have . . . I believe in \n     NATO membership for all of Europe's democracies that seek it \n     and are ready to share the responsibilities that NATO brings \n     . . . [a]s we plan to enlarge NATO, no nation should be used \n     as a pawn in the agenda of others . . . [w]e will not trade \n     away the fate of free European peoples . . . [n]o more \n     Munichs . . . [n]o more Yaltas . . . [a]s we plan the Prague \n     Summit, we should not calculate how little we can get away \n     with, but how much we can do to advance the cause of \n     freedom''.\n       (12) On October 22, 1996, in a speech in Detroit, Michigan, \n     former President William J. Clinton stated ``NATO's doors \n     will not close behind its first new members . . . NATO should \n     remain open to all of Europe's emerging democracies who are \n     ready to shoulder the responsibilities of membership . . . \n     [n]o nation will be automatically excluded . . . [n]o country \n     outside NATO will have a veto . . . [a] gray zone of \n     insecurity must not reemerge in Europe''.\n       (13) At the Prague Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in November 2002, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, \n     Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia were invited to \n     join the Alliance in the second round of enlargement of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization since the end of the Cold \n     War, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of \n     state and government issued a declaration stating ``NATO's \n     door will remain open to European democracies willing and \n     able to assume the responsibilities and obligations of \n     membership, in accordance with Article 10 of the Washington \n     Treaty''.\n       (14) On May 8, 2003, the United States Senate unanimously \n     approved the Resolution of Ratification to Accompany Treaty \n     Document No. 108-4, Protocols to the North Atlantic Treaty of \n     1949 on Accession of Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia, inviting Bulgaria, Estonia, \n     Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia to join \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n       (15) At the Istanbul Summit of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in June 2004, the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization heads of state and government issued a \n     communique reaffirming that NATO's door remains open to new \n     members, declaring ``[w]e celebrate the success of NATO's \n     Open Door Policy, and reaffirm tody that our seven new \n     members will not be the last. The door to membership remains \n     open. We welcome the progress made by Albania, Croatia, and \n     the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (1) in implementing \n     their Annual National Programmes under the Membership Action \n     Plan, and encourage them to continue pursuing the reforms \n     necessary to progress toward NATO membership. We also commend \n     their contribution to regional stability and cooperation. We \n     want all three countries to succeed and will continue to \n     assist them in their reform efforts. NATO will continue to \n     assess each country's candidacy individually, based on the \n     progress made towards reform goals pursued through the \n     Membership Action Plan, which will remain the vehicle to keep \n     the readiness of each aspirant for membership under review. \n     We direct that NATO Foreign Ministers keep the enlargement \n     process, including the implementation of the Membership \n     Action Plan, under continual review and report to us. We will \n     review at the next Summit progress by aspirants towards \n     membership based on that report''.\n       (16) Georgia has stated its desire to join the Euro-\n     Atlantic community, and in particular, is seeking to join \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Georgia is working \n     closely with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its \n     members to meet criteria for eventual membership in NATO.\n       (17) At a press conference with President Mikhail \n     Saakashvili of Georgia in Washington, D.C. on July 5, 2006, \n     President George W. Bush stated that `` . . . I believe that \n     NATO would benefit with Georgia being a member of NATO, and I \n     think Georgia would benefit. And there's a way forward \n     through the Membership Action Plan . . . And I'm a believer \n     in the expansion of NATO. I think it's in the world's \n     interest that we expand NATO''.\n       (18) Following a meeting of NATO Foreign Ministers in New \n     York on September 21, 2006, NATO Secretary General Jaap de \n     Hoop Scheffer announced the launching of an Intensified \n     Dialogue on membership between the Alliance and Georgia.\n       (19) Contingent upon their continued implementation of \n     democratic, defense, and economic reform, and their \n     willingness and ability to meet the responsibilities of \n     membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \n     Congress calls for the timely admission of Albania, Croatia, \n     Georgia, and Macedonia to the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization to promote security and stability in Europe.\n       (20) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization heads of state \n     and government will hold a North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     Summit in Riga, Latvia, in November 2006.\n\n     SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY.\n\n       Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its previous expressions of support for \n     continued enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization contained in the NATO Participation Act of 1994, \n     the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996, the European \n     Security Act of 1998, and the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom \n     Consolidation Act of 2002;\n       (2) supports the commitment to further enlargement of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include European \n     democracies that are able and willing to meet the \n     responsibilities of Membership, as expressed by the Alliance \n     in its Madrid Summit Declaration of 1997, its Washington \n     Summit Communique of 1999, its Prague Summit Declaration of \n     2002, and its Istanbul Summit Communique of 2004; and\n       (3) endorses the vision of further enlargement of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization articulated by President George \n     W. Bush on June 15, 2001, and by former President William J. \n     Clinton on October 22, 1996, and urges our allies in the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization to work with the United \n     States to realize a role for the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization in promoting global security, including \n     continued support for enlargement to include qualified \n     candidate states, specifically by entering into a Membership \n     Action Plan with Georgia and recognizing the progress toward \n     meeting the responsibilities and obligations of NATO \n     membership by Albania, Croatia, Georgia, and Macedonia at the \n     NATO Summit in Riga, Latvia.\n\n     SEC. 4. DESIGNATION OF ALBANIA, CROATIA, GEORGIA, AND \n                   MACEDONIA AS ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE \n                   UNDER THE NATO PARTICIPATION ACT OF 1994.\n\n       (a) Designation.--\n       (1) Albania.--The Republic of Albania is designated as \n     eligible to receive assistance under the program established \n     under section 203(a) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 \n     (title II of Public Law 103-447; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), and \n     shall be deemed to have been so designated pursuant to \n     section 203(d)(1) of such Act.\n       (2) Croatia.--The Republic of Croatia is designated as \n     eligible to receive assistance under the program established \n     under section 203(a) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994, \n     and shall be deemed to have been so designated pursuant to \n     section 203(d)(1) of such Act.\n       (3) Georgia.--Georgia is designated as eligible to receive \n     assistance under the program established under section 203(a) \n     of the NATO Participation Act of 1994, and shall be deemed to \n     have been so designated pursuant to section 203(d)(1) of such \n     Act.\n       (4) Macedonia.--The Republic of Macedonia is designated as \n     eligible to receive assistance under the program established \n     under section 203(a) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994, \n     and shall be deemed to have been so designated pursuant to \n     section 203(d)(1) of such Act.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--The designation of the Republic \n     of Albania, the Republic of Croatia, Georgia, and the \n     Republic of Macedonia pursuant to subsection (a) as eligible \n     to receive assistance under the program established under \n     section 203(a) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994--\n       (1) is in addition to the designation of Poland, Hungary, \n     the Czech Republic, and Slovenia pursuant to section 606 of \n     the NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996 (title VI of \n     section 101(c) of title I of division A of Public Law 104-\n     208; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), the designation of Romania, \n     Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Bulgaria pursuant to section \n     2703(b) of the European Security Act of 1998 (title XXVII of \n     division G of Public Law 105-277; 22 U.S.C. 1928 note), and \n     the designation of Slovakia pursuant to section 4(a) of the \n     Gerald B.
