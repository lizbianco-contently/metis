Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, at 5:20 p.m., we have an order to proceed \nto executive session to consider the nomination of Francisco Besosa to \nbe U.S. district judge for the District of Puerto Rico. The agreement \nprovides for 10 minutes of debate prior to a vote on the nomination, \nwhich will occur at 5:30 p.m.\n  I have said repeatedly over the last days and weeks that we will be \nfinishing our work at the end of this week. Accordingly, I ask for the \ncooperation of all of our colleagues as we bring together a lot of \nlegislation that has been produced over a long period of time, but over \nthe course of the week it will be a challenge to consider all of that \nlegislation. It is going to take cooperation and working together to \nallow us to continue to govern with these meaningful solutions, \nchallenges, and issues which have been set before us.\n  We have the pending border fence legislation that we will need to \ncomplete. We have legislation relating to the terrorist tribunals, the \nmilitary commissions, the Hamdan decision that will be considered and \nfinished prior to adjournment. In addition, we have several conferences \nthat will be completed in the next several days--Defense appropriations \nand Homeland Security appropriations--that we absolutely must finish \nthis week as well. Other legislation, such as port security, is being \nworked on very aggressively, and I believe we should be able to finish \nthat bill and bring it to the floor as well.\n  We have a very small window in which to complete our business over \nthe next 6 days. I have said our intention is to finish on Friday, \nalthough if we are unable to do that, of course, we will be here on \nSaturday to wrap things up. I will update my colleagues over the course \nof the week on progress that is being made and how that affects plans. \nAt this point, cooperation is key and flexibility with people's \nschedules will be key in order that we get our work done and leave at \nthe end of the week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10051-8", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10051-S10052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 3925, S. 3929, S. 3930, S. 3931\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, we may not see it on the front page, \nbut there is good news. Last Friday, the U.S. Army met its annual \nrecruiting goal more than a week ahead of schedule. This will cap the \nArmy's best recruiting year since 1997.\n  Let me repeat that. The Army will be completing its best recruiting \nyear in almost a decade--this despite all the gloom and doom we have \nheard about young people not wanting to serve their country in the war \non terror.\n  On Friday, in New York City, Shirley Salvi, a 23-year-old graduate of \nRutgers, joined the Army as the 80,000th soldier to enlist this year. \nThat is 80,000 soldiers this year. She will report to Fort Leonard Wood \nin Missouri to become either an Army linguist or intelligence analyst.\n  In spite of all the danger and all the hardship and sacrifice \ninvolved, thousands of young Americans, such as Ms. Salvi, are stepping \nforward to say: I will defend my country.\n  We have an All-Volunteer Army, and it is the best in the world. While \nthe enemy fights solely to instill fear and death, our soldiers fight \nfor the hope and opportunity that only comes with liberty.\n  Before the fiscal year is over, the Army anticipates having a total \nof 504,000 soldiers--an increase of 12,000 from last year. The Army \nReserve and Army National Guard also expect to meet their recruiting \ngoals for this year. This increased recruiting comes even as \nadministrators in a number of institutions of higher learning and even \nsome high schools remain openly hostile to military recruiting on \ncampus.\n  Retention in the Army also shows encouraging signs. In July of this \nyear, GEN Pete Schoomaker, Chief of Staff of the Army, noted that the \nreenlistment rate for two of the divisions deployed in Iraq was over \n140 percent. One of those divisions, I am proud to report, is the 101st \nAirborne located in my home State of Kentucky.\n  I think what this good recruiting and retention news reflects is \nbasically three things:\n  First, it reflects the patriotism and commitment of today's youth. \nThe generation coming of age today has grown up with the war on terror, \nand they understand its importance. They understand the need to defend \nAmerica's values. They understand what is at stake, and they want to do \ntheir part by volunteering to protect the Nation from al-Qaida and \nothers who would do this Nation harm.\n  Second, I think this good Army recruiting news reflects the \nrecognition by today's youth that a career in the military is, indeed, \na noble calling. In fact, it is hard to think of anything more \nhonorable than serving and protecting America.\n  Third, the achievement of the Army's recruiting goal a week early \nsends a strong signal to our allies and our enemies in the war on \nterror. It shows that the American people are resolute in defending our \nNation and in defending freedom.\n  I must say, I take some pride in this good news about recent \nrecruiting numbers since the U.S. Army recruiting command is located at \nanother base in my State, Fort Knox. The command is doing a great job \nfor America.\n  I salute Ms. Salvi and the thousands of other volunteers like her who \nhave joined the Army this year. I thank them for their patriotism and \nfor their future service on behalf of our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10052-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10052-S10053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON IRAQ AND THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about \noversight hearings on Iraq and the global war on terror.\n  Just last week, our good friend, the Democratic leader, complained \nthat there has not been ``a single oversight hearing, none.'' That was \nour good friend, the Democratic leader, saying there hasn't been a \nsingle oversight hearing on Iraq and the global war on terror. But the \nSenate has conducted scores of hearings on Iraq and related issues \nsince 2003. For example, the Armed Services Committee held more than \n20--20--hearings on such topics as military operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, operations and strategy in Iraq, and Iraq-Afghanistan and \nthe global war on terrorism. That is 20 hearings by the Armed Services \nCommittee alone. The Foreign Relations Committee has held more than 30 \nhearings in the past 3 years, including hearings on post-Saddam Iraq, \non the status of and prospect for Iraq reconstruction, Iraq's \ntransition to sovereignty, and post-transition Iraq. That is 30 \nhearings by the Foreign Relations Committee on Iraq and the war on \nterror in the last 3 years. And then there is the Judiciary Committee, \nthe Banking Committee, and the Homeland Security Committee hearings. \nAll told, more than 80--80--hearings have been held on Iraq and related \nissues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a listing of all of these hearings to \nwhich I just referred indicating the Senate has engaged in extensive \noversight on the war in Iraq and the war on terror over the last 3 \nyears be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Senate Foreign Relations Committee

Mr. President, it is only 1:50 p.m. in New Orleans, but \nthe bands have been marching since early this morning, and the singing \nis joyful. People have been so excited not only in New Orleans but in \nall of Louisiana because tonight the Saints will be marching again into \nthat grand, wonderful building we call the Superdome.\n  The Superdome has always been a special symbol to New Orleans, but \ntonight that symbol takes on a new meaning. It has been a symbol of \npride in the past, and tonight it is a symbol of hope--a symbol of hope \nfor the great rebuilding of our wonderful city, region, and State.\n  Just a year ago, the Superdome was a symbol of sadness, loss, \nconfusion, and despair as New Orleans, the region, and our State faced \nthe worst natural disaster in the history of this country. It wasn't \njust Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that caused devastation, it was also \nthe levees that collapsed and put a great city and region under some 20 \nto 25 feet of water. It was in that overwhelming flood that people fled \nto the Dome looking for safety and security. All of America knows this \nsad story.\n  But I am here to talk about a story of recovery, a story of \nleadership. I want to thank the people who made the Dome's reopening \npossible--to thank the men and women who work at the Dome: the welders, \nthe janitors, the cleanup crews, the construction crews, the managers, \nthe architects, and the engineers.\n  They spent the whole year rebuilding this Dome on a schedule that no \none thought was possible, at a cost that came under budget. A \npartnership formed between the NFL, the State of Louisiana, and the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency to get this building back into \nshape and reopen tonight with 68,000 fans coming to watch the Saints \nplay the Atlanta Falcons.\n  I want to remind the country that these employees showed up to work \neach day to restore the Dome, many of them traveling hours to get there \nin the morning and hours back in the evening because there were no \nnearby houses for them to sleep. Many of them lost their homes, their \nchildren lost their schools, and their churches were destroyed.\n  The successful rebuilding of the Dome is because of the people who \nshowed up to work. Their journeys in the morning and their journeys \nhome show a commitment to rebuilding a great city. Despite the \ncriticism that the city, the State and the region have received, \ntonight is a symbol of all that is great about the spirit of the people \nwho refuse to let this city die.\n  Desiree Jones, who lives in Violet, La., is the housekeeping manager \nfor the Superdome. She started working at the Dome 25 years ago as a \njanitor. Every day for the past two weeks, she has been working to get \nthe Dome ready for tonight. She knows the Dome's reopening is a signal \nof rebirth for our city.\n  I come to the floor to thank the thousands of men and women who \nworked on the Superdome. The were\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\nled by a wonderful leader, a young man who has really shown his stripes \nand all of New Orleans is singing his praises: Doug Thornton, the \ngeneral manager of the Dome. He stayed in the Superdome with his wife \nand children doing everything he could to help the evacuees. His heroic \nefforts during those harrowing days a year ago have been well reported. \nBut what might not be known is that Doug and his wife also lost their \nhome. He didn't see his wife for weeks because he spent his time \nrebuilding the Dome while Denise spent time rebuilding their house in \nLakeview. That is what people all over New Orleans and South Louisiana \nand the Gulf Coast are doing--going to work to rebuild the refineries, \nthe pipelines, the industries, while their spouses are at home \nrebuilding what is left of their houses.\n  Doug Thornton, general manager of the Superdome, is no exception. He \ndeserves a tremendous amount of credit.\n  Tim Coulon, the chairman of the Louisiana Stadium Exhibition \nDistrict, is a former Jefferson Parish president and a man I know well. \nTim has always been a very quiet but competent and effective leader. \nHis leadership doesn't come from loud speeches and pushing but from \nquiet determination. Tim, his staff, and other board members worked \nvery closely with Governor Blanco, who signed executive order after \nexecutive order, to cut through the redtape and expedite the \nSuperdome's rebuilding.\n  That partnership between our Governor, the stadium commissioners, and \nDoug Thornton was the leadership team that put this Superdome back \ntogether.\n  I also have to say for the record that Paul Tagliabue, former \ncommissioner of the NFL, saw what happened at the Superdome and decided \nthat the NFL was a service organization, and its first job was to \nservice teams and the cities. He understands something about the \nemotional connection between the teams and the cities that host them. \nThe teams become a part of the spirit of every city, and he would not \nallow the Saints' spirit to die.\n  He said the Saints will march again. He said the Dome will be \nrebuilt, and let's get to it. New Orleans will forever be grateful to \nPaul Tagliabue and his staff at the NFL for their belief in our city \nand for not cutting and running, not leaving when times got tough for \nus. They stood their ground, and we are very grateful.\n  I also want to go on the record to say that the Dome has been a \nsymbol of our city for 31 years. Its origin goes back to Governor John \nMcKeithen. He was not from New Orleans. He was actually a country boy \nfrom Columbia, LA. But as our Governor, he had a vision of what a great \nDome could mean to a great American city, a great southern city. He, \nalong with the mayor at that time, my father, Moon Landrieu, along with \nDave Dixon, a local businessman, decided the Dome would mean renewal \nfor the city. The three of them overcame all sorts of political hurdles \nand were able to build this great Dome.\n  We have hosted more Super Bowls than any building in America. It sits \non 52 acres of land in the central business district. The Superdome has \na seating capacity of over 70,000, depending on the event.\n  When Dave Dixon had a vision for this Dome, he told our Governor at \nthe time: You know, Governor, we will have a Pope here one day and a \nPresident here one day.\n  Nobody believed him when he said that. But sure enough, President \nReagan honored all of us when the Republican National Convention came \nto New Orleans 18 years ago.\n  It was a proud time for New Orleans and Louisiana when 19 years ago, \nPope John Paul II made the first ever Papal visit to Louisiana and held \na rally in front of 80,000 children in that Dome. It was a site to \nbehold.\n  We have had a proud Superdome history right there on the corner of \nPoydras and Loyola, right across the street from city hall. It will be \nthere for years to come because the heroic efforts of the employees at \nthe Dome and our local contractors who put their shoulders to the wheel \nand their hearts into their work and decided that this would be a \nsymbol of our rebirth.\n  I am proud as the Senator from the great State of Louisiana to come \nand honor them, to thank them, and to say that this is the beginning of \nour recovery. This week, we close a chapter on Hurricane Rita, which, \nMr. President, hit your own State of Texas, and which did so much \ndamage to both Louisiana and Texas. I visited Louisiana this past \nweekend with some of Louisiana's delegation and local leaders. It is \nclear that recovery has begun, but there is still a long way to go.\n  As we close the Rita and Katrina chapters of the last year, let the \nSaints go marching in tonight, and let them lead us to a new chapter of \nhope and recovery for New Orleans, for Louisiana, for the whole gulf \ncoast, and for all of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeMINT). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10054-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10054-S10056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BORDER FENCING\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the House and Senate have a piece of \nlegislation more commonly known as the Fence bill, but it is really a \nbill to establish operational control of our borders through fencing \nand other means. It includes authorization for 700 specific miles \nfencing along the Mexican border and a study of the situation on the \nnorthern border. It is designed to help multiply the capacity of \nAmerican Border Patrol agents to be effective in creating a lawful \nborder instead of the unlawful border we have.\n  It passed the House with a strong bipartisan vote. They have had five \nformal hearings on the matter and have considered information from \nprevious hearings. They had a number of field hearings in August and \nthey actually talked to people in the region to find out what is going \non.\n  The House has sent the Senate a bill they have worked on for some \ntime and to which they have given a great deal of thought. It is very \nsimilar to the bill we passed in the Senate which authorized 870 total \nmiles of physical infrastructure at the border.\n  Let me take a moment to discussion the history of the legislation in \nthis Senate dealing with barriers at the border. I will discuss why the \nbarriers are an important component--not all of what we need to do, but \nan essential component of what we need to do--to create a lawful system \nof immigration. But first let us talk about the votes we have had in \nthe Senate.\n  On May 17, I offered an amendment that mandated the construction of \n370 miles of fencing and 500 miles of vehicle barriers along the \nsouthwest border of the United States. That is a total of 870 miles of \nphysical barriers. This is not a lot different from what the House is \nsending the Senate, some 700 or so miles of fencing. When we voted on \nmy amendment, we discussed it at some length.\n  I did not know how we would vote. I didn't know how the vote would \nturn out. A number of Members said they were for fencing; a number of \nMembers said they were against fencing. I argued that good fences make \ngood neighbors. It clarifies where property lines are, what your rights \nare, and neighbors can get along pretty well. Leave them ambiguous, and \npeople get in fusses.\n  At any rate, when we voted, the vote was 83 to 16 to approve my \namendment mandating construction of this fence. That was part of the \noverall immigration bill. That immigration bill was fatally flawed. The \ntruth is, it is not going to become law. We can all be thankful for \nthat.\n  This amendment, though, was voted on 83 to 16. A lot of our \ncolleagues say, I voted for an amendment to build a fence; I voted as \none of the 83. But, we all are grownups, we know that legislation \ncontaining that amendment is not going to become law. So, now it is \ntime to either put up or shut up about enforcement. It is time to \neither be honest with our constituents and say, I am not going to vote \nfor a stand alone fence bill, or, yes, I believe a fence is an \nimportant component of border security and I will vote for this bill \nbecause it takes the first step.\n  So where did the Senate go after the first vote of 83 to 13? I \nsuggest that strong vote indicated border fencing and barriers are a \nhigh priority of this Senate. This was a strong bipartisan vote, if \npeople were voting with integrity, to build a fence.\n  We had a second vote. One of the things that is unusual about the \nSenate, to people who are not used to it, is\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\na vote to authorize a matter--a subject, a fence--is not the end of it. \nBefore that construction can take place, the Congress has to vote again \nto appropriate the money to build it. It takes two votes. One vote can \nbe a signal, but it does not have any reality until a second vote is a \nfact.\n  When the Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill hit the \nSenate, we were more than a little disappointed that even though the \noriginal vote was 83 to 16, when we come along with the Department of \nHomeland appropriations bill, what did we see? Thirty-nine miles of \nvehicle barriers only. This was most discouraging.\n  I urged my colleagues, if they were serious about the previous vote, \nwe ought to have a vote to actually fund it. I offered an amendment \nthat would actually have funded this fence at $1.8 billion which we \nthink if we get someone to run it as it ought to be run and build it in \na cost-effective way, it would be enough to meet that standard. I \noffered that amendment on July 13. It would have reduced a percent or \ntwo of funding for other appropriations in the bill, an across-the-\nboard reduction, and we voted on it. Unfortunately, only 29 Senators \nvoted to actually appropriate the money to do what they had already \nvoted to do.\n  That was very discouraging to me. I talked about it, particularly the \nfact that if there is one area where the American people are most \ncynical about Congress, it is about their protestations they are doing \neverything they can do to create a lawful system of immigration when \nthey are actually not. They are very cynical about that. They have \nevery right to be. The American people have understood this issue for \n30 years. No President, no Congress, has listened to them and done what \nactually needs to be done and could be done to create a lawful system \nof immigration. This was most troubling.\n  So we continued to study what could be done to get fencing built. On \nAugust 2 the Defense bill was in the Senate. The National Guard had \nbeen deployed to the border and was making some progress, assisting \nthose at the border--not as much as some would like and would hope, but \nit has made a positive step. They have the capability of building some \nfencing and actually were already working on some fencing projects. \nAgain, I offered an amendment on the floor to actually fund the \nfencing, this time through the Defense Department, through the National \nGuard. The amendment would have let them either build the fencing \nthemselves, or manage private contractors who would build a fence.\n\n  When we voted on that amendment, perhaps after my colleagues had \nspent some time talking to their constituents, the vote to authorize \n$1.8 billion for funding passed 93 to 3. So we got 93 to 3. Now we are \ncooking. We have money, we have actually put up money to follow through \non the fencing idea. I was very happy about that.\n  In the course of the conference on the Defense appropriations \nlegislation that we won the amendment vote on, I was informed they were \nmoving $1.8 billion from the Department of Defense bill over to \nHomeland Security bill which was also in their conference because that \nwas the more appropriate vehicle to put funding to build a fence for \nHomeland Security. So, I was told that the Homeland Security \nAppropriators would handle it.\n  Now we are hearing that less money for the fence is going to be \nincluded in the conference report, that was included in my amendment. \nThere was an article in the paper today, one of the Web sites of the \nAP, saying they agreed to $1.2 billion instead of $1.8 billion. That is \na 30-percent reduction. We voted to fund a $1.8 billion one-time \nexpenditure to build miles of fence and barriers. It is something that \nought to be done at one time and it will save money in great amounts \nover the long term.\n  I am worried about that reduction in funding. Some have said the \nnumbers may even be worse than that because those in charge of the \nprocess feel an obligation to fund other things related to Homeland \nSecurity and they may not even appropriate the full $1.2 billion for \nfencing construction. I hope that is not so. I think that would be \nunacceptable. That would be inconsistent with the votes we have had and \nwould not make Congress look good. It would not be the kind of action \nworthy of a Senate that is attempting to gain the respect of the \nAmerican people on the subject of immigration, a subject about which \nthey have lost the respect of the American people and deserve to get \nback.\n  So the House passed a bill. They passed an authorization bill that \nmandates the fencing, very similar to what the Senate voted for, and is \nnow before the Senate. A filibuster was suggested, indicated by the \nseveral procedural votes we have had to have on this bill. The majority \nleader had to file for cloture on the motion to proceed. That gives 30 \nhours of debate. Then 30 hours later, we voted on the motion to proceed \nand we did not see the filibuster continue. The vote was 94 to 0 to \nproceed to the Secure Fence Act. It took a lot of time, not much \ndebate. I was one of the few Members who spoke. The 30 hours slowed \ndown everything we were doing.\n  The people are saying, I am for a vote, I voted for cloture. Why did \nwe have to have cloture? Why couldn't we move straight to the bill as \nwe do time and time again in this Senate--although less and less, as \ntime has gone by. We are in a slowdown mode. We are moving along now. \nWe will have a vote, I thought today, on cloture on the bill. However, \nit looks as though that may be tomorrow. Then we will have another 30 \nhours of debate. Then we will have an opportunity or complaints about \nhow many amendments can be offered or fall. Who knows where this will \ngo?\n  There are some Members who like to claim they support barriers at the \nborder, but when the chips are down, through legerdemain in this body, \nmanage to create logjams and headaches so it will never become law if \nit appears that is their wish. I suspect we will have people who say \nthey want to add amendments on comprehensive reform, on amnesty, on \nagriculture jobs or other issues that would kill this amendment if \nadopted. They want to try to offer those amendments. Or they are \ncomplaining that virtual fencing, some sort of a satellite, unmanned \naerial vehicle, can do the same thing as a fence. That is not so. It \ncan be an asset, but it cannot replace individual people apprehending \npeople coming across the border illegally--not a virtual fence. How \nsilly is that? They will say they do not favor the locations where the \nfencing is or they will say they favor fencing, but they really favor \ncomprehensive reform and if we pass anything such as fencing, even \nthough the American people want it, then the American people will not \npass their version of amnesty or whatever they want to see in the form \nof comprehensive reform.\n  They are afraid the American people will get what they want, and if \nthe American people get what they want in terms of increased \nenforcement, they may not be so interested in their ideas about how to \nreach final settlement on amnesty.\n  We will have two real votes on fencing this week: cloture on the \nunderlying bill and final passage. We should be able to achieve cloture \nand final passage. It takes 60 votes, but we have had 80, 90 votes on \nthis before. Without this authorization language, there will be no \nmandate that the fencing act will be constructed or in what manner it \nwill be constructed.\n  So these votes are the real test this week--not the final test, but \nvery critical steps in the process. The American people will want to \nwatch and see if they agree with their Senators in how they vote. I \nnote we will also have to have some more votes somewhere along the line \nthat are also critical that deal with actual funding of the border \nbarriers.\n  I see my colleague from Oklahoma is in the Chamber, my distinguished \ncolleague on the Armed Services Committee, who chairs the Environment \nand Public Works Committee. I ask my colleague, do you have a time \nagreement to speak? What is your schedule?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am going to be requesting unanimous \nconsent to be recognized for up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. All right. I will wrap up and be pleased to yield to \nthe Senator. The Senator is going to ask unanimous consent to be \nrecognized after I finish?\n  Mr. INHOFE. After the Senator concludes, yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will continue a couple more minutes.\n  Fencing works. We have a major problem. Last year, our Border Patrol\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\nagents apprehended 1.12 million people along our border coming into our \ncountry unlawfully. Can you imagine that? Where we did build fencing \nalong the San Diego border--only 14 miles, but it was one of the worst \nareas--that area was tremendously improved. Crime went down, drug \ndealing went down, violence went down, illegal immigration plummeted \nand property values went up.\n  But we have 1,800 miles along the border. This bill would not provide \nfunding and authorization but for fencing about one-third of that \ndistance.\n  I will share with my colleagues some of the debate in the House of \nRepresentatives recently, as they passed the very bill that is before \nus. Chairman Royce--he is from California--who chairs the International \nTerrorism and Nonproliferation Subcommittee talked about the \ndifficulties they have had with a breach, a gap in the border fencing. \nHe said this: It is called ``smugglers' gulch,'' a fence that runs from \nthe foothills to the ocean through that small 3-mile breach. It has \ntaken 8\\1/2\\ years to get the California Coastal Commission to go along \nwith closing that fence in consultation--8\\1/2\\ years to get it done.\n  He talked about the problem of that gap. And he talked about the \nfield hearings he had participated in. He said: We heard from \nwitnesses, and we heard them express that border fencing was very \neffective. He quoted Darryl Griffen, who is the chief agent in San \nDiego for the Border Patrol--the chief agent. Mr. Griffen, referring to \nthe fencing, said this: It is a great force multiplier. It expands our \nenforcement capacity. It allows us the discretion to redeploy agents to \nareas of vulnerability or risk. It is one component that certainly has \nbeen integral to everything we have accomplished here raising the level \nof security.\n  That is what the chief of the Border Patrol for San Diego said. So \npeople will tell you fencing makes no difference, it is not important, \nit does not help. It is not so. Listen to the professionals. I know \nPresident Bush has been reluctant to support fencing, but this man \nworks for President Bush. He testified, as has Secretary Chertoff, \nabout the subject. Secretary of Homeland Security Chertoff supports the \nfence, the bill that we passed in the Senate. Indeed, it was passed on \nhis recommendation, the details of it were.\n  Then Chairman Royce, in the House, who chairs the International \nTerrorism Subcommittee, said this about the dangerous people who are \ncoming across the border: So we see people coming over the border \nillegally from Afghanistan, Angola, Jordan, Qatar, Pakistan, Yemen. And \nI will give you one example. Mohammed Karani is the brother of a \ncommander of Hezbollah in south Lebanon. He came over the border in my \nState in the trunk of a car. He paid a coyote to get him across the \nborder. He was later arrested in Dearborn, Michigan. He is serving 4\\1/\n2\\ years. He is a member of Hezbollah. He was in the process of \nsecuring funds and resources for Hezbollah in the United States.\n  He then goes on to say: Two border Governors have declared states of \nemergency over illegal immigration. Then one of the agents told him a \npersonal story of stopping a man who had been trained in an Afghan \ntraining camp originally from Uzbekistan. This man injured the Border \nPatrol agent, actually bit his arm as he was trying to take him down. \nThis agent told Chairman Royce one of his concerns was this was the \nsecond time the man had tried to come into the country after 9/11.\n  So I would say we are dealing with an important issue. I am glad to \nsee from previous votes that the Senate is coming around to a uniform \nposition on it. It is time for us now, as we wind up this session, to \nfulfill our obligation for actually making a law, legislation to \nauthorize the building of the fence, and then, in the few days we have \nleft, to come forward with legislation that will actually fund this \nrequirement we authorize. Otherwise, we risk going home and even \nfurther arousing cynicism and irritation among the voters who have sent \nus here.\n  I believe we can get it done. I think we are moving in the right \ndirection. I am optimistic. But there will be some around here who \nwould like to see it fail in the last minute. Let's don't let that \nhappen. Let's follow through, and let's be consistent with the wishes \nof the American people and the security of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 1 hour in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me first say to my friend from Alabama \nthat as to the last comment he made about whether at the last minute \nsomeone may come along and try to torpedo this, I suspect that might be \nthe case. It is like when I had the amendment to make English our \nnational language--and 89 percent of the American people were for it; \n70 percent of the Hispanics were for it--and yet some of the liberals \nin this Chamber were catering to La Raza, an extremist group, in trying \nto torpedo what we are doing, and merely doing what 51 other countries \nhave done, making English the official language.\n  I also want to say to my friend from Alabama, I have never been \nprouder to serve on the Armed Services Committee with any member more \nthan I am to serve with him. It was you and seven other of the \nRepublicans who tried from the very beginning to give the President \neverything he needed to interrogate these people, to prosecute these \npeople, and to get as much human intelligence as possible to save \nAmerican lives. I thank the Senator publicly for standing up as one of \nall nine of us.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think the \nSenator has provided great leadership on security on a number of \nissues. You may be talking about other issues as we go forward right \nnow, but I know the Senator would agree that our borders do represent \nvulnerabilities, and fixing our borders is also an aspect of national \nsecurity, as I read of Hezbollah people coming across and others who \nhave dangerous reputations.\n  I also thank the Senator for his steadfast leadership and his clear \nthinking in regard to the fundamental issue that barriers do represent \na critical part of what we need to do to have a lawful border.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. And I \nthink we will prevail. As to what you are suggesting, and what you have \nbeen suggesting over the last few minutes, the vast majority of the \nAmerican people are on our side. They know as to people who say: You \ncannot secure our border, fences will not work--they worked for a long \ntime up in between North Korea and South Korea. I think they will work \ndown here, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10056-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10056-S10062]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE.

It is the word that gets \neverybody upset when you say it and the word or the phrase that many \npoliticians are afraid to say, and that is ``global warming.'' I have \nspoken more about global warming than any other politician in \nWashington today. My speech will be a bit different from the previous \nseven floor speeches I have made on this subject, as I focus not only \non the science, as I have many times before, but on the media's \ncoverage of climate change.\n  Global warming--just the term--evokes many Members in this Chamber, \nthe media, Hollywood elites, and our pop culture to nod their heads and \nfret about an impending climate disaster. As the Senator who has spent \nmore time educating about the actual facts about global warming, I will \naddress some of the recent media coverage of global warming and \nHollywood's involvement in this issue. And, of course, I will also \ndiscuss former Vice President Al Gore's movie, ``An Inconvenient \nTruth.''\n  Let's keep in mind, I do chair the committee in the Senate called \nEnvironment and Public Works, the committee that has jurisdiction. I \nrecall so well when I first became chairman of this committee, almost 4 \nyears ago, I was actually a believer that because I had heard it so \nmany times there must be something to this thing, until I started \nlooking at the science. But I have talked about that before.\n  Since 1895, the media has alternated between global cooling and \nglobal\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\nwarming scares during four separate and sometimes overlapping time \nperiods. From 1895 until the 1930s, the media peddled a coming ice age. \nFrom the late 1920s until the 1960s, they warned of global warming. \nFrom the 1950s until the 1970s, they warned us again of a coming ice \nage. This makes modern global warming the fourth estate's fourth \nattempt to promote opposing climate change fears during the last 100 \nyears--4 times during the last 100 years--and every time just as \nhysterical as the time before.\n  Recently, advocates of alarmism have grown increasingly desperate to \ntry to convince the public that global warming is the greatest moral \nissue of our generation. Just last week, the vice president of London's \nRoyal Society sent a chilling letter to the media encouraging them to \nstifle the voices of scientists skeptical of climate alarmism.\n  During the past year, the American people have been served up an \nunprecedented parade of environmental alarmism by the media and \nentertainment industry, which links every possible weather event to \nglobal warming. The year 2006 saw many major organs of the media \ndismiss any pretense of balance and objectivity on climate change \ncoverage and instead crossed squarely on into global warming advocacy.\n  First, I will summarize some of the recent developments in the \ncontroversy over whether humans have created a climate catastrophe. One \nof the key aspects the United Nations, environmental groups, and the \nmedia have promoted as the ``smoking gun'' of proof of catastrophic \nglobal warming is the so-called hockey stick temperature graph by \nclimate scientist Michael Mann from Virginia and some of his liberal \ncolleagues.\n  This graph purported to show that temperatures in the northern \nhemisphere remained relatively stable over 900 years, and then spiked \nupward as we moved into the 20th century. And that spike would be the \n``blade'' on the hockey stick. They say this was due to human activity. \nMann, who also copublishes a global warming propaganda blog--reportedly \nset up with the help of an environmental group--had his hockey stick \ncome under severe scrutiny.\n  The hockey stick was completely and thoroughly broken once and for \nall in 2006. Several years ago, two Canadian researchers tore apart the \nstatistical foundation for the hockey stick. In 2006, both the National \nAcademy of Sciences and an independent researcher further refuted the \nfoundation of the hockey stick.\n  The National Academy of Sciences report reaffirmed the existence of \nthe Medieval Warming Period. That was from about 900 AD to 1300 AD, and \nthe Little Ice Age from about 1500 to approximately 1850. Both of these \nperiods occurred long before the invention of the SUV or human \nindustrial activity and it could not have possibly impacted the Earth's \nclimate. In fact, scientists believe the Earth was warmer than today \nduring the Medieval Warming Period, when the Vikings grew crops in \nGreenland. We all remember reading about that. That was a period of \ntime when the Vikings, all of a sudden, because it became warmer back \naround 1000 AD, started inhabiting Greenland. They flourished up there, \nuntil the Little Ice Age came along in 1500, and most of them died at \nthat time. Now the climate alarmists have attempted to erase the \ninconvenient Medieval Warming Period from the Earth's climate history \nfor at least a decade.\n  David Demming, an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma's \nCollege of Geosciences, can testify firsthand about this effort. Dr. \nDemming was welcomed into the close-knit group of global warming \nbelievers after he published a paper in 1995 that noted some warming in \nthe 20th century. He says he was subsequently contacted by a prominent \nglobal warming alarmist and told point blank:\n\n       We have to get rid of the medieval warming period.\n\n  When the ``hockey stick'' first appeared in 1998, it did exactly \nthat. This guy, Michael Mann, turned around and ignored the fact that \nwe had this medieval warming period and then went into the little ice \nage, which changed it.\n  The media has missed big pieces of the puzzle when it comes to the \nEarth's temperatures and mankind's carbon dioxide, CO2, \nemissions. It is very simplistic to feign horror and say the 1-degree \nFahrenheit temperature increase in the 20th century means we are all \ndoomed. First of all, the 1-degree Fahrenheit rise coincided with the \ngreatest advancement in living standards, life expectancy, food \nproduction, and human health in the history of our planet. So it is \nhard to argue that the global warming we experienced in the 20th \ncentury was somehow negative or part of a catastrophic trend.\n  Here on the chart you can see during this period of time, when things \nwere flourishing and they went down, it was far more prosperous during \nthe medieval part.\n  Second, what the climate alarmists and their advocates in the media \nhave continued to ignore is the fact that the little ice age, which \nresulted in harsh winters which froze New York Harbor and caused untold \ndeaths, ended about 1850. So trying to prove manmade global warming by \ncomparing the well-known fact that today's temperatures are warmer than \nduring the little ice age is like comparing summer to winter to show a \ncatastrophic temperature trend.\n  In addition, something that the media almost never addresses are the \nholes in the theory that CO2 has been the driving force in \nglobal warming.\n  The alarmists fail to adequately explain why temperatures began \nwarming at the end of the little ice age in about 1850, long before \nmanmade CO2 emissions could have impacted the climate. Then \nin about 1940, just as manmade CO2 emissions rose sharply--\nabout 80 percent, with the largest increase in the middle of the \n1940s--the temperatures began a decline, and that lasted until about \nthe 1970s, prompting the media and many scientists to fear a coming ice \nage.\n  I am saying that this increase in CO2 emissions did not \nprecipitate a warming period; it precipitated a cooling period.\n  If CO2 is the driving force of the global climate change, \nwhy do so many in the media ignore the many skeptical scientists who \ncite these rather obvious inconvenient truths?\n  My skeptical views on manmade catastrophic global warming have only \nstrengthened as new science comes in. There have been recent findings \nin peer-reviewed literature over the past few years showing that the \nAntarctic is getting colder, and ice is growing. And a new study in \nGeophysical Research Letters found that the Sun was responsible for 50 \npercent of the 20th century warming. Now, that is shocking: the Sun is \nresponsible for warmth.\n  Recently, many scientists, including a leading member of the Russian \nAcademy of Sciences, predicted long-term global cooling may be on the \nhorizon due to a projected decrease in the Sun's output. It is going to \nstart getting cooler again.\n  A letter that was sent to the Canadian Prime Minister on April 6 of \nthis year by 60 prominent scientists who question the basis for climate \nalarmism, clearly explains the current state of the scientific \nknowledge on global warming. Keep in mind, these 60 scientists were the \nones who recommended back in the 1990s that Canada sign onto the Kyoto \nTreaty. They wrote this to Prime Minister Harper:\n\n       If, back in the mid-1990s, we knew what we know today about \n     climate, Kyoto would almost certainly not exist, because we \n     would have concluded that it was not necessary.\n\n  The letter also noted:\n\n       ``Climate change is real'' is a meaningless phase used \n     repeatedly by activists to convince the public that a climate \n     catastrophe is looming and humanity is the cause. Neither of \n     these fears is justified. Global climate changes occur all \n     the time due to natural causes, and the human impact still \n     remains impossible to distinguish from the natural ``noise.''\n\n  These are scientists talking. People realize that these cycles go on. \nGod is still up there, and we have the cycles every 1,500 years or so. \nEvery time this happens, alarmists get this out and say we are all \ngoing to die.\n  One of the ways alarmists have pounded the mantra of a ``consensus'' \non global warming into our pop culture is through the use of computer \nmodels that project future calamity. But the science is not there to \nplace so much faith in scary computer model scenarios which extrapolate \nthe current and projected buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \nand conclude that the planet faces certain doom.\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n  Dr. Vincent Gray, a research scientist and a 2001 reviewer with the \nU.N. Intergovernmental Panel--they started like most bad things do, \nwith the U.N. Back in the 1990s they came out with the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and Dr. Gray said:\n\n       The effects of aerosols, and their uncertainties, are such \n     as to nullify completely the reliability of any of the \n     climate models.\n\n  Earlier this year, the director of the International Arctic Research \nCenter in Fairbanks, AK, testified to Congress that highly publicized \nclimate models showing a disappearing Arctic were nothing more than \n``science fiction.''\n  That is not Senator Inhofe talking. That is the director of the \nInternational Arctic Research Center in Fairbanks, who ought to know a \nlittle bit about the Arctic.\n  In fact, after years of hearing about the computer-generated scary \nscenarios about the future of our planet, I now believe that the \ngreatest climate threat we face may be coming from alarmist computer \nmodels.\n  This threat is originating from the software installed on hard drives \nof the publicity-seeking climate modelers. It is long past time for us \nto separate climate change fact from hysteria.\n  One final point--and there are many. We have made seven talks, \naveraging about an hour apiece, about the flawed science. One final \npoint about the science: I am approached by many in the media and \nothers who ask: What if you are wrong, Inhofe, to doubt the dire global \nwarming predictions? Will you be able to live with yourself for \nopposing the Kyoto Protocol?\n\n  My answer is blunt. The history of the modern environmental movement \nis chock full of predictions of doom that never came true. We have all \nheard the dire predictions about the threat of overpopulation, resource \nscarcity, mass starvation, and the projected death of our oceans. None \nof them came true. Yet it never stopped the doomsayers from predicting \na dire environmental future.\n  The more the eco-doomsayers' predictions fail, the more the eco-\ndoomsayers predict. These failed predictions are just one reason I \nrespect the serious scientists out there today debunking the latest \nscare mongering on climate change: scientists such as MIT's Richard \nLindzen; former Colorado State climatologist, Roger Pielke, Sr.; the \nUniversity of Alabama's Roy Spencer and John Christy; Virginia State \nclimatologist Patrick Michaels; Colorado State University's William \nGray; atmospheric physicist, S. Fred Singer; Willie Soon of the \nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; Oregon State climatologist \nGeorge Taylor; astrophysicist Sallie Baliunas, to name a few.\n  You never hear about these well-established scientists.\n  More important, it is the global warming alarmists who should ask the \nquestion: What if they are correct about manmade catastrophic global \nwarming? They have come up with no meaningful solution to their \nsupposed climate crisis in the two decades they have been hyping this \nissue.\n  If the alarmists truly believe that manmade greenhouse gas emissions \nare dooming the planet, then they must face up to the fact that \nsymbolism does not solve a supposed climate crisis.\n  It is long past time for them to separate symbolism from fact. Let me \nshow you this. This is a chart I used on the floor before. A very \nprominent Senator from the Northeast who bought into this hoax called \nglobal warming--after he researched this chart, found it was true. This \nchart says in the event that everything is true that they have said \nabout global warming, and if all of the countries--I am talking about \nthe developing nations, as well as the developed nations--adhere to or \nachieve Kyoto goals, this is the difference it would make by 2050. It \nis not even measurable.\n  A final point on the science of climate change. Again, I am \napproached by many in the media and others who ask what if you are \nwrong? I think the answer is that they have been wrong all along.\n  The alarmists freely concede that the Kyoto Protocol, even if fully \nratified and complied with, would not have any meaningful impact on \nglobal temperatures. Keep in mind that Kyoto is not even close to being \ncomplied with by many of the ratifying nations. Fifteen European \nnations ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and 13 have not made their goals. \nSo they are not going to be able to do it.\n  Many of the nations that ratified Kyoto are now realizing what I have \nbeen saying all along: The Kyoto Protocol is a lot of economic pain for \nno climate gain.\n  Legislation that has been proposed in this Chamber would have even \nless of a temperature effect than Kyoto's undetectable impact. And more \nrecently, global warming alarmists and the media have been praising \nCalifornia for taking action to limit CO2. But here again \nthis costly, feel-good, California measure, which is actually far less \nsevere than Kyoto, will have no impact on the climate, only the \neconomy.\n  Symbolism does not solve a climate crisis.\n  In addition, we now have many environmentalists and Hollywood \ncelebrities, such as Laurie David, who have been advocating measures \nlike changing standard light bulbs in your home to fluorescents to help \navert global warming. Changing to more energy-efficient light bulbs is \nfine, but to somehow imply that we can avert a climate disaster by \nthese actions is absurd.\n  Once again, symbolism does not solve a climate crisis. But this \nsymbolism may be hiding a dark side. While greenhouse gas limiting \nproposals may cost the industrialized West trillions of dollars, it is \nthe effect on the developing world's poor that is being lost in this \ndebate.\n  The Kyoto Protocol's post-2012 agenda, which mandates that the \ndeveloping world be subjected to restrictions on greenhouse gases, \ncould have the potential to severely restrict development in regions \nsuch as Africa, Asia, and South America, where some of the Earth's most \nenergy-deprived people currently reside.\n  Expanding basic necessities like running water and electricity in the \ndeveloping world are seen by many in the Green Movement as a threat to \nthe planet's health that must be avoided.\n  Energy poverty equals a life of back-breaking poverty and premature \ndeath.\n  If we allow scientifically unfounded fears of global warming to \ninfluence policymakers to restrict future energy production and the \ncreation of basic infrastructure in the developing world, billions of \npeople will continue to suffer.\n  Last week, my committee heard testimony from Danish statistician \nBjorn Lomborg, who was once a committed leftwing environmentalist until \nhe realized that so much of what that the movement preached was based \non bad science. Lomborg wrote a book called ``The Skeptical \nEnvironmentalist'' and has organized some of the world's top Nobel \nlaureates to form the 2004 ``Copenhagen Consensus,'' which ranked the \nworld's most pressing problems.\n  Guess what. They place global warming at the bottom of the list in \nterms of our planet's priorities. The ``Copenhagen Consensus'' found \nthat the most important priorities for our planet include combating \ndisease, stopping malaria, securing clean water, and building \ninfrastructure to help lift the developing nations out of poverty.\n  I have made a lot of trips to Africa. A lot of people know I have had \na mission there for well over 10 years now. Once you see the \ndevastating poverty--we think we have poverty in this country. Well, if \nyou saw their poverty and the kids running through the junk piles and \nrats biting at the heels of their bloody feet, you would realize that \nthese fears about global warming are severely misguided.\n  I firmly believe that when the history of our era is written, future \ngenerations will look back with puzzlement and wonder why we spent so \nmuch time and effort on global warming fears and pointless solutions, \nsuch as the Kyoto protocol.\n  One of your favorite Frenchmen, Mr. President, Jacques Chirac, the \nFrench President, provided the key clue as to why so many in the \ninternational community still revere the Kyoto Protocol, when in 2000 \nhe said Kyoto represents not climate change but represents ``the first \ncomponent of an authentic global governance.''\n  Furthermore, if your goal is to limit CO2 emissions, the \nonly effective way to go about it is the use of cleaner, more effective \ntechnologies that will meet the energy demands of this century and \nbeyond.\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\n  The Bush administration and my Environment and Public Works \nCommittee--the committee I chair--have been engaged in these efforts as \nwe work to expand nuclear power and promote the Asian-Pacific \nPartnership. This partnership stresses the sharing of new technology \namong member nations, including three of the world's top 10 emitters--\nChina, India, and Korea--all of whom are exempt from Kyoto.\n  Keep in mind, even if all these charts were true and everyone is \ngoing to comply with this, we passed in this Chamber just a very short \nwhile ago, by a unanimous vote, 96 to 0, legislation that said if you \ncome back with any kind of treaty where we are going to treat \ndeveloping nations differently from developed nations, we are going to \noppose it. So it is unanimously opposed.\n  Many in the media, as I noted earlier, have taken it upon themselves \nto drop all pretense of balance on global warming and have instead \nbecome committed advocates for the issue.\n  Here is a quote from Newsweek. You have to listen to this, Mr. \nPresident. This is very important. I am going to quiz you later. This \nis a quote from Newsweek magazine:\n\n       There are numerous signs that the Earth's weather patterns \n     have begun to change dramatically and that these changes may \n     portend a drastic decline in food production--with serious \n     political implications for just about every nation on Earth.\n\n  A headline in the New York Times reads:\n\n       Climate Changes Endanger World's Food Output.\n\n  Here is another quote from Time magazine:\n\n       As they review the bizarre and unpredictable weather \n     pattern of the past several years, a growing number of \n     scientists are beginning to suspect that many seemingly \n     contradictory meteorological fluctuations are actually part \n     of a global climate upheaval.\n\n  All this sounds very ominous. That is until one realizes that the \nthree quotes I just read are from articles in 1975 editions of Newsweek \nmagazine and the New York Times, and Time magazine in 1974. They were \nnot referring to global warming; they were warning of a coming ice age. \nThe same people who were hysterical back then are using the same words \nto describe what is happening today.\n  Let me repeat: All three of those quotes were published in the 1970s \nwarning of a coming ice age. An ice age is coming; we are all going to \ndie.\n  In addition to global cooling fears, Time magazine has also reported \non global warming. Here is an example:\n\n       [Those] who claim that winters were harder when they were \n     boys are quite right . . . weathermen have no doubt that the \n     world at least for the time being is growing warmer.\n\n  Before one thinks that this is just another example of the media \npromoting former Vice President Gore's movie, one needs to know that \nthe quote I just read is from Time magazine and not a recent quote. It \nis from January 22, 1939. Yes, in 1939--9 years before former Vice \nPresident Gore was born and over three decades before Time magazine \nbegan hyping a coming ice age, and almost five decades before they \nreturned to hyping global warming.\n  Time magazine, in 1951, pointed to receding permafrost in Russia as \nproof that the planet was warming.\n  In 1952, the New York Times noted that the ``trump card'' of global \nwarming ``has been the melting glaciers.''\n  But the media could not decide between warming or cooling scares. \nThere are many more examples of the media and scientists flip-flopping \nbetween warming and cooling scares. They don't really care. They just \nwant to scare you. They want to make sure you are scared, and then they \nare satisfied.\n  Here is a quote from the New York Times on fears of an approaching \nice age:\n\n       Geologists Think the World May be Frozen Up Again.\n\n  That sentence appeared over 100 years ago in the February 24, 1895, \nedition of the New York Times. Let me repeat, 1895, not 1995.\n  A front-page article in the October 7, 1912, New York Times, just a \nfew months after the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank, declared that \na prominent professor ``Warns Us of an Encroaching Ice Age.''\n  The very same day in 1912, the Los Angeles Times ran an article \nwarning that the ``human race will have to fight for its existence \nagainst the cold.''\n  An August 10, 1923, Washington Post article declared:\n\n       Ice Age Coming Here.\n\n  By the 1930s, the media took a break from reporting on the coming ice \nage and instead switched gears to promoting global warming. This is the \n1930s:\n\n       America in Longest Warm Spell Since 1776; Temperature Line \n     Records a 25-year Rise.\n\n  That was in an article in the New York Times on March 27, 1933.\n  The media of yesteryear was also not above injecting large amounts of \nfear and alarmism into their climate articles.\n  An August 9, 1923, front-page article in the Chicago Tribune \ndeclared:\n\n       Scientist Says Arctic Ice Will Wipe Out Canada.\n\n  The article quoted a Yale University professor who predicted that \nlarge parts of Europe and Asia would be ``wiped out'' and Switzerland \nwould be ``entirely obliterated.''\n  A December 29, 1974, New York Times article on global cooling \nreported that climatologists believed ``the facts of the present \nclimate change are such that the most optimistic experts would assign \nnear certainty to major crop failure in a decade.''\n  The article also warned that unless Government officials reacted to \nthe coming catastrophe ``mass deaths by starvation and probably in \nanarchy and violence'' would result. In 1975, the New York Times \nreported that ``a major cooling [was] widely considered to be \ninevitable.''\n  These past predictions of doom have a familiar ring, don't they? They \nsound strikingly similar to our modern media promotion of the former \nVice President's brand of climate alarmism, an alarmism he believes \nwill put him back in the White House.\n  After more than a century of alternating between global cooling and \nwarming, one would think that this media history would serve a \ncautionary tale for today's voices in the media and scientific \ncommunity who are promoting yet another round of eco-doom.\n  Much of the 100-year media history on climate change that I have \ndocumented today can be found in a publication entitled ``Fire and \nIce'' from the Business and Media Institute.\n  Which raises the question: How has this embarrassing 100-year \ndocumented legacy of coverage on what turned out to be trendy climate \nscience theories made the media more skeptical of today's sensational \npromoters of global warming? You be the judge.\n  On February 19 of this year, CBS News's ``60 Minutes'' produced a \nsegment on the North Pole. The segment was a completely one-sided \nreport alleging rapid and unprecedented melting at the polar cap. It \neven featured correspondent Scott Pelley claiming that the ice in \nGreenland was melting so fast that he barely got off an iceberg before \nit collapsed into the water.\n  Mr. President, ``60 Minutes'' failed to inform its viewers that a \n2005 study by a scientist named Ola Johannessen and his colleagues \nshowed that the interior of Greenland is gaining ice mass and that, \naccording to scientists, the Arctic was warmer in the 1930s than it is \ntoday. If you see this film, they will say it is the warmest it has \never been. It is just not true.\n  By the way, around the edges of ice caps there is a phenomenon known \nas calving. So when it becomes thicker in the middle, it melts a little \non the outside, but the overall volume density increases.\n  On March 19 of this year, ``60 Minutes'' profiled NASA scientists and \nalarmist James Hansen who was once again making allegations of being \ncensored by the Bush administration. In this segment, objectivity and \nbalance were again tossed aside in favor of a one-sided glowing profile \nof Hansen.\n  The ``60 Minutes'' segment made no mention of Hansen's partisan ties \nto former Democratic Vice President Al Gore or Hansen's receiving of a \ngrant of a quarter of a million dollars from the leftwing Heinz \nFoundation run by Teresa Heinz Kerry. I guess she is Teresa Heinz now. \nThere was also no mention of Hansen's subsequent endorsement of her \nhusband John Kerry for the presidency in 2004. He is a political \nactivist. This was never mentioned in the ``60 Minutes'' segment.\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\n  Many in the media dwell on any industry support given to so-called \nclimate skeptics, but the same media completely failed to note Hansen's \nhuge grant from the leftwing Heinz Foundation.\n  The foundation's money originated from the Heinz family ketchup \nfortune. So it appears that the media makes a distinction between oil \nmoney and ketchup money.\n  Mr. President, ``60 Minutes'' also did not inform viewers that Hansen \nappeared to concede in a 2003 issue of ``Natural Science'' that the use \nof ``extreme scenarios'' to dramatize climate change ``may have been \nappropriate one time'' to drive the public's attention on the issue. In \nother words, it is all right to lie in order to drive the public's \nattention to an issue that you want them to have and to that opinion.\n  Why would ``60 Minutes'' ignore the basic tenets of journalism that \ncall for objectivity and balance in sourcing and do such one-sided \nsegments?\n  The answer was provided by correspondent Scott Pelley. Pelley told \nthe CBS News Web site that he justified excluding scientists skeptical \nof global warming alarmism from his segments because he considers \nskeptics to be the equivalent of ``Holocaust deniers.''\n  This year also saw a New York Times reporter write a children's book \nentitled ``The North Pole Was Here.'' The author of the book, New York \nTimes reporter Andrew Revkin, wrote that it may someday be ``easier to \nsail to than stand on'' the North Pole in summer. So here we have a \nvery prominent environmental reporter for the New York Times who is \npromoting the aspect of global warming alarmism in a book aimed at our \nkids.\n  In April of this year, Time magazine devoted an issue to global \nwarming alarmism entitled ``Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid.'' This is the \nsame Time magazine which first warned of a coming ice age in the 1920s \nbefore it switched to warning about global warming in the 1930s, before \nit switched again to promoting the 1970s coming ice age scare. The \nApril 3, 2006, global warming special report of Time magazine was a \nprime example of the media's shortcomings, as the magazine cited \npartisan leftwing environmental groups with a vested financial interest \nin hyping alarmism.\n  Headlines blared: ``More and More Land is Being Devastated by \nDrought.''\n  ``Earth is at the Tipping Point.''\n  ``The Climate is Crashing.''\n  Time magazine did not make the slightest attempt to balance its \nreporting with any views of scientists skeptical of this alleged \nclimate disaster.\n  I don't have journalism training, but I daresay calling a bunch of \nenvironmental groups with an obvious fundraising agenda and asking them \nto make wild speculations on how bad global warming might become is \nnothing more than advocacy for leftwing causes. It is a violation of \nbasic journalistic standards.\n  To his credit, New York Times reporter Revkin saw fit to criticize \nTime magazine for its embarrassing coverage of climate science.\n  So in the end, Time's cover story title of ``Be Worried, Be Very \nWorried'' appears to have been apt. The American people should be \nworried--they should be very worried--of such shoddy journalism.\n  As to Al Gore's inconvenient truth, in May, our Nation was exposed to \nperhaps one of the slickest science propaganda films of all time. \nFormer Vice President Gore's ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' in addition to \nhaving the backing of Paramount Pictures to market this film, had the \nfull backing of the media, and leading the cheerleading charge was none \nother than the Associated Press, and of course they had the elitists, \nfrom Hollywood.\n  On June 27, the Associated Press ran an article by Seth Borenstein \nthat boldly declared:\n\n       ``Scientists give two thumbs up to Gore's movie.''\n\n  The article quoted only five scientists--two thumbs up, five \nscientists. They were praising Gore's science, despite the Associated \nPress having contacted over 100 scientists.\n  The fact that over 80 percent of the scientists contacted by the AP \nhad not even seen the movie or that many scientists have harshly \ncriticized the science presented by Gore did not dissuade the news \noutlet one bit from its mission to promote Gore's brand of climate \nalarmism.\n  Let's keep in mind, they said it is thumbs up, 100 percent of the \nscientists, and it was only 5 out of the 100.\n  I am almost at a loss as to how to begin to address the series of \nerrors, misleading science, and unfounded speculation that appear in \nthe former Vice President's film and in his book of the same name.\n  Here is what Richard Lindzen, a meteorologist from MIT, has written \nabout ``An Inconvenient Truth.'' He is talking about Al Gore and his \nmovie. This is a scientist, Richard Lindzen, a meteorologist from MIT:\n\n       A general characteristic of Mr. Gore's approach is to \n     ignore the fact that the Earth and its climate are dynamic; \n     they are always changing even without any external forcing. \n     To treat all change as something to fear is bad enough; to do \n     so in order to exploit that fear is much worse.\n\n  That is exactly what Al Gore is doing.\n  What follows is a brief summary of the science the former Vice \nPresident promotes in either a wrong or misleading way:\n  He promoted the now debunked ``hockey stick'' temperature chart in an \nattempt to prove man's overwhelming impact on the climate.\n  He attempted to minimize the significance of the medieval warm period \nand the little ice age.\n  He insists on a link between increased hurricane activity and global \nwarming that most scientists believe does not exist.\n  He asserted that today's Arctic is experiencing unprecedented warmth \nwhile ignoring that temperatures in the 1930s were as warm or warmer \nthan they are today.\n  He claimed the Antarctic is warming and losing ice but failed to note \nthat is only true of a small region and the vast bulk has been cooling \nand gaining ice. This is the Antarctic.\n  He hyped unfounded fears that Greenland's ice is in danger of \ndisappearing.\n  He erroneously claimed that the icecap on Mount Kilimanjaro is \ndisappearing because of global warming, even while the region cools and \nresearchers blame ice loss on local land-use practices. What they are \ntalking about here is they had deforested the area down below. That was \nthe reason. It had nothing to do with CO2, obviously.\n  He made assertions of massive future sea level rise that is way \noutside of any supposed scientific consensus and is not supported in \neven the most alarmist literature.\n  He incorrectly implied that a Peruvian glacier's retreat is due to \nglobal warming, while ignoring the fact that the region has been \ncooling since the 1930s and other glaciers in South America are \nadvancing.\n  He blamed global warming for water loss in Africa's Lake Chad despite \nNASA scientists concluding that local population and grazing factors \nare the more likely culprits.\n  He inaccurately claimed polar bears are drowning in significant \nnumbers due to melting ice when in fact they are thriving.\n  He completely failed to inform viewers that the 48 scientists who \naccused President Bush of distorting science were part of a political \nadvocacy group set up to support the Democratic Presidential candidate \nJohn Kerry in 2004.\n  That was just a brief sampling of some of the errors presented in \n``An Inconvenient Truth.'' Imagine how long the list would have been if \nI had actually seen the movie. There wouldn't be enough time to deliver \nthe speech today.\n  So along comes Tom Brokaw. Following the promotion of ``An \nInconvenient Truth,'' the press did not miss a beat in their role as \nadvocates for global warming fears.\n  ABC News put forth its best effort to secure its standing as an \nadvocate for climate alarmism when the network put out a call for \npeople to submit their anecdotal global warming horror stories in June \nfor use in a future news segment.\n  In July, the Discovery Channel presented a documentary on global \nwarming narrated by former NBC anchor Tom Brokaw. The program presented \nonly those views of scientists promoting the idea that humans are \ndestroying the Earth's climate. You don't have to take my word for the \nprogram's overwhelming bias. A Bloomberg TV news review noted:\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\n``You'll find more dissent at a North Korean political rally than in \nthis program'' because of its lack of scientific objectivity.\n  Brokaw also presented climate alarmist James Hansen to viewers as \nunbiased, failing to note his quarter-million-dollar grant from the \npartisan Heinz Foundation or his endorsement of Democratic Presidential \nnominee John Kerry in 2004 and his role promoting former Vice President \nGore's Hollywood movie. Brokaw, however, did find time to impugn the \nmotives of scientists skeptical of climate alarmism when he featured \npaid environmental partisan Michael Oppenhimer, of the group \nEnvironmental Defense, accusing skeptics of being bought out by fossil \nfuel interests.\n  The fact remains that political campaign funding by environmental \ngroups to promote climate and environmental alarmism dwarfs spending by \nthe fossil fuel industry by 3 to 1. Environmental special interests, \nthrough their 527s, spent over $19 million compared to $7 million spent \nby the oil and gas industry through political action committees in the \n2004 election cycle.\n  I am reminded of a question the media often asks me about how much I \nhave received in campaign contributions from the fossil fuel industry. \nMy unapologetic answer is always: Not enough, especially when you \nconsider the millions partisan environmental groups pour into political \ncampaigns.\n  Continuing with our media analysis: On July 24, 2006, the Los Angeles \nTimes featured an op-ed by Naomi Oreskes, a social scientist at the \nUniversity of California, San Diego, and the author of a 2004 Science \nmagazine study. Oreskes insisted that a review of 928 scientific papers \nshowed there was 100 percent consensus that global warming was not \ncaused by natural climate variations. This study was also featured in \nformer Vice President Al Gore's ``An Inconvenient Truth.''\n  However, the analysis in Science magazine excluded nearly 11,000 \nstudies or more than 90 percent of the papers dealing with global \nwarming, according to a critique by British social scientist Benny \nPeiser. Peiser also pointed out that less than 2 percent of the climate \nstudies in the survey actually endorsed the so-called ``consensus \nview'' that human activity is driving global warming and some of the \nstudies actually opposed that view. Oreskes called 2 percent, 100 \npercent. But despite this manufactured ``consensus,'' the media \ncontinued to ignore any attempt to question the orthodoxy of climate \nalarmism.\n  As the dog days of August rolled in, the American people were once \nagain hit with more hot hype regarding global warming, this time from \nthe New York Times op-ed pages. A columnist penned an August 3 column \nfilled with so many inaccuracies it is a wonder the editor of the Times \nsaw fit to publish it. For instance, Bob Herbert's column made dubious \nclaims about polar bears, the snows of Kilimanjaro, and he attempted to \nlink this past summer's heat wave in the United States to global \nwarming--something even the alarmist James Hansen does not support.\n  Finally, a September 15, 2006, Reuters News article claimed that \npolar bears in the Arctic are threatened with extinction by global \nwarming. The article by correspondent Alister Doyle quoted a visitor to \nthe Arctic--now listen to this, Mr. President--a visitor to the Arctic \nwho claimed he saw two distressed polar bears. According to the Reuters \narticle, the man noted that one of the polar bears looked to be dead \nand the other one looked to be exhausted. The article did not state the \nbears were actually dead or exhausted, they merely looked that way. \nHave we really arrived at the point where major news outlets in the \nUnited States are reduced to analyzing whether polar bears in the \nArctic appear restful? How reporting such as this gets approved for \npublication by the editors at Reuters, I don't know. What happened to \ncovering the hard science in this issue?\n  What was missing from the Reuters News article was the fact that \naccording to biologists who study animals, polar bears are doing quite \nwell. Biologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor from the Arctic government of \nNunavut, which is a territory of Canada, refuted these claims in May \nwhen he noted that--this is a quote. Keep in mind I am quoting the \nbiologist Dr. Mitchell Taylor from the Arctic government. He said:\n\n       Of the 13 populations of polar bears in Canada, 11 are \n     stable or increasing in number. They are not going extinct, \n     or even appear to be affected at present.\n\n  Sadly, it appears that reporting anecdotes and hearsay is now fast \nreplacing the tenets of journalism for many media outlets.\n  It is an inconvenient truth that so far 2006 has been a year in which \nmost major segments of the media have given up on any quest for \njournalistic balance, fairness, and objectivity when it comes to \nclimate change. The global warming alarmists and their friends in the \nmedia have attempted to smear scientists who dare to question the \npremise of manmade catastrophic global warming, and as a result some \nscientists have seen their reputations and their research funding dry \nup.\n  The media has so relentlessly promoted global warming fears that a \nBritish group called the Institute For Public Policy Research--and this \nfrom a left-leaning group--issued a report in 2006 accusing media \noutlets of engaging in what they termed ``climate porn'' in order to \nattract the public's attention. Bob Carter, a paleoclimate geologist \nfrom James Cook University in Australia, has described how the media \npromotes this kind of fear:\n\n       Each such alarmist article is larded with words such as \n     ``if,'' ``might,'' ``could,'' ``probably,'' ``perhaps,'' \n     ``expected,'' ``projected,'' or ``modeled,'' and many involve \n     such deep dreaming, or ignorance of scientific facts or \n     principles, that they are akin to nonsense.\n\n  He concluded this in an op-ed in April of this year.\n  Another example of this relentless hype is the reporting on the \nseemingly endless number of global warming impact studies which do not \neven address whether global warming is going to happen. They merely \nproject the impact of potential temperature increases.\n  The media endlessly hypes studies that purportedly show that global \nwarming could increase mosquito populations, malaria, West Nile virus, \nheat waves and hurricanes, threaten the oceans, damage coral reefs, \nboost poison ivy growth, damage vineyards and global food crops, to \nname just a few of the global warming-linked calamities. Oddly, \naccording to the media reports, warmer temperatures almost never seem \nto have any positive effects on plant or animal life or food \nproduction.\n  Fortunately, the media's addiction to so-called ``climate porn'' has \nfailed to seduce many Americans. According to a July Pew Research \nCenter poll, the American public is split about evenly between those \nwho say global warming is due to human activity versus those who \nbelieve it is from natural factors or not happening at all. This is \nsignificantly down from the previous polls. In addition, an August Los \nAngeles Times/Bloomberg poll found that most Americans do not attribute \nthe cause of recent severe weather events to global warming, and the \nportion of Americans who believe global warming is naturally occurring \nis on the rise. It is nothing short of a miracle and amazing that the \nAmerican people are not buying this alarmism. It is all they see on TV. \nIt is all they hear about. I would rather believe the American people \nknow when their intelligence is being insulted and they know when they \nare being used and when they are being duped by the hysterical left.\n  The American people deserve much better from our fourth estate. We \nhave a right to expect accuracy and objectivity on climate change \ncoverage. We have a right to expect balance in sourcing and fair \nanalysis from reporters who cover the issue. Above all, the media must \nroll back this mantra that there is scientific ``consensus'' of \nimpending climatic doom as an excuse to ignore recent science. I used \nto get this all the time from the left. They say: Well, the consensus \nis already there; we don't want to talk about science. No wonder they \ndon't--because most of the science since 1999 has refuted everything \nthey are asserting. After all, there was a so-called scientific \nconsensus that there were nine planets in our solar system until Pluto \nwas recently demoted.\n  I am a realist. I want to challenge the news media to reverse course \nand report on the objective science of climate change, stop ignoring \nlegitimate voices in this scientific debate, and\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\nstop being used by the hysterical left. Breaking the cycles of media \nhysteria will not be easy since hysteria sells and it is very \nprofitable, but I really believe the issue is getting worn out. They \nhave not been able to come up with anything to support their side. And \nas Winston Churchill said:\n\n       The truth is incontrovertible. Panic may resent it, \n     ignorance may deride it, malice may destroy it, but there it \n     is. And it will be there, and we will understand.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coleman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I ask that I be recognized to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10062-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10062-S10063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nto talk about the importance of immigration reform in a comprehensive \nmanner. We are in the last week of this legislative session before the \nNovember elections. It is obvious to me, in terms of what is going on \nin the country, that the leadership of the Senate, the Congress, and \nthe White House has decided to allow politics to triumph over the very \nfundamental national purposes for which we have tried to work together \nwith respect to comprehensive immigration reform.\n  It is my hope that those speaking for principled immigration reform \nstand up and say that we are not going to let politics triumph over \nnational security, that we are not going to let politics triumph over \nthe rule of law, which is a central tenet of our Nation, basic to the \nstability of our Nation, and that we are not going to let politics \ntriumph over the economic and human and moral realities with which we \ndeal in immigration.\n  As we move forward in the days ahead, dealing with this fence \nlegislation, legislation that would create a fence across Arizona and \nTexas and Mexico and the possibility of a fence between the United \nStates and Canada, I hope the voices of reason that brought Republicans \nand Democrats together on the floor of this Senate to say we needed \ncomprehensive immigration reform, once again will say we reject \npiecemeal legislation that deals with creating a fence only because we \nknow that will not be the answer for the comprehensive immigration \nreform we need.\n  When I look at the map which has come out of the House of \nRepresentatives which would create a fence which would essentially \nfollow the entire border of Arizona and large pieces of the Texas \nborder, it seems to me what we are doing here in Washington is we are \ntelling those States that we know better here in Washington where the \nfence ought to be located and we will authorize this fence to be built \nonly in these particulars locations. We are, in fact, not listening to \nthe Department of Homeland Security and to our Border Patrol officers \nwho know there are places where it is appropriate for us to put a \nfence. Indeed, in our legislation here in the Senate, what we did is we \nauthorized the construction of a fence, but we also recognized there \nwas latitude to be given to those experts who are in charge of making \nsure we create a secure border.\n  When I look at what we are trying to do in this debate which will \ntake place with respect to the Secure Fence Act on the floor this year, \nI would like us to look back and see what was being said around the \ncountry with respect to immigration reform just a few months ago when \nwe were debating immigration reform here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Our Secretary of Homeland Security, Secretary Chertoff, said this \nabout the fence:\n\n       Fencing has its place in some areas, but as a total \n     solution, I don't think it's a good solution.\n\n  Secretary Chertoff, on February 9, 2006, also said the following:\n\n       When you're dealing with the desert, for example, we don't \n     advocate putting a fence in the desert because it's more \n     efficient for us to intercept people when they're in the \n     desert at a place of our own choosing as opposed to being \n     forced to guard the entire fence, right up against the fence.\n\n  From our friend, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, speaking about \nthe fence, back in those days: ``I think that's contrary to our \ntraditions,'' he said, noting that ``99.9 percent'' of illegal \nimmigrants ``come across to seek a better life for their families. . . \n.'' This is from Attorney General Gonzales.\n  He continued and said:\n\n       I don't know if that would make much sense. We've got a \n     2,000-mile border. Because of natural geography, we don't \n     need a fence . . . along certain portions of that border. \n     Obviously, we believe it does make sense to have fencing \n     along certain areas of our border. We do have several hundred \n     miles of fencing currently, but the objective here is to make \n     sure we're being smart in securing our border.\n\n  Commissioner W. Ralph Basham from Customs and Border Protection said:\n  It doesn't make sense, it's not practical.\n  We are in the last week of the legislative session, doing our \nbusiness prior to the time we go out for elections. So what has \nhappened here? What has happened here is people have decided to ride \nthis horse of immigration reform, with all the divisiveness it has \ncreated around the country, to try to gain a political advantage in \nthese November elections. It would be my hope that Democrats and \nRepublicans of this body, who stood with the President in calling for \ncomprehensive immigration reform, would stand by those principles and \nsay: We are going to push forward for immigration reform that really \nworks for our country because it addresses all aspects of the \nimmigration issue we face in America.\n  We as a Senate did that several months ago. I was very proud to have \nworked with people such as Senator McCain, Senator Graham, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Kennedy, and a whole host of other people who were \ninvolved in putting together what became a comprehensive immigration \nreform package. It was a law-and-order bill that we debated here on the \nfloor for weeks and was ultimately adopted by a significant bipartisan \ngroup of Senators. It was a law-and-order bill because it dealt in a \ncomprehensive way with the issue of immigration. It dealt in a \ncomprehensive way with the recognition that we have a national security \ncrisis on our hands that requires us to deal with immigration reform in \na comprehensive way.\n  The components of the legislative which we subsequently shepherded \nthrough the Senate included border security, strengthening our border. \nIt included immigration law enforcement so we make sure that we as a \nnation uphold our tradition of being a nation of laws; that we enforce \nour immigration laws here in our country.\n  It also includes huge registration penalties applying against those \nwho have broken the law and have come to this country illegally.\n  The law and order bill deserves the support of the Senate. It is my \nhope as we move forward in the debate on immigration this week that we \nreturn to that legislation and move that legislation as an amendment to \nthe legislation which has been introduced in this body.\n  Let me again quickly walk through to refresh my colleagues' memory \nabout the components of this legislation which we felt so urgently was \nneeded to deal with national security and the economic and human \nreality relating to the immigration issue.\n  First, we all want our borders secure. We recognize we can't have a \nsecure nation if we can't deal with the threats we face with homeland \nsecurity unless we secure the border. We recognize the United States of \nAmerica as a sovereign nation has a sovereign right to protect its \nborders. We need to make sure we are protecting our borders.\n  We included in our legislation many aspects of a cross-border \nsecurity solution. They included 12,000 new Border Patrol agents which \nwe would add to our Border Patrol effort to make sure we have the right \nmanpower to address the border security issue.\n  In that legislation through an amendment that was sponsored by our \nfriend from Alabama, we created additional fences that would be \nestablished along the border, some 370 miles of\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nfences that had been established and constructed in critical locations \nalong the border.\n  We provided new criminal penalties for construction of border tunnels \nto address what has happened in places where there are currently fences \nacross borders; where people have created tunnels to dig under those \nfences to come to the United States. We added new checkpoints and \npoints of entry throughout the entire border. We expanded the exit-\nentry security system at all land borders and airports.\n  Our legislation dealt in a comprehensive way moving forward to make \nsure we were creating a secure border. That was a key component of \nlegislation we are dealing with.\n  Beyond securing our borders, which is very essential as we put \ntogether this effort on comprehensive immigration reform, we also \nrecognized that we as a nation must enforce our immigration laws. So we \nincluded in our legislation significant provisions to ensure we are \nenforcing those laws.\n  We added 5,000 new investigators to help us enforce our laws. We \nestablished in that legislation 20 new detention facilities so we can \neffectively process those who are caught here in our country illegally. \nWe included provisions in our legislation that would reimburse States \nfor detaining and imprisoning criminal aliens. That is an issue which \nhas affected local and State governments throughout our country.\n  We included in our legislation requirements for a faster deportation \nprocess. We increased penalties for gang members, for money laundering, \nand human trafficking. We increased document fraud detection, and we \ncreated new fraudproof immigration documents for people who are here in \nthis country with biometric identifiers.\n  Finally, we expanded authority to remove suspected terrorists from \nour country.\n  Looking at what we did in coming up with an immigration enforcement \npackage in our country, we said we were going to ensure that we as a \nnation of laws would have a legal system in place that would in fact be \nenforceable and that we would put the resources behind that \nenforcement.\n  We also dealt with another issue; that is, an issue that has caused \nso much controversy around this country. Essentially, it had to do with \nthe question what do you do with 11 million or 12 million human beings \ncurrently residing in our country. We felt as a group of Democrats and \nRepublicans working on this legislation that we needed to come up with \na realistic and humane way of approaching the 12 million people who are \nhere illegally in our country. These are the people who probably have \ncleaned the hotel rooms and motel rooms where most Americans stay. \nThese are the people who are working at construction sites in each one \nof the our States around the country. These are the people who are the \nbackbone of the agricultural workforce in places such as Idaho, \nColorado, and throughout our great Nation.\n  So we decided to come up with a program where we would deal with \nthese 12 million people in an honest, realistic, and straightforward \nmanner. We said we would require them to pay a fine. They have broken \nthe law. They will be punished. They have broken the law and they will \nbe punished by the requirements that they pay a fine for their illegal \nconduct. We require that they register with the U.S. Government. That \nis not a requirement for any U.S. citizen, but we require these people \nto step forward, to come out of the shadows and to register themselves \nwith the U.S. Government.\n  We require them to pay additional registration fees. We require them \nto learn English. We require them to learn American history and \ngovernment. We require them to pass medical exams. And we require them \nto be continuously employed with a valid temporary visa.\n  We came up with a program that the President himself has talked about \nin positive terms, where essentially we would bring these people to \ncome out of the shadows. We require them to go to the back of the line. \nWe require them to pay a penalty. We require them to learn English, and \nwe require them to learn about American history as a realistic way of \napproaching the reality of 12 million human beings who live here in our \ncountry today.\n  Let me come back and talk a little bit about the piecemeal approach--\nthis political approach which is being talked about here in the \nCongress today. It is in fact a piecemeal approach because all of those \nwho have studied this issue recognize that unless we deal with \nimmigration issues in a comprehensive way, it will not work. Many of us \nin this Chamber have had many conversations with the President of the \nUnited States about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. On \nAugust 3 of this year, in a public statement, the President said:\n\n       I'm going to talk today about comprehensive immigration \n     reform. I say comprehensive because unless you have all five \n     pieces working together it's not going to work at all.\n\n  This is the President of the United States saying it is not going to \nwork at all unless we do this in a comprehensive manner.\n  In another statement, he said the following:\n\n       We will fix the problems created by illegal immigration, \n     and we deliver a system that is secure, orderly, and fair. So \n     I support comprehensive immigration reform that will \n     accomplish these five objectives.\n\n  That was the President of our country.\n  He said in another statement on May 15 of 2006 the following:\n\n       Some in this country argue that the solution is to deport \n     every illegal immigrant, and that any proposal short of this \n     amounts to amnesty. I disagree. It is neither wise nor \n     realistic to round up millions of people, many with deep \n     roots in the United States, and send them across the border. \n     There is a rational middle ground.\n\n  That is from the President's Presidential address of May 15, 2006.\n  On May 15, on that same day, he said the following:\n\n       An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive, \n     because all elements of this problem must be addressed \n     together, or none of them will be solved at all. Congress can \n     pass a comprehensive bill for me to sign into law.\n\n  That is what the President of the United States has asked us as a \nCongress to do. That was what Democrats and Republicans in this Chamber \ncame together to do several months ago.\n  It would be my hope as we consider the legislation which we will be \ndebating this week that we take the statements of the President, the \nstatements that have been made by members of his administration, and \nstatements made here on the floor, and that we address this issue of \nimmigration reform in a manner that is truly going to work as opposed \nto addressing it in a piecemeal manner as has been suggested by the \nlegislation which we will be considering.\n  I conclude by asking my colleagues in the Senate today to make sure \nas we move forward to not let politics triumph over the national \nsecurity issue of the broken borders that we face today; that we as a \nSenate do not let politics triumph over the rule of law which makes us \nhave the kind of country we can all be very proud of because we abide \nby the rule of law; that we as a country make sure we stand up for the \nhuman and moral issues that are very much on stage in this debate over \nimmigration reform. Those issues should take precedence over a \npolitical agenda which is obviously unfolding with this legislation \nthat has been brought to the floor of the Senate today.\n  Finally, I ask the White House, President Bush, to end the silence on \nthis issue. President Bush has been working on this issue for a long \ntime. He is a former Governor of a border State. He knows what is at \nstake on this issue. I hope the White House can provide this body and \nthe House of Representatives with the kind of guidance they were \nproviding us when we were dealing with the issue some months ago.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time is allocated in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 37 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For each speaker, is there a time limitation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the Democratic side, 37 minutes remain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10063-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10063-S10064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GLOBAL TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, according to reports in Sunday's New\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nYork Times and Washington Post, a National Intelligence Estimate \nprepared last April concludes that the war in Iraq has made the problem \nof global terrorism worse and that terrorist cells have metastasized \nand spread across the globe.\n  For more than 3 years, President Bush and the Republican Congress \nhave repeatedly claimed the war in Iraq is making America safer. Now, \nwe learn that the 16 agencies in the intelligence community concluded \njust the opposite last April--that the Iraq war has become a rallying \ncry for extremists against the United States and made the war on terror \nmore difficult to win.\n  The American people have the right to hear from our Nation's top \nintelligence official about the conclusions of the intelligence \ncommunity in this report. Before Congress adjourns this week, Director \nof National Intelligence John Negroponte should testify in open session \nabout this report. In addition, an unclassified version of the key \njudgments and discussion about Iraq in the report should be made \navailable to the public in a way that protects sources and methods.\n  With more than 140,000 American troops on the ground in Iraq and \nterrorist attacks increasing around the globe, the stakes for the \nsafety of all Americans are enormously high. It is our obligation to \nhear directly from Mr. Negroponte before adjourning at the end of this \nweek. It is essential that Congress and the American people obtain a \nfuller understanding about the conclusions of the intelligence \ncommunity about the impact of the Iraq war.\n  In addition, the President and Vice President must explain statements \nthey have made that are directly at odds with this National \nIntelligence Estimate.\n  Despite the conclusion of the intelligence community that the war has \nbeen a recruitment tool for a new generation of extremists, on numerous \noccasions since the document was prepared, President Bush has claimed \nthat the war has made America safer.\n  On September 7, President Bush said:\n\n       We've learned the lessons of 9/11 * * * We've gone on the \n     offense against our enemies, and transformed former \n     adversaries into allies. We have put in place the \n     institutions needed to win this war. Five years after \n     September the 11th, 2001, America is safer--and America is \n     winning the war on terror.\n\n  On September 11, President Bush said:\n\n       Saddam's regime posed a risk that the world could not \n     afford to take. The world is safer because Saddam Hussein is \n     no longer in power.\n\n  Despite the conclusion of the intelligence community 5 months earlier \nthat new threats are emerging because of the war in Iraq, Vice \nPresident Cheney said the exact opposite on September 10. He said:\n\n       We are better off there because of what we've done to date. \n     We are less likely to have a threat emerge against the United \n     States from that corner of the world than would have been the \n     case if Saddam were still there.\n\n  The American people deserve to know whether the President and Vice \nPresident are intentionally misleading us about our safety or whether \nthey are simply ignoring the intelligence community. Clearly, America \ndeserves better from its leaders.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded. I ask to speak for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to speak for up to \n20 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10064-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10064-S10066]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TERRORIST TRIBUNALS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, one of the lessons America learned after \nthe tragic events of September 11, 2001, is the danger of treating our \nfight against global terrorism as a law enforcement function alone. \nThis was documented time and time again, whether it is the wall that \nwas erected that prevented intelligence authorities from getting access \nto important information and sharing it with law enforcement \nauthorities, and vice versa, or whether it was waiting until a \nterrorist attack occurred and then merely investigating in the rubble \nand the destruction left behind, and then prosecuting the person, if, \nin fact, he could be prosecuted and brought to justice.\n  It concerns me a great deal that we have seemed to lapse once again \ninto a pre-September 11 mindset where some of our colleagues, as we \ndebate the use of terrorist tribunals and the access to our court \nsystem those convicted of war crimes should have, seem to have \nforgotten some of those lessons learned from September 11. It is \nimportant we not fight this global war on terrorism strictly as a law \nenforcement matter, punishing conduct after the fact rather than \ngaining intelligence we need in order to detect, deter, and disrupt \nterrorist attacks from occurring in the first place. Specifically, I \nwill address what sort of avenues of appeal detainees at Guantanamo Bay \nshould have regarding their convictions and their status review.\n  Members may recall late last year the Congress passed something \ncalled the Detainee Treatment Act in which we thought we had dealt \ncomprehensively with the issue of how detainees, unlawful combatants, \nshould be treated. Of course, we reiterated our commitment, the ban \nagainst torture, cruel and inhumane and degrading conduct, but in that \nimportant piece of legislation, Congress also said that detainees, \nthese unlawful combatants, people who do not observe the laws of war, \nwho target innocent civilian populations, are not entitled to receive \nthe full panoply of rights accorded to American citizens when tried in \nan Article III court of law.\n  Specifically, we said that for the writ of habeas corpus that \notherwise might be available to them, we would substitute an \nalternative procedure composed of three different things. We created \nthe combat status review tribunal, first, which was designed to make \nsure the individuals who are actually detained at Guantanamo Bay were, \nin fact, enemy combatants, and to make sure we did not in the course of \nor in the fog of war sweep up innocent bystanders who were not actually \na threat to the United States. These combat status review tribunals \nhave very important procedures I will mention in a moment.\n  However, we also saw the use of administrative review boards that on \nan annual basis review the status of a particular detainee at \nGuantanamo Bay to determine, No. 1, whether they were a continuing \nthreat to the American people or our allies, and, No. 2, whether \nadditional actionable intelligence could be obtained from them during \nthe interrogation process.\n  This administrative review board is an annual process and has \nresulted in the release of many of the detainees who were at Guantanamo \nBay who had been determined to no longer be a danger to the American \npeople or our allies.\n  The fact is these two procedures--the combatant status review \ntribunal and the administrative review board--are coupled together with \nan additional right of appellate review provided under the Detainee \nTreatment Act which is full review of a conviction by a military \ncommission by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in the Nation's \ncapital. That court is not restricted in any way to review any and all \nerrors they believe are material to the outcome of the case, and I \nbelieve, combined with the combatant status review tribunal and the \nadministrative review board, does provide a due process for these \ndetainees in a way that does not jeopardize this legislation, should it \nbe ultimately reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Actually, I think it might surprise some of our colleagues to be \ntalking about this issue because they may well have thought we \naddressed this issue late last year when we passed the Detainee \nTreatment Act. The fact is, in the Hamden case, handed down in June, \nthe U.S. Supreme Court said Congress had not made sufficiently clear \nits intention to apply the Detainee Treatment Act to pending cases. \nTherefore, it went on to decide the Hamden case, refused to throw out \nthe appeal based on a lack of jurisdiction, and, in fact, left us with \na situation where about 300 of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay have \nabout 600 applications for writs of habeas corpus pending in American \ncourts.\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\n  The United States provides adequate evidentiary hearings to ensure \nthat detainees held at Guantanamo Bay are, in fact, unlawful \ncombatants, and, No. 2, pose a threat to the United States national \nsecurity interests. These detainee status hearings and other procedures \nprovided by the United States to terrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay \nmeet, and in many ways exceed, the requirements for prisoners of war \nunder article V of the Geneva Conventions.\n  As I mentioned, on top of these status hearings, meaningful judicial \nreview is provided by the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals. Final judicial \nreview is provided of those decisions. These status hearings and \njudicial review mechanisms were codified as part of that Detainee \nTreatment Act.\n  The District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals--which many in this \nChamber have referred to as the second highest court in the land--has \nthe power to review not only whether the Department of Defense \nfaithfully followed the procedures prescribed by Congress but also \nwhether those procedures comport with the U.S. Constitution.\n  For some to say, as I actually heard this morning in a hearing we had \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, that ``no meaningful judicial \nreview'' is provided to unlawful combatants is, I claim, inaccurate and \nmisleading.\n  While providing these judicial procedures, Congress saw fit to \nforeclose the possibility of a flood of habeas corpus petitions \noverwhelming the Federal courts and distracting our men and women in \nuniform from prosecuting the war effort. The status hearings and \njudicial review mechanisms are intended to satisfy the meaningful \nreview requirement in the absence of the ability to file a petition for \nwrit of habeas corpus. Alien enemy combatants, whether lawful or \nunlawful under the Geneva Conventions, have never been found by the \nU.S. Supreme Court to have a right to file a habeas corpus petition in \nAmerican Federal courts.\n  In 1950, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a case called Eisentrager v. \nJohnson that enemy combatants held by U.S. forces overseas are not \nentitled to the ``privilege of litigation'' and cannot sue our military \nin our courts.\n  Beyond the constitutional arguments for removing habeas jurisdiction, \nthere are important practical considerations, as well, as explained in \nthe Eisentrager decision. The Supreme Court explained clearly and \neloquently why we cannot let enemy combatants sue the U.S. military and \nour soldiers in American Federal courts. It said:\n\n       Such trials would hamper the war effort and bring aid and \n     comfort to the enemy . . . It would be difficult to devise a \n     more effective fettering of a field commander than to allow \n     the very enemies he is ordered to reduce to submission to \n     call him to account in his own civil courts and divert his \n     efforts and attention from the military offensive abroad to \n     the legal defensive at home. Nor is it unlikely that the \n     result of such enemy litigation would be a conflict between \n     judicial and military opinion highly comforting to enemies of \n     the United States.\n\n  These burdens, as identified by the U.S. Supreme Court placed on our \nmilitary by enemy combatant litigation, persist today.\n  The Department of Justice has detailed the significant burdens. It \nhas said:\n\n       The detainees have urged habeas courts to dictate \n     conditions on [Guantanamo Naval] Base ranging from the speed \n     of Internet access afforded their lawyers to the extent of \n     mail delivered to the detainees.\n\n  More than 200 cases have been filed on behalf of 600 purported \ndetainees. Curiously, this number exceeds the number of detainees \nactually held at Guantanamo Bay, which is closer to 500.\n  Also, according to the Department of Justice:\n\n       This habeas litigation has consumed enormous resources and \n     disrupted the day-to-day operation of Guantanamo Naval Base.\n\n  The United States also notes that this litigation has had a serious \nnegative impact on our war against al-Qaida. According to the U.S. \nbrief, in the al-Qaida case:\n\n       Perhaps most disturbing, the habeas litigation has \n     imperiled crucial military operations during a time of war. \n     In some instances, habeas counsel have violated protective \n     orders and jeopardized the security of the base by giving \n     detainees information likely to cause unrest. Moreover, \n     habeas counsel have frustrated interrogation critical to \n     preventing further terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\n  Michael Ratner, a lawyer who has filed lawsuits on behalf of numerous \nenemy combatants held at GTMO, boasted about disrupting U.S. war \nefforts to a magazine--Mother Earth magazine. He said:\n\n       The litigation is brutal for [the United States]. It's \n     huge. We have over one hundred lawyers now from big and small \n     firms working to represent the detainees. Every time an \n     attorney goes down there, it makes it that much harder [for \n     the U.S. military] to do what they're doing. You can't run an \n     interrogation . . . with attorneys. What are they going to do \n     now that we're getting court orders to get more lawyers down \n     there?\n\n  Former Attorney General Bill Barr explained the folly of applying \nAmerican criminal procedure and judicial process and standards to \nquestions of the enemy combatants. He said:\n\n       In armed conflict, the body politic is not using its \n     domestic disciplinary powers to sanction an errant member, \n     rather it is exercising its national defense powers to \n     neutralize the external threat and preserve the very \n     foundation of all our civil liberties. Here the Constitution \n     is not concerned with handicapping the government to preserve \n     other values. Rather it is designed to maximize the \n     government's efficiency to achieve victory--even at the cost \n     of ``collateral damage'' that would be unacceptable in the \n     domestic realm.\n\n  Attorney General Barr brought these concerns into relief with the \nvery telling hypothetical example. He said:\n\n       Let me posit a battlefield scenario. American troops are \n     pinned down by sniper fire from a village. As the troops \n     advance, they see two men running from a building from which \n     the troops believe they had received sniper fire. The troops \n     believe they are probably a sniper team. Is it really being \n     suggested that the Constitution vests these men with due \n     process rights as against the American soldiers? When do \n     these rights arise? If the troops shoot and kill them--i.e., \n     deprive them of life--could it be a violation of [their] due \n     process [rights]? Suppose they are wounded and it turns out \n     they were not enemy forces. Does this give rise to Bivens' \n     Constitutional tort actions for violation of due process? \n     Alternatively, suppose the fleeing men are captured and held \n     as enemy combatants. Does the Due Process Clause really mean \n     that they have to be released unless the military can prove \n     they were enemy combatants? Does the Due Process Clause mean \n     that the American military must divert its energies and \n     resources from fighting the war and dedicate them to \n     investigating the claims of innocence of these two men?\n       This [simply] illustrates why military decisions are not \n     susceptible to judicial administration and supervision. There \n     are simply no judicially-manageable standards to either \n     govern or evaluate military operational judgments. Such \n     decisions invariably involve the weighing of risks. One can \n     easily imagine situations in which there is an appreciable \n     risk that someone is an enemy combatant, but significant \n     uncertainty and not a preponderance of evidence. \n     Nevertheless, the circumstances may be such that the \n     President makes a judgment that prudence dictates treating \n     such a person as hostile in order to avoid an unacceptable \n     risk to our military operations. By their nature, these \n     military judgments must rest upon a broad range of \n     information, opinion, prediction, and even surmise. The \n     President's assessment may include reports from his military \n     and diplomatic advisers, field commanders, intelligence \n     sources, or sometimes just the opinion of front line troops. \n     He must decide what weight to give each of these sources. He \n     must evaluate risks in light of the present state of the \n     conflict and the overall military and political objectives of \n     the campaign.\n\n  So as we take up this important issue of terrorist tribunals, and \nreaffirming our commitment in the Detainee Treatment Act, which we \npassed just last year, these unlawful and lawful combatants--the enemy \ncaptured on the battlefield--are entitled to process, but they are not \nentitled to all of the rights and privileges of an American citizen in \na court of law.\n  It is only just and fitting we do provide this alternative process \nthrough reviewing the combat status tribunal decisions to make sure we \nare accurate as a matter of fact in detaining enemy combatants of the \nUnited States. It is entirely appropriate that we have an annual \nadministrative review board to look at and determine whether these \nindividuals should continue to be detained in light of additional \ninformation and in light of changing circumstances. And it is entirely \nappropriate that they be provided an appellate review in the District \nof Columbia Court of Appeals on all bases of decision in the combat \nstatus review tribunal and the administrative review process and also \nthat they be provided an appeal following any conviction of a war crime \nby a military tribunal. But it is not appropriate to lapse into a\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\npre-9/11 mentality of treating the war on terror as simply another law \nenforcement action, treating it as another criminal prosecution just \nsuch as any other criminal prosecution that occurs on a regular basis \nin our State and Federal courts. The dangers of doing so mean we will \nhave lapsed back into those perhaps happier times but the blissful \nignorance those happier times produced.\n  We are at war. We have an enemy that continues to try to explore our \nvulnerabilities. And as we know from the recently disrupted plot \nemanating out of London, al-Qaida and our enemies continue to try to \nfind vulnerabilities that will allow them to hit us here at home. It is \nabsolutely essential that we live up to our responsibilities as elected \nrepresentatives of the American people to maintain the safety and \nsecurity of those people by making sure we meet the obligations imposed \nupon Congress and the Federal Government by the U.S. Supreme Court and \nthat we provide basic rights as dictated by the Court in the Hamdan \ndecision. But it is not appropriate that we tie the hands of our \nmilitary commanders, that we perhaps undermine our ability to prosecute \nand win this war on terror and keep America safe by treating this war \non terror and the appellate rights of detainees in a way that makes it \nharder for us to keep America safe.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss).

Under the previous order, the hour of 5:20 \np.m. having arrived, the Senate will proceed to executive session for \nthe consideration of Executive Calendar No. 920, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Francisco Augusto \nBesosa, of Puerto Rico, to be a United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Puerto Rico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. shall be equally divided between the chairman and ranking member \nof the Judiciary Committee. The chairman is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to recommend to \nmy colleagues the confirmation of Francisco Augusto Besosa to be a \ndistrict court judge for the District of Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Besosa comes before the Senate with an impressive record. He \nreceived his Bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1971 and his \nlaw degree from Georgetown University Law Center in 1979. Prior to \nattending law school, he served as an intelligence officer in the U.S. \nArmy and was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal.\n  Mr. Besosa has had a distinguished career as a practicing lawyer in \nPuerto Rico. He has spent 70 percent of his time practicing in the \nFederal courts, with the balance in the State courts. His principal \noccupation has been in the civil field, and he has had considerable \ntrial practice. Mr. Besosa is currently a partner in the law firm of \nAbsuar Muniz Goyco and Besosa, a firm he joined in 1994. The American \nBar Association has rated Mr. Besosa ``well qualified.''\n  Mr. Besosa was passed out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously. I \nam pleased in my capacity as chairman of the committee to recommend him \nto my colleagues for confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, as we begin the last week of this \nlegislative session, the Senate considers the nomination of Francisco \nAugusto Besosa for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Puerto Rico. Mr. Besosa's nomination was reported \nunanimously to the Judiciary Committee on Thursday of last week.\n  Last week the Judiciary Committee held two business meetings \ndedicated to judicial nominations. I want to thank all Senators for \nworking with us to expedite consideration of nominations like that of \nMr. Besosa. I cooperated last Tuesday with the Chairman's request for a \nSpecial Executive Business Meeting. I came to the meeting and \nestablished the quorum. The Chairman had said that the meeting would be \nheld to burn holds on two non-controversial circuit court nominees. I \nagreed to try to expedite consideration of the nomination of Kent \nJordan, a nominee to the Third Circuit. Peter Keisler's nomination to \nthe D.C. Circuit is, however, by no means non-controversial. \nNonetheless, in an effort to work with the Chairman I stayed and the \nRepublicans held over the Keisler nomination, as well.\n  Then, although we had not discussed either in advance, in order to be \naccommodating, I did not object when, at the request of Senator \nGrassley and Senator DeWine, the nominations of John Alfred Jarvey and \nSara Elizabeth Lioi were also held over. Those nominations will now be \nreviewed and available for consideration by the Committee later this \nweek in accordance with the rules of the Committee.\n  Mr. Besosa's nomination was unanimously reported at our regular \nThursday business meeting. In addition, we reported a number of other \njudicial nominations, including one for a judicial emergency vacancy \nthat was given expedited consideration. I thank the Chairman for his \nkind words in which he acknowledged our cooperation.\n  The Democratic Senators on the Committee have worked hard to \naccommodating the Chairman's demanding schedule. The Chairman has \nalready held three hearings during the last three weeks and has another \nscheduled for this week, in addition to another special business \nmeeting. We have held 18 judicial nominations hearings this year, \nincluding a Supreme Court hearing, as well as two additional executive \nnominations hearings.\n  I have been saying for some time that I feared we would sacrifice \nprogress on nominations that can be moved for debate on controversial \nnominations. It appears that my fears will be realized this week. This \nWednesday afternoon and evening, a hearing on the highly controversial \nnomination of Michael Wallace to the Fifth Circuit has been noticed and \nrenoticed. As the times have changed, it has become even less likely \nthat it will be helpful or productive during this extremely busy time \nof year. Of course, Mr. Wallace is the first appellate court nominee in \n25 years to have been rated unanimously not qualified by the ABA peer \nreview committee.\n  After today, the Senate will have confirmed 31 judicial nominees this \nyear. The Republican Senate confirmed only 17 of President Clinton's \njudicial nominees in the 1996 session. The Senate has confirmed seven \ncircuit court nominees, which is seven more than the Republican Senate \nconfirmed with a Democratic President during the 1996 session. That \nyear, Republicans would not consider or confirm a single appellate \ncourt nomination for an entire year-long session of the Senate, not \none.\n  This is a far cry from the days when the Republican Congress pocket \nfilibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's nominees, refusing \neven to bring them up for a vote in Committee. Of course, during the 17 \nmonths that I was Chairman, we were able to confirm 100 of President \nBush's nominees. In 20 months of Republican control, with a Republican \nPresident, even counting Mr. Besosa's confirmation today, that number \nwill stand at about half that--just 53.\n  We could have accomplished more this year if the White House had sent \nover consensus nominees early in the year. The White House did not. \nMany of the nominees we are now trying to consider now were not even \nnominated until July. Regrettably, the administration concentrated on a \nfew highly controversial nominees and delayed until recently sending \nnominations and\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\nthereby prevented us from having the time to do any meaningful review. \nWe are now in the position of trying to rush through too many nominees \ntoo quickly for us to give them real consideration.\n  The White House continues to undermine our process. Instead of \nworking with us and focusing on consensus nominees, the President sent \nback to us five highly controversial nominees who had been returned to \nthe White House. Sadly, the Senate Republican leadership, which has \nrubberstamped a number of very poor nominations, may force us to spend \ntime and energy debating troublesome nominations, rather than reviewing \nand confirming good ones.\n  We have been accommodating, and we will continue to be, but the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate should not be a rubber stamp for the \nPresident's nominations. We should be taking our constitutional \nresponsibility to advise and consent seriously. That means carefully \nreviewing the nominees' records and making sure that these are \nappropriate nominees for lifetime appointments to important Federal \njudgeships.\n  A customary practice in the Senate would have been for the leaders, \nthe Republican and Democratic leaders, to have sat down with the \nChairman and the Ranking Member by now and have worked out a process to \nconclude the year with respect to judicial nominations. I would have \nurged that we concentrate on completing our work on those nominations \nmost likely to be confirmed and to maximize the number of \nconfirmations. Sadly, that meeting has not occurred and apparently will \nnot.\n  I congratulate Francisco Besosa and his family on his confirmation \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Francisco Augusto Besosa, of Puerto Rico, to be United States \nDistrict Judge for the District of Puerto Rico?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Madaras, U.S. Army, of Wilton, CT.\n  While in Boqouba, Iraq, with the 168th Combined Arms Battalion, 3rd \nBrigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, Private Madaras died on \nSeptember 3, 2006, of injuries he sustained when an improvised \nexplosive device detonated near his dismounted patrol.\n  He is remembered by those who knew him in the community as a leader \non the soccer field, a sharp and focused student, a quiet but intense \nwarrior, and as a caring and creative young man. He is remembered by \nhis comrades as a good-humored soldier in a league of extraordinary \nheroes, mature beyond his years. Described as having tremendous \npotential with a heart of courage, he caused many to wonder why he had \ninterrupted a promising education and chose the Army instead. Feeling \nuncomfortable just watching others serve, he responded to them that he \nwas compelled to do his part for his country.\n  Private Madaras epitomizes the American spirit which permeates our \ngreat Nation. Living as a true patriot and defender of our principles \nof freedom and justice, he consistently put others ahead of himself. \nWhile I am saddened by his loss, I am also both proud and grateful that \nwe have the kind of fighting force exemplified by Private Madaras \nserving in our Armed Forces.\n  Our Nation extends its heartfelt sympathy to his family. I offer my \ncondolences to his father William, to his mother Shalini, to his sister \nMarie, and to his brother Christopher. We extend our appreciation for \nsharing this outstanding soldier with us, and we offer our prayers and \nsupport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10067-4", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10067-S10068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUCCESSFUL NEW MEXICO PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss some successful \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Homeland Security programs \ncreated in my home State of New Mexico.\n  One project, the foreign language translator, is a hands-free, voice-\nactivated translator that allows troops to speak English phrases that \nare automatically broadcast in Arabic. The electronics for the \ntranslator are built by Crane Corporation of Albuquerque, NM and Laguna \nIndustries assembles and tests the units in Cibola County, NM. I \nsecured $1.4 million for this project in fiscal year 2005 Department of \nDefense funding, and its usefulness was highlighted in a June 19 Forbes \narticle which quoted a Coast Guardsman as saying the device is the best \ninterpreting tool available to date.\n  Another project, the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis \nCenter, or NISAC, is a joint Sandia/Los Alamos National Laboratories \ninitiative that was created in 2000. NISAC studies critical \ninfrastructure and models the effects of a potential terrorist attack \non such infrastructure. This work has proven invaluable to our Nation. \nNISAC accurately predicted\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\nthe effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans and was cited by the \nWhite House as a positive part of the Federal Government's efforts in \nresponse to Hurricane Katrina. I have helped fund NISAC since its \ninception, including securing $7 million for a NISAC facility in fiscal \nyear 2003 and providing $5 million more than the President requested \nfor the program in fiscal year 2006.\n  Lastly, the Expeditionary Unit Water Purification, or EUWP, Program \nis a desalination program developed by the Office of Naval Research and \ntested in Otero County, NM. I have secured more than $30 million for \nthis project, and it has been money well spent. When the water supply \nat the Coast Guard's Loran Station at Port Clarence, AK was \ncontaminated last summer, an EUWP unit was deployed to Alaska to create \nfresh water from brackish water for troops there. In the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, two EUWP units were deployed to Mississippi to \nprovide fresh water to both victims and rescue workers. Clearly, the \nprogram is accomplishing its mission.\n  I am proud of these success stories and am glad to have helped three \nsuch successful programs secure the Federal funding they needed to do--\nimportant tasks for our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10068-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10068-S10069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VISIT OF KAZAKHSTAN PRESIDENT NURSULTAN NAZARBAYEV\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to bring attention to a \nvisitor the White House plans to receive this week--the President of \nKazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev. My colleagues in this body can be \nforgiven if they haven't heard much about his visit; there aren't going \nto be any press conferences or state dinners to welcome him. In fact, \nthe Bush administration has kept very quiet about the invitation it \nextended to President Nazarbayev, who is expected to arrive later this \nweek. I don't blame them for trying to downplay the visit; President \nNazarbayev is widely acknowledged to be a corrupt dictator and someone \nwho has built a record of contempt for the rule of law, the quashing of \na nascent democracy, and the destruction of a free press. This is not \nthe kind of leader who should be granted the privilege of an official \nWhite House visit.\n  According to the State Department's most recent Human Rights Report, \nin 2005 Kazakhstan's ``human rights record remained poor. Legislation \nenacted during the year seriously eroded legal protections for human \nrights and expanded the powers of the executive branch to regulate and \ncontrol civil society . . . [The laws that were passed] encroached on \npolitical rights, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, and other \nhuman rights.'' The Justice Department and the FBI have accused \nPresident Nazarbayev--who has been in control of the country since \n1990--of corruption and reportedly considered indicting him on bribery \nand other charges under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Instead they \nindicted his personal financial adviser, James Giffen, while \nidentifying President Nazarbayev as the recipient of tens of millions \nof dollars in payoffs of cash and gifts in an oil lease deal.\n  President Bush has said that his goal is to spread democracy and the \nrule of law around the world. But this goal is hard to reconcile with \nhis support for one of the world's most repressive and corrupt \ndictatorships.\n  Mr. President, the Washington Post recently published an insightful \narticle on this issue, which I would like to have printed in the \nRecord. I hope my colleagues will have the opportunity to read it and \nwill join me in calling on President Bush to cancel this visit and send \nthe message that there is no room in the White House for those who have \nsuch disregard for democracy and the rule of law. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nWith Kazakh's Visit, Bush Priorities Clash--Autocrat Leads an Oil-Rich \n                                Country\n\n                            (By Peter Baker)\n\n       August 29, 2006.--President Bush launched an initiative \n     this month to combat international kleptocracy, the sort of \n     high-level corruption by foreign officials that he called ``a \n     grave and corrosive abuse of power'' that ``threatens our \n     national interest and violates our values.'' The plan, he \n     said, would be ``a critical component of our freedom \n     agenda.''\n       Three weeks later, the White House is making arrangements \n     to host the leader of Kazakhstan, an autocrat who runs a \n     nation that is anything but free and who has been accused by \n     U.S. prosecutors of pocketing the bulk of $78 million in \n     bribes from an American businessman. Not only will President \n     Nursultan Nazarbayev visit the White House, people involved \n     say, but he also will travel to the Bush family compound in \n     Maine.\n       Nazarbayev's upcoming visit, according to analysts and \n     officials, offers a case study in the competing priorities of \n     the Bush administration at a time when the president has \n     vowed to fight for democracy and against corruption around \n     the globe. Nazarbayev has banned opposition parties, \n     intimidated the press and profited from his post, according \n     to the U.S. government. But he also sits atop massive oil \n     reserves that have helped open doors in Washington.\n       Nazarbayev is hardly the only controversial figure received \n     at the top levels of the Bush administration. In April, the \n     president welcomed to the Oval Office the president of \n     Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, who has been accused of rigging \n     elections. And Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice hosted \n     Teodoro Obiang Nguema, the president of Equatorial Guinea, \n     who has been found to have millions of dollars stashed in \n     overseas bank accounts.\n       But the Kazakh leader has received especially warm \n     treatment, given that the same government that will host him \n     next month plans to go to trial in federal court in January \n     to prove that he was paid off in the 1990s by a U.S. banker \n     seeking to influence oil rights. Although the banker faces \n     prison time, Nazarbayev has not been charged and has called \n     the allegations illegitimate.\n       In addition to Nazarbayev's upcoming visit, Vice President \n     Cheney went to the former Soviet republic in May to praise \n     him as a friend, a trip that drew criticism because it came \n     the day after Cheney criticized Russia for retreating from \n     democracy. The latest invitation has sparked outrage among \n     Kazakh opposition.\n       ``It raises the question of how serious is the \n     determination to fight kleptocracy,'' said Rinat Akhmetshin, \n     director of the International Eurasian Institute, who works \n     for Kazakh opposition. ``Nazarbayev is a symbol of \n     kleptocracy . . . and yet they are bringing him in. That \n     sends a very clear signal to people inside Kazakhstan who are \n     very well aware that he stole money from them.''\n       The White House declined to comment because it has not yet \n     officially announced the visit, but Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary of State Evan Feigenbaum was in Kazakhstan last \n     week working out details, and Kazakh officials said the trip \n     will take place in late September. A spokesman for former \n     president George H.W. Bush confirmed that Nazarbayev will \n     visit Kennebunkport as part of his U.S. stay. ``An old friend \n     of his was in the U.S. and he extended an invitation,'' Bush \n     spokesman Tom Frechette said.\n       An administration official, speaking on the condition of \n     anonymity because the invitation has not been announced, said \n     President Bush often meets with leaders of countries ``that \n     are not yet democracies'' and uses the time to push for more \n     freedom. ``We've always been frank in our discussions with \n     government officials from Kazakhstan about our concerns about \n     lack of democratic movement, and we always press them for \n     democratic reform,'' the official said.\n       Kazakhstan, a vast nation of 15 million on the Central \n     Asian steppe, has emerged as an increasingly important player \n     in the world energy market. With the largest crude oil \n     reserves in the Caspian Sea region, Kazakhstan pumps 1.2 \n     million barrels a day and exports 1 million of that. The \n     Kazakh government hopes to boost production to 3.5 million \n     barrels a day by 2015, rivaling Iran. U.S. and Russian \n     companies and governments have competed for access to its \n     oil.\n       Nazarbayev, 66, a blast-furnace operator-turned-Communist \n     functionary, has led Kazakhstan since 1990, when it was part \n     of the Soviet Union, and has since won a series of tainted \n     elections. His government has banned or refused to register \n     opposition parties, closed newspapers and harassed advocacy \n     groups. Two opposition leaders were found dead of gunshots in \n     disputed circumstances.\n       But the Bush administration considers Nazarbayev a \n     friendly, stable moderate in a region of harsher, sometimes \n     hostile dictators and has been hopeful he will open up and \n     cleanse his government. The Kazakh government under \n     Nazarbayev recently embarked on an anti-corruption campaign \n     that has resulted in arrests of mid-level officials.\n       ``I really do think he has learned how to be clean,'' said \n     Martha Brill Olcott, a Kazakhstan specialist at the Carnegie \n     Endowment for International Peace. ``He has learned a lot \n     more about how you can promote to some degree divestiture [of \n     assets]. Most of his holdings are, I wouldn't say \n     transparent, but they're more so.''\n       Others aren't sure. ``When the United States is \n     transparently soft on friendly dictators like Nazarbayev, it \n     undermines the effort to be tough on not-so-friendly \n     dictators,'' said Tom Malinowski of Human Rights Watch.\n       Transparency International, an anti-corruption \n     organization, ranks Kazakhstan 2.6 on a 10-point scale, \n     placing it 107th out of 159 countries graded. That's a \n     decline from a 3.0 grade and 65th place in 2000.\n       ``You don't have free elections, and the press is pretty \n     much controlled by his family, and a significant portion of \n     assets in\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\n     Kazakhstan are directly or indirectly controlled by his \n     family,'' said Miklos Marschall, the group's regional \n     director. ``But on the other hand, unlike other Central Asian \n     countries, he is willing to initiate some step-by-step \n     reforms. From our perspective, he's not the worst.''\n       Nazarbayev visited the Bush White House in 2001--before the \n     Justice Department filed a case in 2003 alleging that he had \n     taken bribes and before the president issued a 2004 \n     proclamation banning corrupt foreign officials from visiting \n     the United States. A State Department official said hundreds \n     of foreign officials have been denied visas under Bush's \n     proclamation but could not explain how it would not apply in \n     Nazarbayev's case.\n       U.S. prosecutors have charged businessman James H. Giffen \n     with steering $78 million in bribes to Nazarbayev and one of \n     his former prime ministers in the 1990s in exchange for \n     influence in oil transactions. In addition to cash \n     transferred to secret Swiss bank accounts, Nazarbayev, \n     originally identified in court papers simply as ``KO-2,'' \n     allegedly received two snowmobiles, an $80,000 speedboat, fur \n     coats for his wife and daughter, and tuition for his daughter \n     at a Swiss boarding school and later George Washington \n     University.\n       Giffen's attorneys have argued that he is not guilty \n     because his actions were sanctioned by the U.S. government. \n     Giffen says he disclosed his activities to agencies including \n     the CIA and was encouraged to continue for national security \n     reasons. The Justice Department is appealing a court decision \n     allowing the defense. The case is scheduled to go to trial \n     Jan. 16.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10069-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, during the August recess, I \nheard from many physicians in Nebraska who are concerned about the \nlooming cut in their Medicare payments. If Congress does not act soon, \nNebraska's doctors will face a $17 million loss next year. In addition, \nthe cuts are scheduled to continue for the following 8 years if they \nare not reversed. During this time period, each Nebraska physician will \nlose $27,000 annually.\n  Physicians want to serve Nebraska's seniors, but they simply cannot \nafford to accept an unlimited number of new Medicare patients into \ntheir practices if Medicare payments do not keep up with the cost of \nproviding care.\n  In addition to listening to my constituents, I also think it is \nhelpful to listen to experts when making policy decisions. Medicare \npayment policy can be quite complicated, so Congress established the \nMedicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, to make recommendations \nto us. MedPAC consists of a group of health experts that annually makes \nMedicare policy recommendations to Congress. For next year, MedPAC \nrecommended that Congress eliminate the scheduled payment cut and \ninstead raise physician payments by 2.7 percent.\n  I think we should listen to Nebraska's doctors and policy experts and \nstop the Medicare cut. We are running out of time. Congress must act \nnow to stop the impending cuts. America's seniors and our health \nprofessionals deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10069-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ARTHUR SAUVIGNE, MD\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today \nto pay tribute to Dr. Arthur Sauvigne, a doctor who has made it his \nlife's work to care for veterans. Dr. Sauvigne, known to most everyone \nas Art, has decided to retire from tha Veterans' Administration after \n33 years of remarkable service. His most recent role has been as chief \nof staff at the VA Medical Center in White River Junction, VT. Although \nwe have been assured that he will continue to treat veterans in a part-\ntime capacity at the VA, I take this moment to honor him for his years \nof dedicated service.\n  Art began his VA career as a resident in internal medicine at \nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center. I like to think that Art's \ncommitment to caring for veterans began with this residency because he \nhas stayed with the VA in many different capacities ever since. Over \nthe past 33 years he has held the following positions at the White \nRiver Junction VA: staff physician, associate chief of staff for \nambulatory care, director of the emergency room, acting primary care \nservice line manager, and acting specialty and acute care service line \nmanager. Art became chief of staff in 1997.\n  In the time that my staff and I have known Art, we have been amazed \nat his breadth of medical and administrative knowledge and impressed by \nhis vision. It seems that his ideas on improving service to veterans--\nespecially veterans in rural areas--have, once implemented, served as \nnational models. One needs only spend 10 minutes with Art to get the \ntrue sense of his passion for delivering service to veterans in their \ncommunity. In fact, the White River Junction VA was a pioneer in his \narena. Long before the Congressional mandate and establishment of the \nCommunity Based Outpatient Clinic, CBOC, a mobile clinic housed in a \nmotor coach began seeing patients in 1989. In 1991, a small one-room \nclinic housed in the Burlington, VT, Vet Center became the predecessor \nof future CBOC's.\n  Art also has a firm belief that the VA, as a Government-run health \ncare system, has a greater calling and higher need to provide \nexcellence in care to its customers. He has long been involved in \ndesigning and implementing systems to improve customer services. Over \nthe years, Art has actively endorsed and in many cases taken the lead \nin establishing standards of clinical practice, improving access, \nadvancing types of services, and promoting the education of future \nhealth care providers.\n  Art's hard work was recognized when the White River Junction VA \nMedical Center was awarded the Veterans Health Administration's Robert \nW. Carey Organizational Excellence Award in 2002 and 2003 at the \n``Achievement level.'' The White River Junction VA was awarded the \nCarey Award at the ``Trophy level'' in 2004 and was the ``Circle of \nExcellence'' winner in 2005. Art would tell you this recognition had \nlittle to do with him and everything to do with the incredible staff at \nthe White River Junction VA, but I think his leadership made it a much \neasier journey.\n  Art's departure as chief of staff will leave a huge void. His \nindomitable spirit and limitless energy, even when faced by mind-\nnumbing bureaucratic inertia, are irreplaceable. He will be hugely \nmissed.

Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks \ntoday about Alabama's 2006-2007 Teacher of the Year, Ms. Cameron \nMcKinley. Ms. McKinley has been a technology specialist for the Hoover \nCity School System since she left her successful career as a \nbusinesswoman in the marketing field over 10 years ago to pursue her \ndream of teaching. Within the Hoover City School System, Ms. McKinley \nhas taught computer education, instructional technology, and summer \ntechnology camps.\n  Ms. McKinley, a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Alabama \nwith a bachelor's degree in corporate finance/investment management and \nmarketing, is a national board certified teacher.\n  I would like to commend Ms. McKinley's efforts on behalf of her \nstudents, and sincerely congratulate her for this very high honor. I \nappreciate her dedication to educate our children, as we know that an \ninvestment in our children is one of the most important investments \nthat we can make as a nation.\n  Ms. McKinley's decision to change careers to give her life to our \nchildren is a wonderful act and it is made all the more remarkable for \nbeing selected as Teacher of the Year. This is, indeed, a heartwarming \nstory. With Ms. McKinley's help, and the aid of other teachers like \nher, we will continue to raise up quality leaders that will serve our \ncountry and our children in the years to come.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10070-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 4, 2005, \nthe following enrolled bills, previously signed by the Speaker of the \nHouse, were signed on September 22, 2006, during the adjournment of the \nSenate, by the President pro tempore (Mr. Stevens).\n\n       S. 260.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the Legislature of the State of Michigan \n     relative to memorializing Congress to adopt and present to \n     the states for ratification an amendment to the United States \n     Constitution that would provide that only citizens may be \n     counted for purposes of determining congressional \n     representation among the states; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 97\n\n       Whereas, one of the cornerstones of our democratic republic \n     is the decennial census, which is the basis for congressional \n     representation and the apportionment process. The data \n     gathered through the census is used to determine how the 435 \n     members of the United States House of Representatives are \n     divided among the states; and\n       Whereas, with growing numbers of illegal immigrants \n     concentrated in a small number of states, especially \n     California, states with few illegal immigrants suffer a \n     commensurate reduction in the number of their members of the \n     United States House of Representatives. This is true for \n     Michigan, which has experienced a steady decline in \n     congressional representation over the past few decades. \n     Projections for the next reapportionment, after the 2010 \n     census, include the loss of more seats for Michigan and other \n     states with few illegal immigrants; and\n       Whereas, in 2000, an estimated 5.3 million noncitizens in \n     California were counted by the Census Bureau. In one \n     Californian district, more than 260,000 noncitizens, or 43 \n     percent of the district's population, were tabulated, a ratio \n     of almost four noncitizens for every voter. As a result, it \n     took fewer than 35,000 votes to win the district compared to \n     almost 100,000 votes to win a typical Congressional race in \n     Michigan. If only legal citizens were counted, California \n     would have been allocated six fewer seats in the House of \n     Representatives. In addition, New York, Texas, and Florida, \n     which along with California account for more than 50 percent \n     of all noncitizens residing in the United States, would have \n     been allocated one fewer Congressional seat apiece if only \n     citizens were calculated; and\n       Whereas, while estimates of actual illegal aliens in our \n     country are higher, the 2000 federal census found 7 million \n     illegal aliens. It seems wrong for illegal aliens to have as \n     profound an impact on our political environment as they \n     presently do. While immigration is a very complex issue that \n     must be addressed, it seems clear that including illegal \n     immigrants in the calculation of congressional representation \n     is wrong; and\n       Whereas, a measure has been introduced in the United States \n     House of Representatives to propose an amendment to the \n     United States Constitution that would provide that only \n     citizens may be counted for purposes of apportioning \n     congressional representation among the states. This \n     legislation, H.J.R. 53, is long overdue; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to adopt and \n     present to the states for ratification an amendment to the \n     United States Constitution that would provide that only \n     citizens may be counted for purposes of determining \n     congressional representation among the states; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.

A bill to limit the amount of funds available to the \nAerobatics Research Mission Directorate of the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration during fiscal year 2007 and fiscal years \nthereafter; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwould limit the amount of funds available to the Aeronautics Research \nMission Directorate (ARMD) of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration. We must ensure that U.S. taxpayer money is being used \nefficiently and effectively, and this measure would help in our ongoing \nefforts to streamline government programs and reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  My bill proposes to reduce the amount of funding for the ARMD from \nits 2006 level of $884 million to $724 million for fiscal years 2007 \nand thereafter. This represents a savings of $160 million per year, or \n$800 million over five years. This funding reduction reflects the \nPresident's own budget priorities; in fact, the $724 million figure \ncomes from the President's 2007 budget savings proposal. NASA is in the \nprocess of restructuring and reprioritizing, and the ARMD is a \ndirectorate that has been identified as an area where savings could be \nachieved. In the past, some of the ARMD's aeronautics work focused on \ndeveloping technologies that could have short-term commercial \napplications in the air transportation industry. This is work that \ncould be more appropriately taken on by the\n\n[[Page S10074]]\n\nprivate sector, and does not require such a massive investment from the \nFederal Government.\n  This bill should not be read to imply that the work of the ARMD is \nnot important. To the contrary, aeronautics research is perhaps some of \nthe most directly relevant work to many Americans that NASA is involved \nin. This bill simply follows up on the President's call for the ARMD to \nfocus its research efforts in the areas that are most appropriate. By \nrefocusing on long-term fundamental aeronautics research, safety \nresearch, and ways to address the needs of the future air \ntransportation system, ARMD should be able to operate effectively and \nefficiently under this spending cap.\n  One of the main reasons I first ran for the U.S. Senate was to \nrestore fiscal responsibility to the Federal budget. I have continued \nto work to eliminate wasteful spending and to reduce the soaring budget \ndeficit, which is now estimated at $300 billion this year. Unless we \nreturn to fiscally responsible budgeting, Congress will saddle our \nNation's younger generations with an enormous financial burden for \nyears to come. This bill is one small step in that direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INHOFE:\n  S. 3933. A bill to extend the generalized system of preferences; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill reauthorize a vital trade and development program--the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences (GSP). This is a program I have worked to \nreauthorize in the past, and I think it is a vital program for both \ndeveloping countries and the American economy. As someone who \nfrequently works to assist those who face the direst of circumstances \nin the poor countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, I feel that we must \nreauthorize this program as a key component of our efforts there.\n  The GSP program is an effort of the United States and 19 other \nindustrialized countries to aid developing countries through increased \nmarket access, which in turn fosters industrial development and \nenhanced opportunities for prosperity in some of the least-advantaged \ncountries in the world. This program allows a specified list of \ndeveloping countries, from the Asian Continent to Sub-Saharan Africa to \nLatin America, to export certain products duty-free to the U.S. market. \nA beneficiary country's GSP treatment is contingent upon that country's \ncommitment to securing intellectual property rights and to protecting \nthe rights of workers. In this way, the GSP program promotes the \ndevelopment of sound practices and institutions in those countries with \nwhich we are engaged in trade and thus fulfills some important \nobjectives of U.S. trade policy. In sum, the GSP program promotes self-\nsustaining production development in developing countries--not \ndependence on foreign aid--and also encourages respect for human \ndignity and property.\n  While originally developed as a trade program to aid developing \ncountries, GSP over the past 32 years has become an important component \nof the U.S. economy. American consumers enjoy lower prices on diverse \nproducts from oil to flashlights to broomhandles to cheese. \nFurthermore, numerous American small businesses retain their \ncompetitive advantage from the duty-free treatment of essential inputs, \nsuch as electrical equipment and automotive parts. American small \nbusinesses need every cost-cutting edge available to them in order to \ncontinue to create jobs and value. I first took an interest in the \nreauthorization of this program when a small business in Oklahoma that \nused GSP-covered drilling components to support domestic energy \nenhancement contacted my office and explained how failure to \nreauthorize GSP would seriously affect his business. After which, upon \nunderstanding how much this program also assists those in developing \ncountries, its reauthorization became a priority for me. Very clearly, \nalthough designed to make other less-advantaged countries more \ncompetitive, GSP has contributed to our continued competitiveness here \nin the United States.\n  Workers, consumers, and businesses in nearly 120 countries including \nour own will benefit from the continuation of this program, which \naffects the price of over 5,600 finished and unfinished goods. \nTherefore, I ask that you join me in reauthorizing the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 3934. A bill to terminate authorization for the project for \nnavigation, Rockport Harbor, Maine; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today for the Town \nof Rockport that would deauthorize a part of the Federal Navigation \nChannel in Rockport Harbor. The town, located on the active Mid-Coast \nof Maine, requested shortly after the Senate passed the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2006 that Congress decommission a 35-foot by 275-\nfoot area directly adjacent to the bulkhead at Marine Park. With this \ndeauthorization, the Town will be able to install permanent pilings to \nsecure a set of new municipal floats, which would replace the current \ntemporary float system.\n  It is my hope that this non-controversial provision will be included \nin the Water Resources Development Act of 2006 conference report rather \nthan have the Town of Rockport have to wait possibly for years before \nanother WRDA bill is considered. I urge my Senate conferees for the \nWRDA conference to include this language that was drafted by the New \nEngland Corps of Engineers who have no objection to the \ndeauthorization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10074-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 582--URGING THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES TO \n       OBSERVE GLOBAL FAMILY DAY AND ONE DAY OF PEACE AND SHARING\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mr. Inouye) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 582\n\n       Whereas in 2005, the people of the world suffered many \n     calamitous events, including devastation from tsunamis, \n     terror attacks, wars, famines, genocides, hurricanes, \n     earthquakes, political and religious conflicts, diseases, \n     poverty, and rioting, all necessitating global cooperation, \n     compassion, and unity previously unprecedented among diverse \n     cultures, faiths, and economic classes;\n       Whereas grave global challenges in 2006 may require \n     cooperation and innovative problem-solving among citizens and \n     nations on an even greater scale;\n       Whereas, on December 15, 2000, Congress adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 138, expressing the sense of Congress \n     that the President of the United States should issue a \n     proclamation each year calling upon the people of the United \n     States and interested organizations to observe an \n     international day of peace and sharing at the beginning of \n     each year;\n       Whereas, in 2001, the United Nations General Assembly \n     adopted Resolution 56/2, which invited ``Member States, \n     intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and all \n     the peoples of the world to celebrate One Day in Peace, 1 \n     January 2002, and every year thereafter'';\n       Whereas many foreign heads of State have recognized the \n     importance of establishing Global Family Day, a special day \n     of international unity, peace, and sharing, on the first day \n     of each year; and\n       Whereas family is the basic structure of humanity, thus, we \n     must all look to the stability and love within our individual \n     families to create stability in the global community: Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urgently requests--\n       (1) the people of the United States to observe Global \n     Family Day and One Day of Peace and Sharing with appropriate \n     activities stressing the need--\n       (A) to eradicate violence, hunger, poverty, and suffering; \n     and\n       (B) to establish greater trust and fellowship among peace-\n     loving countries and families everywhere; and\n       (2) that American businesses, labor organizations, and \n     faith and civic leaders are urged to join in promoting \n     appropriate activities for Americans and in extending \n     appropriate greetings from the families of America to \n     families in the rest of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10074-2", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10074-S10075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 583--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2006 AS ``NATIONAL YOUTH \n                             COURT MONTH''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Akaka, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Chambliss) submitted the following \nresolution, which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, we can come back and comment on this, but \nwhat I have just done is put an amendment on the legislation. The \nmilitary commission or Hamdan legislation--I have put that as an \namendment on the border security fence bill. I say that just so our \ncolleagues will understand the Democratic leader and I are working very \nhard to reach an agreement, and we are just about there. We need to \ntalk to some more colleagues about how we will address the Hamdan \nlegislation.\n  Because things are tight in terms of being able to finish the amount \nof business we need to do in the next 4 to 5 days, what we just went \nthrough was to set up a structure whereby we know we are going to be \nable to finish that. Again, our intent is to work out a plan to be able \nto address that legislation in a way that is agreeable to both sides. I \nthink we should be able to do that tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just briefly respond, we would \nlike to proceed as expeditiously as possible. We have been alerted by \none of my Senators that the rule XIV legislation that was brought to \nthe Senate late last week is different from the amendment that was \nfiled tonight. So some of my folks are trying to figure out what has \nhappened. We thought what was going to be filed as an amendment to this \nfence bill was the same piece of legislation that was rule XIVed. So we \nhave now a rule XIV that has been sent up, and now we have this \namendment. So that has created a little bit of confusion on our side.\n  But I also say this: I think we could work something out if we can \nget to the bill. When we start late in the session like this, any one \nSenator weighs about 1,000 pounds because any Senator can stop anything \nthey want. So we have to make sure we can get to this. It takes all 100 \nSenators to agree that is the case. If we could proceed to it, it is my \nunderstanding the majority leader would allow a limited number of \namendments. We could work on this tomorrow with some time agreements on \nit--agreements on both sides.\n  If this is not worked out, it is my understanding that what would \nhappen is that on Wednesday there would be a cloture vote on this \namendment dealing with Hamdan. That would occur on Wednesday, and then \nafter that, amendments germane in nature would be in order if, in fact, \nthe majority decided to allow any amendments to go forward.\n  So it appears to me the best chance for Senators on both sides to \nhave an opportunity to offer amendments to Hamdan would be to move to \nit tomorrow. If we cannot do that, then we will have to see what \nhappens with cloture. But I believe that is where we find ourselves \ntonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, that is exactly where we are. I think the \ngood news is both sides recognize this is a very important issue before \nthis body and before the American people and that we have had a lot of \nwork on this bill to where I think--speaking of the Hamdan \nlegislation--there is going to be very broad support. There are areas \npeople have expressed concern about, and our intent is to work out a \nunanimous consent agreement hopefully early in the morning whereby we \ncan address those with amendments.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would further say just briefly that, yes, \nwe do have this matter before us. Is it what we want? The answer is, \nprobably we think we could do better. That is why we would agree on \nthis side to have a limited number of amendments and have this body \ndecide whether the bill can be improved. We hope that can occur. As I \nhave indicated in my previous statement, it all depends on how the \nother 98 Senators feel as to whether we can move forward short of \ncloture on Wednesday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10098-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10098-S10099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 3709\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on another issue, I ask unanimous consent \nthat at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation \nwith the Democratic leader, the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 527, S. 3709, the U.S.-India nuclear \nbill.\n  I further ask consent that the managers' amendment at the desk be \nagreed to as original text for the purpose of further amendment and the \nonly other amendments in order be Feingold on Presidential \ncertification, Dorgan on fissile material production, Boxer on Iran, \nReid on Yucca Mountain, Craig on Yucca Mountain, with no second-degree \namendments in order, 1 hour of debate on each amendment, and 1 hour of \ngeneral debate on the bill, all equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask consent that following disposition of amendments and \nthe use or yielding back of time, the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 5682, the \nHouse-passed companion, that all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of S. 3709, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, and \nthat the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of H.R. 5682, as \namended, with no intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask consent that following passage of the bill, the Senate \ninsist upon its amendment and request a conference with the House, the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees, and S. 3709 be returned to \nthe calendar.\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. I received a \nrare personal telephone call today from Secretary Condoleezza Rice, \nwhich I appreciated. It was on this subject matter. I told her how I \nfelt. I told her it is unfortunate that this legislation has been put \naside since last July until today. I also told her that I personally \nsupport the legislation. I cosponsored it. I think it is important \nlegislation.\n  I told her exactly what I told the majority leader and the Indian \nForeign Minister last week; that is, I support this legislation and \nbelieve it is very important for the full Senate to act on it very \nquickly.\n  This legislation, I believe, is strongly supported by a sizable \nmajority of the Senate. I canvased our side for amendments. We have a \nnumber of amendments that have been talked about. I think that is the \nuniverse of the amendments, with rare exception. I think these are \nmanageable amendments. They are few in number. And I think we could \ncomplete this legislation very quickly. I have directed our floor staff \nto prepare a unanimous consent request to that effect.\n  We have a situation where the managers' amendment Senator Lugar and \nSenator Biden have come up with--they have not been able to work this \nout, the two managers. These are two of the most senior Members of the \nSenate. I hope they can do that in the near future.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader's request be \nmodified as follows: that once the agreement has been reached on the \nmanagers' amendment, the Senate begin consideration of S. 3709 under \nthe following limitations: that the managers' amendment be immediately \nagreed to for purposes of original text, that first-degree amendments \ndeal with similar subject matter as contained in the bill, and that \nrelevant second-degree amendments be in order.\n  Before the Chair puts the question, I would point out it would be my \nexpectation we could finish this bill very quickly. I think we could \nfinish it in 1 day. It might be a long day, but we could do that. I \nthink we could do that. I think this is important enough that we should \nhave a long day, if necessary, to do this and that agreements would be \npossible on each of our amendments. On every amendment we would offer, \nwe would agree to a relatively short time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as the \nDemocratic leader said, this is a critically important piece of \nlegislation. That is why I wanted to bring it forward tonight and am \npleased the Democratic leader so strongly supports the legislation. Our \nchallenge will be to figure out how we can address it with the \nappropriate concerns. And I understand his statement on the managers' \namendment of the chairman and ranking member, that there is a little \nmore work that needs to be done.\n  Enactment of this legislation will create significant export \nopportunities for U.S. industry, with job creation, with thousands of \nnew jobs created. There are some technical differences between the \nHouse and Senate bills that will have to be worked out in conference. \nTherefore, I do believe we should address this bill before we leave.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, right now, I will object to the \nmodification of my unanimous consent request. After a brief discussion, \nwe can come back and see if we are close to being able to take this to \nthe floor under this time agreement, with these amendments. I think we \nought to lock it down tonight. With that, I object to the modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the modification.\n  Is there objection to the original request?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. FRIST. First, let me go through the remaining business.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10099-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Res. 582\n\n       Whereas in 2005, the people of the world suffered many \n     calamitous events, including devastation from tsunamis, \n     terror attacks, wars, famines, genocides, hurricanes, \n     earthquakes, political and religious conflicts, diseases, \n     poverty, and rioting, all necessitating global cooperation, \n     compassion, and unity previously unprecedented among diverse \n     cultures, faiths, and economic classes;\n       Whereas grave global challenges in 2006 may require \n     cooperation and innovative problem-solving among citizens and \n     nations on an even greater scale;\n       Whereas, on December 15, 2000, Congress adopted Senate \n     Concurrent Resolution 138, expressing the sense of Congress \n     that the President of the United States should issue a \n     proclamation each year calling upon the people of the United \n     States and interested organizations to observe an \n     international day of peace and sharing at the beginning of \n     each year;\n       Whereas, in 2001, the United Nations General Assembly \n     adopted Resolution 56/2, which invited ``Member States, \n     intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and all \n     the peoples of the world to celebrate One Day in Peace, 1 \n     January 2002, and every year thereafter'';\n       Whereas many foreign heads of State have recognized the \n     importance of establishing Global Family Day, a special day \n     of international unity, peace, and sharing, on the first day \n     of each year; and\n       Whereas family is the basic structure of humanity, thus, we \n     must all look to the stability and love within our individual \n     families to create stability in the global community: Now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate urgently requests--\n       (1) the people of the United States to observe Global \n     Family Day and One Day of Peace and Sharing with appropriate \n     activities stressing the need--\n       (A) to eradicate violence, hunger, poverty, and suffering; \n     and\n       (B) to establish greater trust and fellowship among peace-\n     loving countries and families everywhere; and\n       (2) that American businesses, labor organizations, and \n     faith and civic leaders are urged to join in promoting \n     appropriate activities for Americans and in extending \n     appropriate greetings from the families of America to \n     families in the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10100-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10100]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n        DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER AS ``NATIONAL YOUTH COURT MONTH''\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

We have \nbeen ready to go, prepared, waiting for that propitious moment, hoping \nthat the majority leader would smile our way and give us that opening, \nthat hour or two to get this important legislation passed.

Mr. President, through the Chair, in fact, I will need to \nturn to the distinguished assistant leader as to how much time--I \nremember we had it locked down to an amount of time. It is about 7\\1/2\\ \nor 8 hours. We have a challenging week. We have to get to the DOD \nappropriations, we have to get to the Homeland Security appropriations, \nwe need to get to the terrorist tribunal legislation, we need to get to \nthe port security legislation, and we need to get to the border fence \nlegislation. We will do our best. I do understand the importance of the \nlegislation, and I want to congratulate the managers and the chairman \nand ranking member for their great work. I do understand the importance \nof it.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I just went through a host of issues that \nwe need to consider over the course of this week and our intention to \ncomplete our work by Friday or Saturday. It is going to take \ncooperation, and everybody is working together, as the Democratic \nleader and I implied a few minutes ago, in how we will address the \nlegislation surrounding the military tribunals. Again, we did file, or \nI just a few moments ago filed cloture on the Hamdan language as well \nas on the underlying border security bill. We will work, as we just \ndiscussed on the floor, very hard to come to an agreement on how we can \naddress the Hamdan legislation with the appropriate number of \namendments. The first of these votes would occur Wednesday morning, as \nthe Democratic leader pointed out, and as I said earlier. If we are \nable to get an agreement, we could actually be voting tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is the Hamdan language which has been filed in the \namendment the same as the Hamdan language that was agreed upon by the \nthree Republican Senators with the administration?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes. Yes, it is. I think what the Democratic leader said \nis that there are some changes, but as to what was introduced--Friday, \nI believe? Friday--so there are some small changes in that, but it has \nbeen agreed to by all the parties concerned.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In your judgment there is no substantive change between \nthat amendment and the language that was agreed upon?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. FRIST. The reason I am turning around is, as the Democratic \nleader said, people have been working very aggressively since the \nagreement was reached. And every change, we have really tried to go to \nboth sides--to the House, to the Senate, to the administration--so that \nwe can have as much agreement as we possibly can on this bill. So the \nchanges that have been made have been minor, as just reported to me.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the majority leader would, when he \ncompletes the motion to close for the night--if he would allow the \nSenator from Illinois to speak for 15 minutes, prior to our going out?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader for their cooperation in asking for this short period \nof time.\n  Mr. President, today there was a hearing that was held by the \nDemocratic Policy Conference under the chairmanship of Senator Byron \nDorgan of North Dakota. It was a historic hearing. It is rare for \nhearings to occur on Mondays. Usually the business of the Senate and \nHouse is concentrated on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. But this \nhearing was held on Monday in an effort, by the Democratic Policy \nConference, to call witnesses before our Senate to discuss an issue \nwhich is on the mind of most Americans. That issue, of course, is the \nwar in Iraq.\n  Senator Dorgan extended an invitation to this hearing to the \nRepublican majority leader as well as the chairman of the Republican \nConference, Senator Kyl of Arizona, in an effort to have a bipartisan \nhearing on the war in Iraq. Unfortunately, neither of those Senators \ncould attend. But Republican Congressman Walter Jones of North Carolina \ndid come over and join us in this hearing, so there was representation \nfrom the Republican House and Democratic Senators at this Democratic \nPolicy Conference.\n  The reason I bring this to the attention of those who are following \nthe business of the Senate is that I believe this hearing was historic. \nI believe it is\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\nthe first time since our invasion of Iraq that we had an opportunity to \nhear from generals and officers who were in Iraq, who worked on that \nwar and were willing to give us a critique, an analysis of their \nexperience and their view of where we are today.\n  MG John Batiste from the U.S. Army, retired; MG Paul Eaton, U.S. \nArmy, retired; and COL Hammes of the U.S. Marine Corps, retired, came \nand testified about what has gone wrong in the war in Iraq and what we \nneed to do from this time forward. One might think, if you listen to \nthe talk shows, that this is common fare in the Senate, but it is not. \nIn fact, it is one of the few times, if any, that we have allowed an \noversight hearing on the policy in Iraq.\n  If you chart the history of this country through our great wars, \nstarting with the Civil War and forward, it is not uncommon for this \nCongress, regardless of party, to bring the leaders in that war to \nWashington to ask them questions about the progress that is being made. \nBut, sadly, since the invasion of Iraq, that has not been the course of \naction.\n  What we have found, time and time again, is that this Congress has \ncalled before it for testimony those at the highest levels of the \nadministration. Of course, the Secretary of Defense, the Under \nSecretaries, and the generals in the highest command are brought \nforward. But we never reach the next tier and the next rank and the \nnext level because the perspective changes. The perspective of these \nmen who testified today was the perspective of those who had been in \ncharge of important operations in Iraq and had the responsibility of \ncarrying out a mission and protecting the lives of American soldiers \nthat were at risk.\n  What they had to say was chilling. In stark testimony, each of these \nofficers, now retired from service, having attended West Point and \ngraduated, having attended Annapolis and graduated, said the first and \nhighest priority that we had as a nation was to change the leadership \nat the Department of Defense. They felt the approach that is being \ntaken by Secretary Rumsfeld and those in his close-knit team was \ninconsistent with success and victory in Iraq.\n\n  They told of their own personal experiences when they would question \nsome of the decisions that were made by the administration and by \nSecretary Rumsfeld, only to find that they were ignored or shunned. \nThese generals gave eye-opening testimony, testimony that I wish every \nMember of the Senate could have heard. These were good witnesses to \ncall--good witnesses because the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee should hear their testimony. All of the Senators should hear \nthat testimony, when they talk about what we face.\n  When Colonel Hammes of the U.S. Marine Corps, now retired, said he \nexpects the United States to be in Iraq for another decade, 10 years or \nmore; when we hear from each of these officers that we have not \nprovided the necessary troops in the field to accomplish our mission; \nwhen each of them reflects on our efforts to build the Iraqis into an \narmy that can defend its own country and then says that the United \nStates would not invest the resources to build the Iraqi Army at that \ncritical moment in its history and now is paying a price for it--their \ntestimony, which was covered by major news media, will be reported by \nsome but should be reported to all the Members of the Senate.\n  We have a responsibility in the Senate and in the House. We serve as \nthat third branch of Government with a checks and balances system to be \ninvolved in the appointment of judges but, yes, to serve in oversight \nof the executive branch.\n  Unfortunately, that has not been the case over the last 4 years \nduring the course of this war. Very few, if any, Senators have stepped \nforward to question this administration's policy in Iraq. The \nRepublican leaders in the Senate have not scheduled hearings with \nofficers and former officers who could give us firsthand, candid, \nhonest testimony about what is going right and what is going wrong. \nThere is a fear in this administration of hearing unpopular expressions \nfrom those who have served in our military.\n  We owe it to our soldiers; we owe it to our Marines, our airmen, our \nsailors, and all who serve under America's flag, and we owe it to their \nfamilies to ask the hard questions, to demand the answers from this \nadministration.\n  Before the hearing today I contacted the Department of Defense for an \nupdate, an update on a very grim statistic. I asked how many American \nlives had been lost, our brave soldiers in Iraq. The number as of this \nmorning: 2,702. Almost 20,000 have returned with serious injuries. We \nhave spent over $325 billion on this war and continue to spend at the \nrate of $1.5 billion per week.\n  It is a grim reminder of what this war has cost, first and foremost \nin human life, but also in human suffering--the prayers and anxieties \nof American families, those who have returned with injuries that they \nwill deal with for a lifetime, and for taxpayers across the country who \nhave seen our national deficit reach record levels as this \nadministration refuses to accept the honest assessment of the cost of \nthis war and to tell the American people the sacrifices that must be \nmade for us to come home with our mission truly accomplished: 2,702 of \nour soldiers.\n  That hearing was important. I am glad that Congressman Walter Jones \ncame over so that it was a bipartisan hearing. But it is time for more. \nIt is time for us to bring those officers and soldiers before us who \nare living this war in Iraq to tell us what is really happening on the \nground. If there are ripoffs and profiteering by Halliburton and other \ncompanies, we should all take that personally. It is not only \ntaxpayers' money wasted, it is money that is not being spent for the \ndefense of our troops. It is money that is being misused when it could \nbe used better so that our troops could get their job done, and done \nmore effectively.\n  When Colonel Hammes of the U.S. Marine Corps talks about the \ndeterioration of production capacity in the United States, he marvels \nat that time in history when we were producing 4,000 planes a month, \nduring World War II, and now we find, for the best armored vehicle that \nwe need to move our troops, the best America can do is produce 48 a \nmonth? It is a good, valid question: why this war effort has not meant \nmore dedication from our elected officials and the public sector as \nwell as the private sector.\n  It is interesting that each of these military leaders pointed a \nfinger at Congress and at political leaders as well. All the criticism \nwas not reserved just for the Secretary of Defense and military \nplanners who brought us into this war. They said to us in stark terms \nthat we have not communicated to the American people what it will take \nto win. They believe, and I share their belief, that the American \npeople, when challenged, will rise to the challenge. We have done it \ntime and again throughout our history.\n  This hearing, which lasted a little over 2 hours, attracted a number \nof Senators and Congressman Jones from the House and should have taken \nplace a long time ago. As Major General Batiste said--he has been out \nof the military after 30-plus years of service. He has been critical of \nwhat has happened. Today was the first time anyone had invited him to \nCapitol Hill to testify. We need to bring in these men and women who \nwill share with us the responsibility of holding our Government and our \nleaders accountable in time of war.\n  When so many lives are at stake, when so much is at stake, this \nCongress has to rise to the challenge and rise to the occasion. \nUnfortunately, that has not occurred. We have done little or nothing \nwhen it comes to accountability for taxpayer dollars, for the course of \nthis war and strategy, and most importantly for the lives that have \nbeen lost. We can do better.\n  We need a new direction when it comes to our policies in Iraq, a \ndirection which doesn't call for immediate withdrawal but a direction \nwhich says there will come a day--and soon--when American troops can \ncome home with their mission accomplished. And it is time for us to \nbegin to initiate that conversation.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan for those who attended today. I think it was \ntime well spent.\n  I hope, when we return after this election on November 7, we can in a \nbipartisan fashion have real oversight of this war, ask those important \nquestions which our troops deserve to have\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\nanswered, ask the important questions our taxpayers need to have \nanswered about the cost of this conflict, and ask those important \nquestions as to how we can reach a time--and soon--when our soldiers \ncan return home victorious, with their mission truly accomplished.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2006/09/25/senate-section/article/S10107-1", "month": "09", "year": "2006", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:45 A.M.
