At 5:30, we will begin a 1-hour period \nof debate prior to a vote at 6:30 on the motion to proceed to the \nresolution of disapproval on regulations relating to mercury.

Mr. President, I am pleased to report that hour by hour, \nday by day, we are making steady progress in the rescue and recovery \nefforts in response to the natural disaster witnessed now a week and a \nhalf ago. As I speak, there are 20,000 Active military personnel on the \nground, along with 50,800 National Guard, 4,000 Coast Guard, and 8,900 \nFEMA responders. There are over 1,000 uniformed commissioned public \nhealth personnel on the ground as we speak.\n  Law and order in New Orleans has been completely restored. Power is \nback for most of the city's central business district. City hall has \nrunning water and electricity. The Army Corps of Engineers reports that \nthe city will be completely drained by early October. Hundreds of city \nengineers have been working around the clock, even sleeping on the \nfloors of their pumping stations, to drain the toxic flood waters out \nof the city.\n  Aaron Broussard, president of Jefferson Parish, is seeing continual \nprogress. In his words, we are feeding more people, we are recovering \nmore people, the infrastructure is more improved, we are clearing more \nroads, we have more power--every day more victories.\n  Meanwhile, the Federal Government remains committed to helping \nshoulder the burden. To date, Congress has allocated more than $62 \nbillion in aid for rescue relief and recovery efforts. President Bush \nhas granted the hurricane survivors special evacuee status which will \nmake it easier for the storm victims to collect Federal benefits such \nas food stamps, childcare, and Medicaid wherever they are in America.\n  FEMA has begun distributing $2,000 per household so that the \nsurvivors can start to get back on their feet and meet their immediate \nneeds. This week, Congress will continue to clear\n\n[[Page S9894]]\n\nmeasures to cut redtape and bureaucratic tangles to help hurricane \nvictims get the assistance they need. I expect the Senate over the week \nto clear legislation making it easier for evacuees to receive welfare \nbenefits and student aid.\n  We also intend to boost FEMA's borrowing authority from $1.5 billion \nto $3.5 billion. The national flood insurance program administered by \nFEMA is facing its greatest losses in history. We need to make sure \nthey have the resources they need so that victims receive appropriate, \nproper, and timely payment.\n  We are also working on ways to spur private investment in this \noverall rebuilding effort. Katrina is estimated to have swept away over \n400,000 jobs. People need these jobs, and the Gulf Coast needs to be \nrebuilt bigger, more modern, and more prosperous so that it can provide \neconomic opportunity. We will continue to press forward with the joint \nhearings announced last week on the preparations for hurricanes and \nthat immediate disaster response. We need to find out what went wrong, \nwhat went right, what worked, and what did not.\n  It is clear that things did not turn out as we would like for them to \nat a response level, at the Federal level, at the State level, or at \nthe local level. There have been problems at all levels of government, \nand we will get to the bottom of those problems.\n  Through it all, America will emerge smarter, stronger, and more \neffective in how we respond to disaster, natural and manmade. Nature \nhas dealt a painful blow, but America does stand unified, and in the \npast 2 weeks her citizens have shown tremendous courage, generosity, \nand outpouring of spirit. Countless people are pouring out their \nhearts, time, and resources, and literally opening their homes to \nshelter and comfort the survivors. There are over 1.1 million people \ndisplaced. About half of those, or about 500,000, have been displaced \nto other States than those three most affected States. Private \ndonations to hurricane relief funds have soared to nearly $700 million. \nThe American Red Cross alone has received $500 million in gifts and \npledges. Thirty-six thousand Red Cross volunteers are serving in over \n675 shelters in 23 States.\n\n  The Salvation Army has received over $65 million. America's Second \nHarvest has raised nearly $12 million and delivered 16 million pounds \nof food. The list goes on. These are but a few examples.\n  Americans from all across the country and all walks of life are \nasking what they can do to help. The past 2 weeks stand as a testament \nto the depth and strength of our national character and civic bonds. \nMillions of citizens, millions of Americans, are committed to the care, \nnurture and well-being of one another. The rescue and recovery will \ncontinue. The cities and towns all across that Gulf Coast will be \nrebuilt. They will reemerge more modern and more prosperous than ever \nbefore. The Senate will continue moving forward on behalf of our fellow \ncitizens and on behalf of future generations who will call the gulf \ncoast home.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9894-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9894-S9895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS TO BE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES \n                             SUPREME COURT\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today the Senate Judiciary Committee began \nits hearings on President Bush's nomination of Judge John Roberts to be \nthe next Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I remain undecided \nand open minded, as I believe virtually all of my colleagues have also \nstated themselves to be, about the nominee. I will remain so until \nthose hearings are complete. Nevertheless, I commend President Bush for \nacting swiftly and responsibly to nominate the successor to the very \ndistinguished and dedicated former Chief Justice William Rehnquist. His \ntragic death, along with the announced resignation of Justice Sandra \nDay O'Connor, has created a second vacancy on the Supreme Court, a \nvacancy for which the President has not yet nominated a replacement but \nmay do so any time in the future.\n  So it is not surprising that even while Judge Roberts confirmation \nhearings are just beginning, many Americans are already looking ahead \nand are attempting to influence the President's decision on this second \nSupreme Court nominee.\n  While President Bush unquestionably has the right to nominate the man \nor woman--I personally hope it is the woman--of his own choosing, and \nin fact the President has earned that right by his reelection last \nNovember, I believe he has the responsibility to select someone who \nwould be the choice of the vast majority of all Americans, for this \nwoman or man will be a Supreme Court Justice for all Americans living \ntoday and likely for all Americans yet to come for many years ahead. If \nconfirmed, she or he will take an oath of office, as each of us has \ndone, to uphold the Constitution of this great country, a 216-year-old \ndocument which still lives today to guarantee and protect the rights, \nthe freedoms, and the responsibilities of all 290 million American \ncitizens--not just the majority or the minority, not just Republicans \nor Democrats, not just conservatives or liberals, not just Christians, \nMuslims, or Jews, not just some but all Americans.\n  That responsibility--of the President, of this Senate, and of each \nSupreme Court Justice--to all Americans is why I found so disturbing an \narticle in last Saturday's Washington Post. The front page lead-in \nsaid:\n\n       In defense of Alberto Gonzales, supporters counter the idea \n     that the Attorney General is too moderate for the High Court.\n\n  Alberto Gonzales, as we all know, is the Attorney General of the \nUnited States and is widely considered to be one of the President's \nmost likely considered nominees to fill this second Supreme Court \nvacancy. The Washington Post story's headline reads: ``Gonzales is \nDefended as Suitable for the Court.''\n  The article begins:\n\n       Supporters of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales have \n     launched a campaign to rebut criticism that he is not \n     reliably conservative enough to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n  I find those words bizarre. Accurate, I have no doubt, in portraying \na bizarre situation caused by the bizarre behavior of some bizarre \npeople who are--and this is where it becomes frighteningly bizarre--\nseriously trying to determine who the President of the United States \nwill or will not nominate to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It shall not be, they decree, someone too moderate to be suitable for \nthe Supreme Court. Too moderate to be suitable to serve on the U.S. \nSupreme Court? What terrible acts of moderation has Attorney General \nGonzales committed to make himself unsuitable, unfit or unqualified?\n  According to the article, as a justice on the Texas supreme court 5 \nyears ago, then-Judge Gonzales sided with the court's majority in \nupholding the constitutionality of a Texas State law that provided a \njudicial bypass to allow a State judge, in exceptional circumstances, \nto allow a minor woman to obtain an abortion without her parents' \nnotification. According to the article, Judge Gonzales:\n\n     . . . wrote that he felt a duty to follow the law without \n     imposing my moral view, even if the ramifications may be \n     personally troubling to me as a parent.\n\n  In other words, he did what a State or Federal Supreme Court Justice \nis sworn to do, to decide upon the constitutionality of legislation \nthat State legislatures or the Congress passes and that Governors or \nPresidents sign into law, based upon the written State and U.S. \nConstitutions, regardless of their personal views. If that is \nconsidered too moderate to be suitable for the Supreme Court, then this \ncountry is headed for the extreme deep end.\n  On the other side, to prove that the Attorney General is not too \nmoderate to be suitable for the Supreme Court, his supporters \nreportedly note that, as President Bush's White House counsel, he \nsuccessfully excluded the American Bar Association from the judicial \nselection process. That proves he is suitable? As I said, this \npolitical psychodrama has taken the bizarre twist of Alice in \nWonderland, where black is white and up is down; where suitable is \nunsuitable and unsuitable becomes suitable, except that this is no \nplay, and these people are not playing around. The stakes couldn't be \nhigher, and these people are playing for them all. The stakes are the \nfuture of the\n\n[[Page S9895]]\n\ncountry and all the people, all of the people who live in this great \nUnited States of America.\n  One conservative activist is quoted in the Post story:\n\n       You finally get a Republican President a real Republican \n     majority in the Senate and then you don't move the country to \n     the right? It would be totally demoralizing to the \n     President's supporters.\n\n  First of all, this notion that the U.S. Supreme Court is some liberal \nbastion is itself bizarre and wrong. Seven of the nine Justices on the \ncurrent Court were named by Republican Presidents. Chief Justice \nRehnquist and three Associate Justices were nominated by President \nReagan, two by former President George W. Bush, one by President Ford \nand two by a Democratic President, President Clinton. But that \ncomposition of the Court, 7 of 9 nominees by Republican Presidents, \nthat is not enough for the activist zealots. They believe that some of \nthose Republican judicial nominees had become too moderate, once they \nwere safely confirmed and placed on the Supreme Court.\n  Too moderate for them is a judge who has independent views. Too \nmoderate is a judge who has sworn to uphold the Constitution and not to \nimpose his or her views on that process of legislation and enactment \ninto law as prescribed by the U.S. Constitution. Too moderate for them \nmeans refraining from judicial activism, which they profess to oppose \nbut in fact oppose only when they disagree with the Court's findings.\n  Government is not a Burger King. You are not supposed to all ``have \nit your way.'' People who think getting their own way all the time, \nespecially from the U.S. Supreme Court, is somehow a measure of \nPresidential greatness are seriously wrong. People who are demoralized \nif they do not get it all their own way, especially from the U.S. \nSupreme Court, are dangerously misguided. I implore President Bush to \nrise above his base, as it is described in the article. If it is not to \nbe Attorney General Gonzales, then someone else who is moderate and who \nis therefore suitable, who is therefore qualified to serve in this \nhighest Court of the land. It may not serve the perceived interests of \nsome of his misguided supporters, but it will serve the best interests \nof all of his supporters, who are all of us--all of the American \npeople. He is the President of all of us. He was elected through our \nprocess to represent all of us, to be supported when we can, and \nultimately, in the office he serves, by all Americans. It is the \nprocess for him to nominate and for this body to confirm a U.S. Supreme \nCourt Associate Justice who will also serve, look out for and serve all \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9895-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9895-S9896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERTS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee, as we know, \nhas started hearings on the nomination of John Roberts to be the Chief \nJustice of the United States. I am confident that Chairman Specter, \nRanking Member Leahy, and the other committee members will do a good \njob exploring the nominee's qualifications for the job and thoroughly \nexplore his judicial philosophy.\n  There is much at stake in these hearings. If confirmed, Judge Roberts \nwill serve as Chief Justice for the next several decades. He will be \nthe head of the third branch of the Federal Government and the most \nprominent judge in the world.\n  The Senate's duty to render advice and consent, with respect to his \nnomination, is one of the most critical tasks we will face in this \nCongress. I am very happy that no Democrat has prejudged the Roberts \nnomination. Not a single Democratic Senator has stated how they will \nvote on this nomination. Some may be leaning toward supporting him; \nothers may be leaning against him. But every Democrat knows that we \nneed to wait for these hearings, the questions and answers, the \nstatements by Mr. Roberts and the independent witnesses before making a \nfinal decision. That is the responsible way to approach a nomination \nsuch as this.\n  I look forward to hearings, hearings that I know will be respectful, \ndignified, and thorough. I, personally, have encouraged Judge Roberts \nto answer questions fully and forthrightly. I, for one, am enormously \nimpressed with Judge Roberts career and his obvious legal skills. I met \nhim in my office right across the hall.\n  I said: How many trials have you had, Judge?\n  He said: None.\n  This man is an appellate advocate. He has argued nearly two score \ncases before the U.S. Supreme Court and many others at various \nappellate levels. I enjoyed meeting with him. It was soon after he was \nnominated. I saw him last week at the funeral for Justice Rehnquist. \nThe only thing that I am troubled about, and I am troubled, is some of \nthe memos he wrote during the Reagan administration regarding women's \nrights and other civil rights issues. In more recent years, he appears \nto have been a thoughtful, mainstream judge on the DC Circuit. I want \nto give Judge Roberts an opportunity to convince the Senate, the \nAmerican people and myself that, as a Supreme Court Justice, he could \ncontinue to be a fair, evenhanded judge and not revert to his \nideological roots that we saw during the Reagan years. If he can meet \nthat test, I can support him. If he doesn't, if he is not persuasive on \nthat point, I cannot support him. The burden is on John Roberts.\n  The Supreme Court hearings are likely to dominate the news today, but \nlet's all remember, these hearings are about whether one man is \nqualified to fill one job. While we carefully weigh that important \ndecision, I remind all my colleagues that, as we speak, there are \nhundreds of thousands of Americans without jobs, without homes, and \nthey are losing hope as a result of our inaction. These are the people \nin the Gulf Coast region. We must get our priorities in line. It has \nbeen nearly 2 weeks since flood waters poured into Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Alabama, and the terrible windstorms hit them. That is \n2 weeks. Thousands of families have gone without shelter, schools for \ntheir kids, health care for their injuries and the resources they need \nto pick up and move on with their lives.\n  In the Senate, we passed two supplemental appropriations bills. That \nis good. It is a start, but it is not nearly enough. Along with Senator \nLandrieu, my colleagues and I introduced the Katrina Emergency Relief \nAct last week. The act would make changes in law that we need to give \nsurvivors health care, housing, education, and personal financial \nrelief. We are trying to add these provisions to the Commerce, Justice, \nand Science appropriations bill. We had hoped the Senate would act on \nthese items promptly, but it appears the majority will use procedural \ndevices to prevent them from passing or even allowing votes on them. \nThat is unfortunate. Thousands of survivors still are living on cots in \nthe Astrodome and other places, makeshift shelters all across the \ncountry. These victims do not care about Senate procedures. They know \nthat they need help now, not more redtape.\n  I believe America can do better, and we Democrats will continue to \npress for action on these items in the days ahead. The Government \nturned its backs on Katrina's victims once. We can't let it happen \nagain.\n  In addition to votes on the four amendments to the Commerce \nappropriations bill that we want, we should help victims and help our \ntroops by bringing to this floor the Defense authorization bill. Unlike \nthe Commerce bill, the Defense bill is an amendable vehicle. Through \nthis bill, the Senate would be able to get legislation here now and act \non it. The Katrina relief emergency matter could be brought before the \nSenate and we could vote on it to help Katrina victims now.\n\n  But just as importantly, we need to act on the Defense authorization \nbill so we can get to our troops serving in Iraq and Afghanistan and \ntheir families the resources and support they deserve. The Defense bill \ndelivers a better quality of life, state-of-the-art equipment, new \nhousing for our troops, and relief for their families. This bill \nprovides critical health care benefits for guardsmen and veterans. It \nalso increases the\n\n[[Page S9896]]\n\nend strength of the reservists, Army and Marine Corps, so we can begin \nto take steps to relieve the stress of these overstretched Active \nmilitary personnel.\n  This bill should be at the top of our Senate agenda, but I am sorry \nto say it is not. It is hard to comprehend that since May this bill has \nbeen literally languishing. It was reported out of the Armed Services \nCommittee in May. We worked for a couple of days on it here on the \nfloor. The Senate was not permitted to complete action on this \nimportant measure. We were working on this bill for a short time in \nJuly before the leader decided to set it aside in favor of the gun \nliability legislation. The gun liability legislation is the law. It has \nbeen signed by the President. The Defense authorization bill should be \nthe law so our troops who are on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan can \nget the help they need and give the families of the approximately 2,000 \nmen and women who have been killed in Iraq the knowledge that we are \ndoing something to help the people on the ground and to help the \nhundreds of thousands of veterans who have been spawned as a result of \nthis war. This doesn't take into consideration the tens of thousands \nwho have been injured and wounded in this war. Those fighting in Iraq \ndeserve it. Those fighting in Afghanistan deserve it. Our veterans \ndeserve it.\n  Americans can do better than this. The Defense bill should be taken \noff the back burner and placed on the front burner right now.\n  Our troops--I repeat--and the victims of Katrina are literally crying \nfor our help. In the days ahead, we will owe the victims of Katrina and \nall the American people something in addition to relief. We will owe \nthem answers. Four years after 9/11, the Government was supposed to be \nprepared for a crisis such as Katrina. Yet, as we all saw, the Federal \nGovernment was not, and we owe it to the American people to find out \nwhy.\n  Today on public radio, they had a number of pieces on Katrina, but \nthe one that stands out in my mind was the story of St. Bernard Parish \nPresident Henry ``Junior'' Rodriquez who told of how it took 5 days \nbefore anybody came to help his parish of some 80,000 people. And the \nfifth day, did we see FEMA coming to help them, or American troops? No. \nHis first sign of help was the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. \n``Junior'' Rodriguez deserves to know why it took so long to get his \nparish help. All Americans should know.\n  Americans can do better. When we searched for answers following 9/11, \nDemocrats and Republicans came together and established an independent \nblue ribbon commission that was a great success. Too bad we didn't \nfollow all the recommendations. But Democrats, Republicans and, most \nimportantly, the American people embraced its answers. Senator Clinton \nhas proposed that we need another independent commission, and we need \nit now.\n  I close by reminding everyone that times have changed. Times are \ndifferent today than they were 2 weeks ago. We now have different \npriorities after Katrina, and our actions in the weeks ahead should \nreflect these new priorities. It is not business as usual for the \nfamilies along the Gulf, and it should not be business as usual for us \nhere.\n  Nowhere is this more clear than in the budget that is before this \nbody. I spoke about that budget the night it came before us. I read a \nletter written to me by the mainline Protestant churches in America. \nThey said please tell everyone this budget which you are about to pass \nis immoral. This is certainly worse than it was then.\n  I point out to everyone the results of the recent Census Bureau \nreport which show that poverty rose for the fourth year in a row. \nIncomes dropped again, and more Americans are going without health care \nthan the year before--almost a million more than the past year without \nhealth care.\n  Combine these facts and figures with the images of Katrina--images of \nthe poorest and neediest among us bearing the brunt of a national \ntragedy--and ask yourself this question: Should we proceed with this \nbudget that was immoral the night it was passed and even more so now, \nthat cuts taxes for the rich and cuts Medicaid by $10 billion, cuts \nfood stamps, student loans, and other programs for the neediest among \nus? The answer, of course, is no. We must revisit these priorities in \nthe budget resolution.\n  America can do better. We can't change the past, but we can change \nthe future. We can put the Senate's priorities in line with the \nAmerican people, and there is no excuse not to do that.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business. The \nprevious order provided morning business between 2 and 3 equally \nbetween the majority and minority. The minority has consumed 30 minutes \nin morning business. So the Senator, if he wishes to speak, would have \nto ask unanimous consent to be allowed to speak on the majority's time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak for 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9896-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9896-S9897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NUCLEAR STRIKE PLAN\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I read an item on the front page of the \nWashington Post yesterday which was both surprising to me and also \nextraordinarily disappointing: ``Pentagon Revises Nuclear Strike \nPlan.'' The strategy includes preemptive use of nuclear weapons. Let me \nread a portion of this and describe why I am so dismayed.\n\n       The Pentagon has drafted a revised doctrine for the use of \n     nuclear weapons that envisions commanders requesting \n     presidential approval to use them to preempt an attack by a \n     nation or a terrorist group using weapons of mass \n     destruction. The draft also includes the option of using \n     nuclear arms to destroy known enemy stockpiles of nuclear, \n     biological or chemical weapons.\n\n  The draft Pentagon document is titled ``Doctrine for Joint Nuclear \nOperations.'' It is written under the direction of Air Force GEN \nRichard Myers, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. According to the \narticle in the Post, the document is currently available on the \nPentagon Web site. It describes new circumstances might call for \npreemptive use of nuclear weapons by this country.\n  We saw what has happened with respect to a natural disaster in the \nGulf Coast of this country. We saw the devastation of that. Yet that \nwould perhaps be a fraction of the devastation if we have a nuclear \ndevice go off in one of America's cities, a terrorist acquiring a \nnuclear weapon and detonating it in one of America's cities. This \ncountry has a responsibility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, to \npreach to the world that nuclear weapons must never again be used. Yet \nthis country is now developing policies and putting them on the Web \nthat say here is a new approach in which we might use a preemptive \nstrike of a nuclear weapon.\n  If we get the Defense authorization bill back in the Senate soon, we \nwill have a debate about the development of a new kind of nuclear \nweapon, a bunker buster nuclear weapon, an Earth-penetrating bunker \nbuster nuclear weapon. Why? Because this Administration thinks we need \na new designer nuclear weapon to bust bunkers.\n  We ought not be building nuclear weapons. We ought not build new \nnuclear weapons. We have stockpiles of thousands of nuclear weapons, \nthe detonation of one of which by a terrorist group would kill \nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, maybe millions of people.\n  The role for this country is to provide world leadership to stop the \nspread of nuclear weapons, not to be talking to the world about \nconditions under which we might use nuclear weapons preemptively. It is \nstark raving nuts to be doing this. I cannot understand what they can \npossibly be thinking about.\n  The fact is we have American soldiers fighting in the country of \nIraq. This Senate authorized the President to initiate hostile actions \nagainst Iraq based on a substantial body of intelligence given to us by \nour intelligence\n\n[[Page S9897]]\n\norganization, most of which turns out to have been absolutely wrong. \nDead wrong. Yet we are talking about preemptive strikes with nuclear \nweapons. I don't understand it.\n  If I might, by consent, I will show something from my desk. Mr. \nPresident, I ask I be permitted to show this. It is a portion of a wing \nstrut from a Soviet Backfire bomber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Why do I have this in my desk? We did not shoot this \nbomber down. We sawed the wing off this bomber, paid for with American \ntaxpayers' money. Does anyone know why? Because of arms control \nagreements by which we reduced the number of nuclear weapons and the \nnumber of nuclear delivery systems--and that includes missiles, bombers \nand submarines. So I have in the Senate a piece of a wing from a Soviet \nbomber that used to carry nuclear weapons that would threaten this \ncountry.\n  How did that happen? Because Senators Nunn and Lugar and others, \nalong with President Clinton, working on arms control agreements, had \nthe foresight to put together a program by which we reached agreements \nby which we reduce the number of nuclear weapons and reduce the number \nof carriers of those nuclear weapons. So I have part of a wing strut \nfrom a Backfire bomber.\n  I also have ground-up copper wire from a Soviet submarine that used \nto carry nuclear tipped missiles aimed at this country.\n  That is our job. Our job is to reduce the nuclear threat. Not use the \nthreat of nuclear weapons against other countries or talk about \nconditions under which we would use the nuclear weapons in a preemptive \nstrike. This is nuts.\n  We will start debating this once again in the Senate. We have these \nfolks, and we have plenty of them here, who want to build new nuclear \nweapons. They want to start testing the ones we have. We do not need to \ntest nuclear weapons. We know they work. And they want to build new \nnuclear weapons, Earth-penetrator bunker busters. It is exactly the \nwrong thing for this country to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9897-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HURRICANE KATRINA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, over the past few days, as we have talked \nabout the heartbreak of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina, I \nhave noticed that certain firms have been hired now to go in and \nprovide assistance. One of the firms is the Halliburton Corporation. I \nhave held hearings in the policy committee about this company, because \nthere have been numerous serious allegations of fraud, waste, and abuse \ninvolving it, and yet none of the Senate's authorizing committees will \ninvestigate it.\n  Every time you talk about Halliburton someone says, you are \ncriticizing the Vice President because he used to be president of \nHalliburton.\n  Well, this has nothing to do with the Vice President. It has to do \nwith the American taxpayers getting bilked by a company that is \noverbilling. I will not go through the whole list of scandals. We have \nhad hearing after hearing to explore them, because the authorizing \ncommittees will not. But this is a company that was paid to feed 42,000 \nsoldiers in Iraq; yet they were only feeding 14,000. That means they \nare overbilling by 28,000 meals a day. And that is just the tip of the \niceberg. It is unbelievable the amount of waste, fraud, and abuse that \nis going on.\n  And now, when it comes to dealing with Katrina, no-bid contracts, \nonce again, win Katrina work. And we hear that Halliburton is now \ngetting millions of dollars to do hurricane related work. I wonder who \nis minding the store? And when will someone start to care?\n  Incidentally, a woman by the name of Bunnatine Greenhouse was demoted \nlast week in the Pentagon. She was the highest ranking civilian ever in \nthe Corps of Engineers. She rose to that position, getting outstanding \nreviews all along the way. And then she spoke up. In the good old boy \nnetwork, when they wanted to award no-bid contracts to Halliburton in \nIraq, she spoke up. All of a sudden she gets demoted. She spoke up \nbecause she said what was going on was scandalous. The American \ntaxpayer takes a bath as a result of all of this.\n  Let me tell you what she has told the Congress. Bunnatine Greenhouse, \nthe highest ranking civilian employee in the Corps of Engineers, who \nrefused to sign the no-bid contracts that went under a buddy system to \nHalliburton in Iraq, says:\n\n       I can unequivocally state that the abuse related to the \n     contracts awarded to KBR [Halliburton] represents the most \n     blatant and improper contract abuse I have witnessed during \n     the course of my professional career.\n\n  For blowing the whistle, she gets demoted. This is a woman who has \nhad outstanding reviews by everyone along the way.\n  We have heard from people who worked for Halliburton who testified \nthat the managers of this company said, When U.S. Government auditors \ncome, do not dare speak to them. If you do, one of two things will \nhappen. You will be fired or we will send you to the hot spots where \nthere is active fighting in Iraq.\n  These are people who testified that they are providing food service \nto American soldiers and routinely serve food, the date stamp of which \nis expired, and they are told by Halliburton managers, feed it to them \nanyway.\n  I hope some day, some way, the people in Congress who have the \ncapability to issue subpoenas and hold oversight hearings will finally \nstart doing their job. We ought not go back to the same well for the \nreconstruction with respect to the devastation wrought by Hurricane \nKatrina. The victims of that hurricane need help. They need good help. \nThe American taxpayer shouldn't be taking a bath while that help is \ngiven.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes for the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. If the Senator will yield, I caught the tail end of the \nSenator's comments about Halliburton. Of course, we have people who \nwork in Louisiana for Halliburton, but I most certainly understand the \nSenator's concern if there are these accusations against Halliburton in \nIraq. We want to be very careful with our reconstruction dollars right \nhere at home, that companies we ask to do work are doing good work, \nbeing accountable to the taxpayers.\n  As the Senator knows, while it may be hard to track some of this \nacross the ocean, it will be easier when it is in the United States. I \ndon't know if the Senator would have any suggestions. Are there other \ncompanies that can do some work along the lines of reconstruction other \nthan this one company? Does the Senator know?\n  Mr. DORGAN. In response to the Senator from Louisiana, I understand \nin circumstances such as this, we will not go out and get bids and ask \nfor 30 days. We want people in the field working quickly. But the fact \nis we have a lot of great companies out there in this country with a \ngreat ability to mobilize and move quickly. My only point is, I want \nthe victims of this hurricane to receive help now, immediately. I want \nthe American taxpayer to find that help was delivered effectively and \nefficiently. I don't want it running through people's hands into \npeople's pockets where it shouldn't go.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I hope, Mr. President, as we lay out the rebuilding \nefforts for the Gulf Coast region and the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina, we can do better than what the Senator has spoken about.\n  On that subject, just for the record, I think maybe the Senator from \nLouisiana, Mr. Vitter, and I would like to submit for the Record a list \nof Louisiana-Mississippi-based contractors that can do great work in \nthe rebuilding of the Culf Coast region. We understand that Halliburton \nis a Texas company. We are happy for our Texas counterparts. As I said, \nmany people in Louisiana work for Halliburton. I think we have several \nthousand people who do. But I want this Senate to know--Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle--we have a lot of Louisiana and Mississippi \ncontractors who can build houses, et cetera.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9898-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9898]]\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is day 15 of Hurricane Katrina, \nwhich has devastated the southeastern part of Louisiana and parts of \nMississippi and some parts of Alabama and other States. I have come to \nthe floor, just for a few minutes, to give a few brief remarks--some on \na positive note as to some positive things that are taking place, and \nthen some which are descriptive detail as Senators, both Republicans \nand Democrats, begin to build ideas for the rebuilding of this great \nregion.\n  First, let me say how pleased I am that a group of Senators will be \ncoming down to the region on Friday. Details of that trip will be \nannounced, but Senators from Mississippi and Louisiana have suggested \nthat some of our colleagues come down and see firsthand the \ndevastation. Not wanting to use assets that were being required for \nsearch and rescue, now that phase is almost completed, and it is \nappropriate for Senators to come down. I understand Senator Reid and \nSenator Frist are organizing that trip with some of the Senators here. \nSenator Vitter and I and others look forward to getting them down on \nthe ground to show them the breadth of the devastation.\n  One point on that: This is a picture of New Orleans that was done by \nthe New York Times. I thought it was extremely helpful, and I would \nlike to take a moment of my short time on the floor to show this \npicture in a larger view.\n  We understand the city of New Orleans has been particularly hard hit, \nnot only by the hurricane but the subsequent breaches of the levees \nthat put most of the city under 10 feet of water for 5 days, 6 days. \nEven going into actually today, the 15th day of this disaster, there is \nstill water in the city, which is being pumped out now that the levees \nhave been fixed. But the water is still not completely gone.\n  In addition, in the picture you can see Jefferson Parish. I am going \nto try to provide an update of that tomorrow. Over here is St. Bernard \nParish. Again, I am going to try to provide an update. On this side of \nthe lake is St. Tammany Parish, and I will try to get to that in \nanother day or so.\n  But as Senators come down to view this whole region--not just New \nOrleans but an area of 90,000 square miles, the size of Great Britain, \nstretching from the Gulf Coast halfway through Louisiana--one thing to \nnote about New Orleans that is still not quite understood is this river \nridge was the high part of the original city. As you know, before we \nhad concrete highways, the highways we built this Nation on were our \nrivers. So this city, being one of the oldest in the Nation, was built \non this river.\n  Amazingly and thankfully, the areas close to the river are not \nunderwater, which is this whole ridge. The French Quarter has stayed \npretty much high and dry, even the Lower Garden District. Some of the \npoorer areas along Tchoupitoulas Street are, thank God, out of the \nwater all along the river ridge. The west bank has been spared where we \nwant to build our Federal city complex. We now know it is a good place \nbecause it is a highland area and a good place to build.\n  But this entire city--eastern New Orleans, which is a middle-income \nneighborhood of White and Black citizens, as well as some poor, very \npoor; and the Lower Ninth Ward--this is where the Lower Ninth Ward is--\nGentilly, which is a middle-income neighborhood of Black and White \ncitizens; the Bywater neighborhood; Mid-City; Lakeview, which is \npredominantly White but very integrated in some parts and very high \nincome--is completely underwater. Then, of course, there is the midpart \nof the city, which is low.\n\n  So as our Senators come in, they will literally see what looks like \nNoah's Ark, looks like something of Biblical proportions. Maybe the \nwater will have gone down by Friday. They are pumping it out quite \nfast. But just to get some sense, the entire city--poor areas and \nwealthy areas--is underwater, as well as the east bank of Jefferson. \nSt. Bernard was still completely underwater the last time I flew over \nas well.\n  So our work is complicated by having banks and schools not \nfunctioning. Shown in this picture, in each one of these blocks--I know \nI only have 1 minute left--these are schools, these green dots. All of \nthese schools have 10 feet of water in them, every single green dot, \nexcept for the ones along the ridge. These are our courts. Most of our \ncourts are not able to function, city or Federal courts.\n  Our police stations are underwater, which is why some of our police \nwere not able to function as well as they would under normal \ncircumstances. But I am pleased to report, after hearing from Chief \nCompass today, not one commander of the New Orleans police force left \nhis post, even though 80 percent of them have lost their homes. Some of \nthem have lost their families. As the President said himself, first \nresponders have been victims themselves.\n  So I thought I would present that today, to say thank you to the \nSenators for organizing the trip. I know the Finance Committee is going \nto announce in just a few minutes some tax relief opportunities that \nSenator Grassley and Senator Baucus have worked out. I have worked with \nthem. Senator Vitter and others have worked to put that together. We \nare very pleased more help is on the way.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Cochran giving me the opportunity \nto speak for a few minutes about those points. I will try to get to the \nfloor sometime tomorrow for the same reason.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9898-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune).

The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is now able to \nreturn to the consideration of H.R. 2862, the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill.\n  This is the third day of consideration of this important bill. \nSubcommittee Chairman Shelby and the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, have made good progress in the handling of this \nbill. The bill reported by the committee will assure the funding of \nmany programs and activities of the Federal Government that are under \nthe jurisdiction of this subcommittee.\n  The allocation we made to this subcommittee enabled us to restore \nfunding for State and local law enforcement grants, as well as have \nincreased funding for programs of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. Because this bill is now at the upper limit of the \nsubcommittee's allocation, any amendments adopted to the bill will \nrequire reductions below the level of funding in other programs.\n  Now is the time for Senators to come to the floor to discuss the bill \nor offer amendments. It is my understanding from the leader that any \namendments requiring a rollcall vote will be voted on tomorrow. It is \nmy hope we can complete action on this bill tomorrow. The end of the \nfiscal year is near. We have the responsibility to send this bill to \nconference as soon as we can.\n  To remind Senators of the importance of completing action on this \nbill, this committee is one of those committees that was newly created \nafter the reorganization of the Appropriations Committee that was begun \nin the House of Representatives. We created this committee to manage \nthe funding for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, the National Science Foundation, and a number of \nindependent agencies and commissions, including the Office of the U.S. \nTrade Representative, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Small \nBusiness Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal \nCommunications Commission.\n  So all of the activities and programs and work of those agencies and \ndepartments are contained in this subcommittee's bill. It touches a \nwide range of interests and concerns, and it is very important for us \nto complete this bill as soon as we can so these agencies and \ndepartments can make their plans for activities that will be funded in \nthis bill at the beginning of the next fiscal year. That next fiscal \nyear starts October 1.\n  In September of every year, a lot of pressure is put on the \nappropriations process. In order for us to discharge our responsibility \nwith the administration, sharing with the administration decisions \nabout the emphasis that ought to be placed on programs and activities, \nwe have an obligation to do our work and to do it in a timely fashion. \nThat is why I come to the floor today with a sense of some urgency. I \nhope to communicate that to all of our colleagues in the Senate.\n  The House has completed action on most of its bills, and they are \nawaiting conference with the Senate to work out any differences or \ndisagreements that we may have with the House on the appropriate levels \nof funding or the categories of interest in terms of their priorities \nover others in the Federal Government.\n  This is a day when any votes that are going to occur will occur late \nin the day. I understand we have a vote in the Senate at 6:30 this \nevening. So I hope Senators will undertake to come and present us with \nany suggestions they may have about changes in this bill or any \ndisagreements in the policy reflected in the appropriations process in \nthis bill so we can debate them and discuss them and make changes, if \nthat is the will of the Senate, and then have an opportunity to \nnegotiate those changes on behalf of the Senate with our colleagues \nfrom the other body.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make available, from amounts otherwise available for the \n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration, $906,200,000 for \n     aeronautics research and development programs of the National \n                 Aeronautics and Space Administration)\n\n       On page 170, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 304. Of the amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this title under the heading ``National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration'', $906,200,000 shall be \n     available for aeronautics research and development programs \n     of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senators Allen, \nMurray, Warner, and Voinovich in an effort to maintain our Nation's \ncommitment to vital aeronautics research. We are offering this \namendment to restore the aeronautics research & development program to \nlast year's level of $906 million.\n  For decades, NASA has conducted a wide array of aeronautics research \nprograms that have helped ensure our economic and military security and \nrevolutionize the way we travel. NASA's work in aeronautics has \ncaptured the spirit of the Wright Brothers, spawning generation after \ngeneration of progress. The amendment before us will help make certain \nthat progress continues in the coming fiscal year.\n  The impact of NASA's work is widespread. The U.S. aviation industry \nsupports over 11 million jobs and contributes $1 trillion in economic \nactivity. Our airlines carry 750 million passengers per year, with that \nnumber expected to grow to a billion within 15 years. We ship 52 \npercent of our exports by air, and in fact, the aviation industry \ncontributes more to the U.S. balance of trade than any other domestic \nmanufacturing industry.\n  Yet unfortunately, we are at grave risk of losing the staff, \nfacilities, and expertise necessary to continue NASA's aeronautics \nprograms. We are at risk of essentially allowing the first ``A'' in \nNASA--the one that stands for aeronautics--to die over the next several \nyears. We are at risk and we better pay attention.\n  The bill we have before us now is a good bill, and I want to \ncongratulate Chairman Shelby and Ranking Member Mikulski on their hard \nwork in meeting so many needs with a very tough and tight budget \nallocation. One thing the bill does not include, however, is a specific \nreference to aeronautics funding.\n  Nonetheless, we know of NASA's plans for aeronautics from its fiscal \nyear 2006 budget request. We know that the agency intends to reduce \noverall aeronautics funding by $54 million from the previous year, a \ncut of over $200 million from 2004. In fact, the 2006 Budget shows \naeronautics programs facing a nearly one-third cut in the next 5 years \nfor aeronautics. That is simply not acceptable.\n  What will the practical consequences of these cuts be? The cuts mean \nthat subsonic and hypersonic research will\n\n[[Page S9900]]\n\nbe terminated. This is the research that focuses on designing stronger \nairframes and better engines, technologies that with just a little work \ncan be taken from the lab and applied directly to aircraft, whether \ncommercial or military. As a result, U.S. aerospace producers will lack \naccess to solid pre-competitive research, while competitors abroad \nbenefit from well financed efforts, such as the European Union's \n``Vision 2020'' program.\n  Second, many of the facilities necessary to design and test new \naeronautics technologies will be closed as a result of budget \nshortfalls. Wind tunnels and propulsion test facilities are used by \nGovernment, academia, and industry--often on a pay-for-use basis--and \nrequire minimal funding to maintain.\n  A recent RAND National Defense Research Institute study determined \nthat over 84 percent of these NASA facilities serve strategic national \nneeds, and that the success of the U.S. aerospace industry relies on \nNASA's workforce and test facility infrastructure.\n  So, these proposed aeronautics cuts are a double threat to the U.S. \naviation industry: On the one hand, they get NASA out of the business \nof key aeronautics research areas, and on the other, they will lead to \nthe closure of the very facilities industry and academia would need to \nreplace that research. The cuts undermine our national defense by \ndecimating cross-cutting technologies used by the Department of \nDefense. The cuts will force massive layoffs among NASA's best and \nbrightest engineers, and will also impact the scores of Americans \nworking for private sector aerospace companies. These cuts are simply \nunacceptable.\n  We need to step back and re-evaluate where we are with aeronautics \nresearch, where we want to be in 5, 10, 15 years, and make a commitment \nto do what it takes to get us there. A National Institute of Aerospace, \nNIA, study commissioned by Congress and unveiled earlier this year \nshows a need for vastly increased investment within NASA aeronautics \nprograms. Our amendment does not reach the levels recommended by the \nNIA report, but it does move us in the right direction, the same \ndirection that the House of Representatives has taken in its version of \nthis bill.\n  Our amendment follows directly from budget language adopted by the \nSenate this year calling for an adequate aeronautics investment. We do \nnot cut space exploration programs to make this increase. This is a \nclean, deficit-neutral amendment that will help ensure our national \ncompetitiveness in civil and military aerospace, and it deserves the \nSenate's support.\n  I will be back on the floor later to talk more about this amendment, \nas my other colleagues will, but at this point I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burr). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendments be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1660\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a congressional commission to examine the \n   Federal, State, and local response to the devastation wrought by \nHurricane Katrina in the Gulf Region of the United States especially in \nthe States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and other areas impacted \nin the aftermath and make immediate corrective measures to improve such \n                        responses in the future)\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I call up Senate amendment No. 1660, an \namendment establishing an independent Katrina commission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mrs. Clinton], for herself, Ms. \n     Stabenow, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Reed, Mr. Salazar, Mr. Lautenberg, \n     Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Schumer, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1660.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, September 8, \n2005 under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I hope we will be able to address this \nimportant matter. I believe it is essential for the people who have \nbeen directly affected along the Gulf Coast, and really for all \nAmericans, that we have an independent commission consisting of people \nwho have no direct involvement in either the administration or \ncongressional activities, similar to what we had with the 9/11 \nCommission that I believe discharged its responsibility to the American \npeople with such a high degree of civic-mindedness and public \ncitizenship.\n  When I was in Houston last Monday a week ago, I met with a number of \nthe people who had been evacuated out of New Orleans and the \nsurrounding parishes. They kept asking me questions I certainly could \nnot answer: What happened to the buses that were supposed to pick them \nup and take them out? Why wasn't there adequate security at the \nSuperdome or the convention center? How come helicopters were flying \noverhead and never coming to pick them up?\n  This morning I heard on the radio an interview with a gentleman who \nis the president of one of the parishes surrounding New Orleans. I \nbelieve his name is ``Junior'' Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriguez said he \ncouldn't get any help at all. He kept trying to get help and he kept \nwaiting for help and nothing happened.\n  This, as we know now, was a catastrophe of almost Biblical \nproportions for the people who suffered it: people who lost their \nhomes; people who were driven from their homes; the people who, most \ntragically, lost loved ones. Many are still searching for members of \ntheir family whom they have not been able to find since they got on a \nbus or left a home and waded through water.\n  I hope we will address this. I believe it is a matter that needs to \nbe taken out of politics as usual. I personally don't want members of \nthe administration whose primary obligation is to the people who have \nbeen directly affected, who need to be directing and managing the \nrelief efforts beginning the rebuilding process, being diverted from \ndoing so. I respectfully suggest the President's idea of investigating \nhimself is not an adequate recommendation.\n  Similarly, I do not believe Congress should be diverted. We have \ncommittees already established and their job is to assess and make \nrecommendations with respect to all of the matters pertaining to \nhomeland security, not only the potential of terrorist attacks but also \nnatural disasters. Therefore, I do believe in an investigation modeled \non the 9/11 Commission where the President--as in my legislation--\nappoints the Chair. He can appoint whomever he wishes. He certainly \nmade an excellent choice when he appointed former Governor of New \nJersey Tom Kean. Then the Democratic and Republican leaders appoint the \nother members, to have a 10-member Commission with the President and \nhis party obviously having an advantage, as is appropriate under the \ncircumstances, but appointing people for whom there is universal \nrespect and people who can set aside everything, people who are willing \nto delve into this and ask the hard questions about what happened at \nall levels of government, so we can get answers.\n  I think the people who have been evacuated, the people who have lost \nloved ones, the people who suffered deserve answers. But it is not just \nan exercise in looking backward. I think it is essential that we look \nforward. What the 9/11 Commission did was help focus our attention on \nwhat we should be doing, how we should be proceeding to be ready, \nprepared in the face of the ongoing threats from the terrorists.\n  Today we heard about an al-Qaida operative--we think it is some \ndisaffected American who has gone off and joined al-Qaida--who issued \nthe threat that specifically named Los Angeles. We need to be sure we \nare totally prepared. We have learned some things, but you can't learn \nenough unless you are honest enough and out of denial in order to\n\n[[Page S9901]]\n\nconduct a thorough investigation and let the chips fall where they may. \nLet's find answers. I hope we will have an opportunity to vote on this \namendment. I invite my friends and colleagues from the other side of \nthe aisle to join with us to support this independent Katrina \ncommission and to let us get about the business, on a very short \ntimetable, of getting answers we can all then implement.\n  I marked the fourth commemoration of what happened to New York on 9/\n11. I spent yesterday, as I have in past years, with the victims, with \nthe survivors, with family members, with members of the police and fire \ndepartments and emergency workers. I could not be more proud to \nrepresent such extraordinary, heroic people. But, in speaking \nespecially to our first responder community, they were shaken by this. \nWe needed Federal help. We did a heck of a job. We had the greatest \npolice force and fire department--I would say in the world, with not \njust pride but with a factual basis. We did a great job, but we needed \nhelp and we got help. But now, 4 years later, we are wondering whether \nthat help would be there if something were to happen to us. No city, no \nState should wonder that.\n  I think it is a boost of confidence for people to know we are moving \nas best we can to understand it, but we are unafraid to face whatever \nthe facts might be. That is why we need an independent commission \nconstituted as soon as possible, given the resources to do its work, \nand asked to report in as short a timeframe as possible.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to call up this amendment and I hope \nthere will be an opportunity to address it and that we will have a \nstrong vote on both sides of the aisle to proceed with this independent \ncommission as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the pending business is the Commerce, \nJustice, Science appropriations. As the Presiding Officer knows, I am \nthe ranking member. So our colleagues know, there are about 20 \noutstanding amendments. We are busy clearing those--Senator Shelby is \non his way to the Senate--that Senator Shelby and I could agree to, so \nwhen we do rollcall votes, we hope to have those reduced to a minimum, \nor at least a reasonable number. We will also be awaiting direction \nfrom the leadership, Senator Frist and Senator Reid, as to how we will \nproceed tomorrow on rollcall votes. We believe we have some that will \nbe ready tomorrow to move this very important bill expeditiously.\n  For those who might not know, this new subcommittee handles all the \nCommerce funding, it handles the funding for agencies such as NOAA, \nwhich was so great in telling Americans about the hurricane. It also \nhas a variety of provisions that would be very helpful to Katrina \nvictims, including small business disaster loans that are available not \nonly to business but particularly small business, as well as \nresidential homeowners, up to $200,000, EDA money, to help local \ncommunities rebuild, particularly infrastructure.\n  While we are mesmerized by the tragedy in New Orleans, we cannot \nforget Mississippi and Alabama and their needs for roads and other \ninfrastructure projects, including water supply.\n  The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, of course, of \nAlabama, and I want to move the bill. We understand our leadership, \nSenator Frist, is not going to have rollcall votes during the important \nRoberts hearings, so we will work with him to see how to do it. One of \nthe ways we will work with him is in how to reduce the number of \namendments. We are now waiting for our distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma, Senator Coburn, to join us. We know he has something to say \non the bill.\n  This is a new subcommittee that has been constituted. I used to be \nthe ranking member of a subcommittee that has been dissolved, VA/HUD \nand Independent Agencies. Under the ``independent agencies,'' was the \nimportant agency of FEMA. Now I understand the leadership of FEMA, Mr. \nBrown, has resigned. We look to the President to give us a topnotch \nperson. We know the vice admiral of the Coast Guard is now in the Gulf. \nWe look at leadership, such as the wonderful person running Red Cross, \nRADM Marty Evans, whom I knew when she was at the Naval Academy, one of \nthe first women in this country to make admiral rank. Then she went on \nto a distinguished career running nonprofits and is now with the Red \nCross, very much in the spirit and competency of our colleague from \nNorth Carolina, Senator Elizabeth Dole. We look forward to that \nleadership.\n  We need to focus now on two things: Recovery and reform. In moving \nour bill, we want to work on a bipartisan basis on recovery. There are \nthree Rs to emergency management: Readiness and preparedness; and then \nresponse, which needs to be swift and effective; third is recovery.\n  Recovery is tough. In my home State of Maryland, we have had \ntornadoes, we have been hit by Hurricane Isabel, when it looked like \nBaghdad on the Chesapeake Bay. In no way is this akin to what has \nhappened to our friends in the Gulf. But, still, when it is your house \nand your neighborhood, whether it is 3 blocks or 3,000 acres, we want \nto work with recovery and do it on a bipartisan basis.\n  It will take a lot, No. 1, of rebuilding infrastructure so business \nand people can come back. Things such as water supplies have been \ndamaged or contaminated. Roads and bridges need repair in order for \ncommerce to pass through.\n  What comes back? Business, such as the supermarket, or do they wait \nfor the people to come back? We have to be able to help rebuild those \ncommunities. We cannot do it without the help of the private sector.\n  I hope those running Homeland Security, as well as the President's \ngood office, would bring to bear the best of what we know from our home \nbuilding and construction agency on what we can do to marshal the \nforces for rebuilding homes and those neighborhoods, particularly the \nsmall business--everyone knows what I am talking about, the dry \ncleaner, the pharmacist, as well as the supermarkets, et cetera, that \nare lifeblood. We also will have to rebuild schools for our children, \nas well as coming back with their mom and dad into the safety of a new \nhome.\n  We also worry that while we are rebuilding the Gulf, and rebuild the \nGulf we must, we do not want to create shortages in other parts of \nother country. Lumber is already in short supply, along with other \nbuilding materials, even the talent, the electricians, plumbers, \ncontractors. That is why we need a national effort.\n  We hope those who are leading Homeland Security will now look at the \nrecovery phase while we go through the grim task of recovering bodies. \nWe have to recover ourselves. What we do not need to recover, though, \nbecause we have never lost it, is the spirit of working together and \nthe spirit that we will be able to do this.\n  It is September 12. I remember where we were 4 years ago on September \n11. Yesterday morning, when I got up to go to church, I had this eerie \nfeeling that the weather was exactly the way it was on September 11. \nWhen I went to church, I wore the jacket that I had on that day. I \nsaved that jacket so I would never ever forget what I wore and what I \nexperienced that day.\n  For all of the fear and all of the grief, I remember on the Capitol \nsteps we sang ``God Bless America.'' I stood shoulder to shoulder with \nSenator Lott that day, then as the Republican leader, and stand with \nhim today in terms of recovery of his own community. We have to get \nback to that spirit where we thought we could work together in this \ninstitution, in the House, and with the people.\n  On September 12, we want to honor, again, pay our respects to those \nwho were killed on September 11, to our wonderful first responders who \nrisked life and limb to save people. Now we are at it once again. For \nour first responders and our responders in the Gulf now, going through \nthat mercury-contaminated water, they each have their own risk.\n  They are counting on us to be able to work together, bring in the \nnational\n\n[[Page S9902]]\n\nresources and marshal the private sector resources, as well as the \nnonprofit resources, so that by the time we get to Thanksgiving we will \nhave been well on our way. So we look to be able to do that. We \nin Commerce, Justice, and Science look forward to doing our part, \ncarrying our heavy lifting. There is no lifting too heavy to help \npeople in our own country that have been so devastated.\n\n  For everyone working on this out there in the field, the tremendous \nnumber of volunteers, the generosity of spirit of the people and, I \nmight add, the private sector that is marshaling, we say thank you. We \nhave a big job to do. One of the big jobs we have to do is here, \nworking on a bipartisan basis, to be collegial, to be civil, and to get \nthe job done.\n  Let's ask of ourselves exactly what we ask the people working down in \nthe Gulf. Let's not have a slow, sluggish response from the Congress. \nLet's be effective in targeting our resources.\n  I have a long-range idea I would like to share on the idea of reform. \nWhen I was the chairman of VA/HUD, before the 1994 Republican Gingrich \nrevolution, I found that FEMA was a dated agency. It was focused on the \nCold War. It was worrying about where to send the Coast Guard if we had \na nuclear attack. It was riddled with staff at Federal and State \nlevels, with cronies and hacks and people with no experience in \nemergency management.\n  When Hurricane Andrew hit Florida with such enormous devastation, we \nfound Andrew people were doubly victimized. They were victimized by the \nhurricane, and then they were victimized by the inept approach of FEMA.\n  I went to work on reform. I worked with President Bush's dad--I call \nhim President Bush 1--and Andy Card, who is now the President's Chief \nof Staff, to reform FEMA. We did. Let me tell you we totally reformed \nFEMA. When President Clinton came in, he took that early work that we \nhad begun with President Bush 1.\n  What did we do? First, we said goodbye to the Cold War. The Cold War \nwas over, except for the Federal bureaucracy. We said goodbye to the \nCold War. We said that FEMA now had to be a professional agency; that \nit needed to be headed by someone who had either emergency management \nexperience, and actually responded to emergencies, or comparable \nexperience in the military or in private sector with crisis management. \nPresident Clinton gave us James Lee Witt.\n  Second, we encouraged Governors to do the same thing at the State \nlevel. The more they did, the more we could help.\n  Third, we said that FEMA had to become an all-hazards agency, it had \nto be ready for a hurricane or tornado. But in becoming ``all \nhazards,'' it had to go to the risk-based strategy. We analyzed what \nAmericans were most likely to have, particularly in terms of natural \ndisasters. It was tornadoes and hurricanes, followed of course by \nearthquakes, though less frequent, severe, and devastating. We then \nencouraged the States to have real plans for evacuation; that they had \nto be ready, they had to have things pre-positioned where things were \nmost likely to happen. If you were worried about hurricanes and \n``northeasters,'' you did not pre-position in Maryland from Allegany \nCounty, where we are subjected more to floods.\n  So, readiness and then recovery. Readiness, response, and recovery. \nIt worked very well.\n  After September 11, and our desire to be effective and supportive in \nfighting the global war against terrorism, FEMA was moved to Homeland \nSecurity. I supported that. I felt again that was the home of the first \nresponders. That was the home where the local fire departments could \napply for protective gear that firefighters needed.\n  I now have second thoughts because when FEMA moved to Homeland \nSecurity, it lost its focus, it lost its way, and it definitely lost \nits leadership. I believe the President will focus now on giving us the \nright leadership.\n  We have to get a new focus, and this is why I would like to see the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency again become an independent agency \nthat is an all-hazards agency, goes to the risks facing the American \npeople. There are natural disasters and there are terrorists. We cannot \nforget there are those who have a predatory intent against the United \nStates of America and its communities. So we have to be ready to \nrespond if they get through the fabulous intelligence network that we \nhave to protect us. We want to be ready for that.\n  Quite frankly, there are those who say: Well, Senator Mikulski, are \nyou saying we are going to worry more about tornadoes than terrorists? \nAbsolutely not. We have to be ready. But if you look at our cities and \nour larger communities, which are often the greatest targets of these \ninternational predators, these international thugs, these international \nterrorists, we have to be ready.\n  Just think, New Orleans could have been hit by a dirty bomb. New \nOrleans could have been hit by a chemical or biological attack. New \nOrleans could have been hit by bin Laden or Zarqawi or whomever, by \nblowing up the levees. So the consequences to the city--whether it is \nNew Orleans or Baltimore or a city in California or any city--would be \nthe same. We would have to be ready to respond, and to respond swiftly. \nThen, of course, we would have the recovery.\n  So if we have to evacuate the Capital region, it is the same whether \nwe are hit by some natural disaster or predatory attack. If we have to \nevacuate San Francisco or LA in California, it is the same. So the \nreform comes after the recovery. Right now, we have to be swift and \nsure in responding to the people who need us the most.\n  Mr. President, I note the Senator from Oklahoma has come to the \nfloor. I ask the Senator if he is prepared to speak?\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. Again, I reiterate my pledge \nfor bipartisan support on our recovery efforts. And I look forward to \nworking on a reform package with equal bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9902-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9902-S9908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MAKING APPROPRIATIONS FOR SCIENCE, THE DEPARTMENTS OF STATE, JUSTICE, \n   AND COMMERCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2006--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1648\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1648 on the CJS \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment No. 1648.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To eliminate the funding for the Advanced Technology Program \n    and increase the funding available for the National Oceanic and \n Atmospheric Administration, community oriented policing service, and \n              State and local law enforcement assistance)\n\n  On page 170, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n\n       Sec. 304.(a) Notwithstanding the provisions in title III \n     under the heading ``National Institute of Standards and \n     Technology'' and under the subheading ``industrial technology \n     services'', none of the funds appropriated in this Act may be \n     made available for the Advanced Technology Program of the \n     National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount made available in title III under the heading \n     ``National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration'' and under \n     the subheading ``operations, research, and facilities'' for \n     the National Weather Service is increased by $4,900,000 and, \n     of the total amount made available for such purpose under \n     such subheading, $3,950,000 shall be made available for the \n     Coastal and Inland Hurricane Monitoring and Prediction \n     Program and $3,950,000 shall be made available for the \n     Hurricane and Tornado Broadcast Campaign.\n       (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the \n     amount made appropriated in title I under the heading \n     ``Office of Justice Programs'' and under the subheading \n     ``community oriented policing services'' is increased by \n     $72,000,000 and, of the total amount made available under \n     such subheading, not less than $132,100,000 shall be made \n     available for the Methamphetamine Hot Spots program.\n       (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, the \n     amount made appropriated\n\n[[Page S9903]]\n\n     in title I under the heading ``Office of Justice Programs'' \n     and under the subheading ``state and local law enforcement \n     assistance'' is increased by $48,000,000 and, of the total \n     amount made available under such subheading, not less than \n     $578,000,000 shall be made available for the Justice \n     Assistance Grants program.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is an amendment to start us down the \nway of reprioritizing our spending in this country.\n  With the events of the last 2 weeks, the tremendous deficit we face \nalready, and the significant problems we face in this country, \nespecially in terms of methamphetamine, the Weather Service, and the \nByrne Justice Assistance Grants, this is an amendment that will \neliminate the Advanced Technology Program.\n  There is no question that the ATP has done some good in its history. \nIt has $140 million in budget authority and has, this year, $22.4 \nmillion in outlays. But there has come a time when we need to make \ndecisions. One of the things I have been consistent on in terms of my \ntime in the Senate is insisting that we start reprioritizing the things \nthat work and the things that do not work.\n  The Advanced Technology Program was scrutinized at a hearing of the \nFederal Financial Management Subcommittee of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee this year and had good testimony. I will \nnot demean some of the positive things that have come from this \nprogram. There is no question certain positive things have come from \nit.\n  However, GAO and the Comptroller General noted that 63 percent of the \nrequests for grants through ATP never sought funds anywhere else. ATP \nis supposed to be the source of last resort on technology.\n  I have put up a chart to show the American people who has actually \nbeen getting the funding. It has not been small businessmen. It has not \nbeen new ideas, innovation coming from small entrepreneurs. What it has \nbeen for is the major corporations in this country that have billions \nand billions and billions of dollars worth of sales every year, and \nbillions in profits. Yet we are now asking the American taxpayer to \ntake 30 to 40 percent of this ATP money and fund the likes of General \nElectric, IBM, Motorola, and 3M, just to name four.\n  The fact is, good ideas will usually get funded. There is venture \ncapital all across this country looking for good ideas, private capital \nthat will fund great ideas. In this time of fiscal constraint, it is \ntime we reprioritize what we do with this money.\n  This amendment is intended to take the savings from ATP and put it in \nthree different programs. One of the programs is the Byrne Justice \nAssistance Grants Program, which is markedly needed today in terms of \ndrug courts, in terms of drug busts, in terms of helping the district \nattorneys and State attorneys general accomplish the very laws we put \non the books in front of them.\n  It transfers funding to the COPS Methamphetamine Hot Spots Program. \nThere has never been a more devastating drug to our society than \nmethamphetamine. It is growing like wildfire. As a matter of fact, \nattached to this bill is a methamphetamine bill that limits and \nrestricts the sale of pseudoephedrine throughout this country. It is a \ncompromise worked out by many of us on the Judiciary Committee, along \nwith Senator Talent and Senator Feinstein, to put the brakes on the \naccessibility of pseudoephedrine in the manufacturing of \nmethamphetamine.\n  It also helps fund the National Weather Service for two hurricane and \ntornado monitoring and broadcast programs. Goodness knows, we need \nthat. Different outlay rates for the different programs result in only \n$124.9 million of the original $140 million being transferred.\n  In March, during debate over the budget resolution, Senator Levin \noffered an amendment supporting ATP. One of the reasons for that is \nlast year Michigan got $31 million out of the $140 million. I can \nunderstand his desire to support that. But I would also note that \nmethamphetamine is a growing epidemic in Michigan. Law enforcement and \nthe Hot Spots Program to fund the breaking down, the taking of children \nout of areas that have been exposed to this tremendously derelict drug \nthat is infecting and ruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans is important.\n  It is interesting to note that for every State in the United States, \nthe average funding from ATP has been less than funding for the Byrne \nJAG Program. The results of this will place $48 million additional into \nthe Byrne Justice Assistance Grants Program, $72 million into the COPS \nMethamphetamine Hot Spots Program, and $4.9 million into the National \nWeather Service.\n  It is interesting to note, also, that many of those who oppose this \nbill are the ones who seek and have received the most in terms of the \ngrants from the ATP program. If you look at California, where Senator \nFeinstein will be supporting this CJS bill, California actually \nreceived $31 million as an average from 1990 to 2004. However, with the \nByrne JAG Program being reduced, their average of $58 million for that \nprogram will be reduced.\n  ATP was created by Congress in 1988 to improve the global competitive \nposition of high-tech industries in the United States. Very few of the \nthings that came out of that ATP program accounted for the tremendous \nresurgence in the economic activities of the 1990s. Very few of the \nthings have come out of the ATP program, although there have been some. \nOne in Oklahoma in particular, Pure Protein, a company in my home \nState, had an ATP program. But they also have venture capital funding \nthat would have funded that research anyway.\n\n  Many of the program's most vocal supporters believe without Federal \nfunding provided by ATP, countless research projects would receive no \nmoney at all, and that ATP exists to remedy the failure of the market \nto fund research and development. There is no evidence, however, that \nwould support those claims.\n  Time after time, ATP has been shown to fund initiatives that have \nalready been undertaken by the private sector. Year after year, \nmultibillion-dollar corporations, as noted here, receive millions of \ndollars from ATP.\n  Regarding the claim that ATP primarily funds research that does not \nalready exist in the private sector, the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice found in a 2000 report ATP-funded research on handwriting \nrecognition that began in the private sector in 1950. GAO found that \ninherent factors within ATP made it unlikely that ATP--and this is a \nquote--``can avoid funding research already being pursued by the \nprivate sector in the same time period.''\n  A 2002 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that ATP \nlaunched major efforts to fund Internet tools companies during periods \nwhen venture funding was markedly increasing its flow to these sectors. \nFurthermore, according to a program assessment and rating tool used by \nthe Office of Management and Budget, ATP does not address a specific \nneed and is not designed to make a unique contribution.\n  The Byrne Justice Assistance Grants, through the Edward Byrne \nMemorial Justice Assistance Grants, the Bureau of Justice Assistance \nprovides leadership and guidance on crime control and violence \nprevention and works in partnership with State and local governments to \nmake communities safe and improve the criminal justice system. The JAG \nProgram was created in 2004 through the merger of two Federal grant \nprograms, the Edward Byrne Memorial Drug Control and System Improvement \nGrant Program and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program. The \nJAG Program allows States and local governments to support a broad \nrange of activities to prevent and control crime and to improve the \ncriminal justice system.\n  The program focuses specifically on six separate purpose areas: law \nenforcement programs; prosecution and court programs; prevention and \neducational programs; correction and community correction programs; \ndrug treatment programs; planning, evaluation, and technology \nimprovement.\n  I want to tell you, as a physician, incarceration does not solve drug \naddiction. It makes it worse. Drug treatment programs solve drug \naddictions. If we are going to cut the money going to drug treatment \nprograms, we are making a vital mistake, a mistake we will pay \nadditional dollars for in the years to come.\n\n[[Page S9904]]\n\n  The procedure for allocating JAG funds is a formula based on \npopulation and crime statistics in combination with the minimum \nallocation to ensure that each State and territory receives an \nappropriate share.\n  Traditionally, under the Byrne formula and LLEBG Program, funds were \ndistributed 60-40 between State and local recipients. This distribution \ncontinues under the JAG Program.\n  The community-oriented policing services' Methamphetamine Hot Spots \nProgram address a broad array of law enforcement initiatives pertaining \nto the investigation of methamphetamine trafficking in heavily affected \nareas of the country. This is the largest growing area of drug abuse in \nour country. It has a tremendous impact not only on the drug user but \non their families because of the danger associated with it. We have \nseen a marked increase of infants who are delivered whose mothers are \naddicted to methamphetamine with tremendous negative consequences.\n  Earlier this year, 53 State attorneys general, including American \nSamoa and North Mariana Islands and District of Columbia, signed a \nletter to congressional leadership asking us not to reduce the funding \nfor the Byrne Jag and COPS Program. The letter asked Congress to \nrestore the reductions in these law enforcement programs to a level \nthat allows the States to build on the results of the past, law \nenforcement partnerships represented by the Byrne JAG and COPS \nPrograms. I will not go into the National Weather Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na fact sheet on Ohio, an article by the Cleveland Plain Dealer on the \nmeth epidemic striking Ohio, a fact sheet on Virginia, and a fact sheet \non Minnesota.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Ohio Fact Sheet--Coburn Amendment #1648 to H.R. 2862\n\n       This amendment eliminates funding for the Advanced \n     Technology Program (ATP) and shifts the funding to three \n     separate programs: Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (JAG), \n     Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and the National \n     Weather Service (NWS).\n       Specifically, funding for ATP is reduced by $140 million, \n     funding for JAG is increased by $48 million, funding for \n     COPS/Methamphetamine Hot Spots is increased by $72 million, \n     and funding for NWS is increased by $4.9 million.\n       Since 1990, ATP has funneled more than $700 million to \n     Fortune 500 companies that do not require government \n     assistance. For example, GE (revenues of $152 billion in \n     2004) has received $91 million from ATP, IBM (revenues of $96 \n     billion in 2004) has received $126 million from ATP, and \n     Motorola (revenues of $31 billion in 2004) has received $44 \n     million from ATP since 1990.\n       Since 1990, Ohio has received an average of $6.1 million \n     from ATP each year. In fiscal year 2005, Ohio received $15.5 \n     million from Byrne JAG funding alone.\n       Even though ATP was created to fund research that cannot \n     attract private financing, a Government Accountability Office \n     study found that 63 percent of ATP grant recipients never \n     even sought private financing. Quite simply, ATP funnels \n     taxpayer money to billion dollar corporations that do not \n     need government subsidies for research and development.\n       The National Association of Attorneys General, National \n     District Attorneys Association, National Narcotics Officers \n     Association Coalition, and National Sheriffs Association have \n     all expressed support for the Coburn amendment.\n       Earlier this year, Jim Pero, the Attorney General of Ohio, \n     co-signed a letter to Congressional leadership stating that \n     funding cuts for law enforcement grants ``will devastate \n     state law enforcement efforts--especially drug enforcement--\n     if they are not restored.'' In the absence of this amendment, \n     Byrne JAG funding will be cut by $6.5 million relative to \n     2005 levels.\n       An August 2005 news article in The Plain Dealer, a \n     newspaper in Cleveland, states, ``A scourge on the West Coast \n     for nearly two decades, methamphetamine has established a \n     destructive toehold in Ohio, infecting rural outposts, big \n     cities and middle-class suburbs and consuming thousands of \n     lives.''\n       A July 2005 survey of law enforcement agencies conducted by \n     the National Association of Counties found that ``Meth is the \n     leading drug-related local law enforcement problem in the \n     country.''\n       According to the same survey, 70 percent of responding \n     officials stated that other crimes, including robberies and \n     burglaries, had increased because of methamphetamine use.\n       The Methamphetamine Hot Spots program, part of COPS, \n     addresses a broad array of law enforcement initiatives \n     pertaining to the investigation of methamphetamine use and \n     trafficking, trains law enforcement officials, collects \n     intelligence, and works to discover, interdict, and dismantle \n     clandestine drug laboratories. This amendment would ensure \n     that this program receives the funding it needs to tackle the \n     serious problems associated with methamphetamine use and \n     distribution.\n       This amendment also increases funding for the National \n     Weather Service, and directs the additional funding towards \n     the Inland and Coastal Hurricane Monitoring and Prediction \n     program and the Hurricane and Tornado Broadcast Campaign.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Plain Dealer, Aug. 7, 2005.]\n\n                       Meth Epidemic Strikes Ohio\n\n                          (By Mark Gillispie)\n\n       A scourge on the West Coast for nearly two decades, \n     methamphetamine has established a destructive toehold in \n     Ohio, infecting rural outposts, big cities and middle-class \n     suburbs and consuming thousands of lives.\n       Like moonshine, but far more addictive, methamphetamine is \n     a home-cooked concoction that can be brewed in kitchens, \n     hotel rooms, back yards and trunks of cars.\n       And its destructive surge eastward--reinvigorated by \n     Mexican drug cartels--has been driven largely by waves of \n     hometown cooks, who pass the finished drug and their favorite \n     recipes to family, friends and customers. In Summit County, a \n     now-entrenched culture of meth-cooking has been traced to one \n     woman--Debra Oviatt--who has spent the last eight years in \n     prison but is still known today as Akron's ``Mother of \n     Meth.''\n       ``There's no doubt in my mind that Debbie got the whole \n     thing started,'' said Larry Limbert, a retired narcotics \n     detective with the Summit County Sheriff's Office.\n       Summit County has since become Ohio's meth capital. \n     Narcotics officers dismantled 104 labs there last year--far \n     more than in any other county--and are on pace to exceed that \n     total this year. Common wisdom in law enforcement holds that \n     for every one lab busted, 10 remain undiscovered.\n       Nationally, the number of labs and other meth sites found \n     last year topped 17,000, according to federal statistics, up \n     from just 327 a decade ago.\n       As authorities in dozens of states try to shut down local \n     cooks, evidence is mounting that ``ice,'' a more potent form \n     of meth, is being shipped in from Mexico and California to \n     fill entrenched demand. In Summit County, meanwhile, \n     officials say the Department of Children Services has removed \n     dozens of children from homes where parents cooked and used \n     meth in recent years. One-third of juveniles enrolled in a \n     Summit County drug-court program reported having tried the \n     drug, also commonly known as ``crank,'' ``crystal,'' \n     ``speed'' and ``tweek.''\n       The number of methamphetamine users who sought help at \n     Oriana House, a drug-treatment organization in Summit County, \n     jumped from 30 in 2001 to 386 last year.\n       ``There's definitely something going on out there,'' said \n     Oriana executive vice president Bernie Rochford.\n       Police and narcotics agents in Lake County have found 15 \n     labs since September but only a handful before then. Portage \n     County has dismantled at least five labs since April.\n       Police in Ashtabula County have been finding nearly one lab \n     a week. The Children's Services agency there has had to close \n     an adolescent group home and shift resources to pay for the \n     care of children removed from parents who cook and abuse \n     meth.\n       Methamphetamine use also is rising in Cleveland and its \n     suburbs, where the drug had been confined mostly to gay bars, \n     bath houses and strip clubs, says Lt. Michael Jackson of the \n     Cuyahoga County Sheriffs Office. Experts predict the problem \n     will get worse before it gets better.\n       ``You've heard about crack, you've heard about heroin,'' \n     said Akron police Lt. Mike Caprez. ``I've seen all those \n     things take their course, and this has them both beat.'' Like \n     crack in some ways, meth is more dangerous.\n       Like crack in some ways, meth is more dangerous.\n       Comparing meth to crack cocaine is apt on a number of \n     levels.\n       Both are stimulants. Both are highly addictive.\n       While methamphetamine can be snorted, injected or eaten, \n     more than half of those who sought treatment for meth \n     addiction in 2003 said they smoked the drug--which is how \n     crack is ingested.\n       Smoking meth produces the same strong, instantaneous \n     ``rush'' that crack smokers achieve.\n       Methamphetamine floods the pleasure centers of the brain \n     with large amounts of the neurotransmitter dopamine. It also \n     affects other body chemicals that govern sleep, thirst, \n     hunger and sex drive, making a person feel energetic, wakeful \n     and hypersexual.\n       But meth remains in the body 10 times longer than crack, \n     which can make meth cheaper to use. And while crack is \n     obviously dangerous, methamphetamine causes even more \n     physical harm.\n       A strong neurotoxin, methamphetamine damages the brain and \n     other vital organs in a way that crack does not. And \n     recovery, while possible, can be more difficult and take \n     longer.\n       It can take several years of abstinence before meth \n     addicts' body chemistry straightens out and they can feel \n     ``normal'' again. Early studies show some of the brain damage \n     is reversible.\n       The drug also rots teeth, a condition known as ``meth \n     mouth.'' Users develop ugly sores caused by incessant picking \n     and scratching at phantom ``crank bugs'' they feel under \n     their skin.\n\n[[Page S9905]]\n\n       And when the dopamine ``buzz'' wears off, meth users are \n     left wide awake for hours on end feeling angry and depressed.\n       The quick fix is more meth, which can trigger a vicious \n     cycle of addiction. Hard-core meth users, known as \n     ``tweekers,'' sometimes go days, even weeks, without sleep.\n       That's when they become especially dangerous to themselves \n     and others. Meth-driven psychosis--chiefly paranoia and \n     hallucinations--combined with severe sleep deprivation can \n     result in bizarre and violent behavior. James Trimble's \n     attorney has claimed in court filings that his client was in \n     the throes of methinduced psychosis when he killed three \n     people in Portage County's Brimfield Township in January.\n       Because it is cheaper to use than crack, and because some \n     start using it for reasons other than getting high, meth has \n     also had a broader appeal among potential abusers.\n       Women, who abuse meth at about the same rate as men, often \n     report that they began using the drug to lose weight.\n       Blue-collar and construction workers use methamphetamine \n     for an energy boost to get them through long days of hard \n     labor.\n       An epidemiologist recently reported that in North Carolina, \n     hunters and fishermen are using meth to stay awake.\n       Gay men everywhere use meth for its ability to enhance sex. \n     Stepped-up meth use is being blamed for dramatic recent \n     increases in infection rates for HIV and other sexually \n     transmitted diseases.\n       ``There isn't a specific demographic that I associate with \n     meth,'' said Dr. Alex Stalcup, a drug treatment specialist in \n     San Francisco. ``It's essentially a universal drug.'' Three \n     abusers: three different stories.\n       Three abusers: Three different stories.\n       Margaret, 27, of Summit County, felt self-conscious about \n     her weight after giving birth to her second child. Her \n     boyfriend coaxed her into trying meth two years ago as she \n     did the laundry at their apartment in Mogadore.\n       ``I remember I felt like my eyeballs were going to come out \n     of my head, it burned so bad,'' Margaret said. ``But then, I \n     had all of this energy. So much energy I didn't know what to \n     do.''\n       She said she stayed up for five days straight, calling off \n     work, scouring and scrubbing virtually every inch of her \n     apartment.\n       ``I loved to clean when I was on it,'' she said.\n       She did indeed lose weight. But then she lost her job, and, \n     because of bad luck, a vengeful boyfriend and the bag of meth \n     police found in her purse, she lost custody of her two \n     children, too.\n       Margaret is now in a community-based corrections facility \n     in Akron working to put her life back together.\n       ``I can't believe I let this happen to me,'' she said.\n       Chad, a 20-year-old recovering addict, said he became \n     instantly addicted to meth after someone gave him a few lines \n     to snort at the Streetsboro manufacturing plant where he \n     worked. He said many of his coworkers used meth to endure the \n     grind of 12-hour days on the factory floor.\n       ``That was my excuse, to get through the shift,'' Chad \n     said.\n       Max, 34, of Cleveland, said he and numerous gay men he had \n     sex with in West Side bath houses would use meth. Most \n     preferred not to use condoms, he said, and few asked him \n     about his HIV status. He is positive.\n       Max said he has been drug-free since April, when he and \n     other members of a group calling itself the ``Gay Mafia'' \n     were arrested in a sweeping methamphetamine bust. Federal \n     authorities say the group sold meth brought here from \n     Phoenix.\n       ``Had I not gotten busted, I would still be doing it,'' Max \n     acknowledged. ``I don't think there's anything wrong with \n     it.''\n       While crack use increased rapidly, peaked in the late 1980s \n     and then fell off as people became wary of its effects, meth \n     use has been rising steadily.\n       From 1993 to 2003, the number of people seeking treatment \n     for meth addiction jumped five-fold.\n       Also in 2003, 14 states reported that more people entered \n     treatment for methamphetamine than for cocaine and heroin \n     combined. A survey that year estimated that more than 600,000 \n     people recently used meth, about the same number as used \n     crack. But experts now believe that meth use has exceeded \n     crack.\n       Unlike crack, methamphetamine--often referred to as ``poor \n     man's cocaine''--has swept through rural communities across \n     the country, including in southern Ohio.\n       But it has long been popular in big cities as well, \n     especially out west, where places like San Diego, Phoenix and \n     Portland, Ore., report high rates of meth addiction.\n       Police in Los Angeles say meth has become that city's No. 1 \n     drug.\n       And police in other western states say methamphetamine is \n     not only their top drug concern, it's their top crime problem \n     as well.\n       Walt Myers, the recently retired police chief in Salem, \n     Ore., said meth use drives at least 85 percent of the crime \n     in that city. Police in Tucson, Ariz., attribute dramatic \n     recent jumps in thefts and burglaries to a worsening \n     methamphetamine problem.\n       And identity theft is emerging in many communities as a \n     crime of choice among meth addicts.\n       Bob Brown of the Colorado Bureau of Criminal Investigation \n     said his agency has investigated numerous rings of meth users \n     producing high-quality counterfeit checks and identification \n     cards.\n       ``They don't sleep and they're high,'' Brown said of the \n     meth-driven counterfeiters. ``They're staying up late at \n     night when the rest of us are sleeping, and they're cranking \n     this stuff out.''\n       Nearly 60 percent of county sheriffs said in a recent \n     national survey that the meth epidemic is their worst drug \n     problem--three times the number mentioning cocaine.\n       ``It's not like the crack epidemic,'' said Richard Rawson, \n     a drug treatment expert at UCLA. ``It's not a flare-up and \n     flame-out. It's a gradual infestation and it stays there. \n     That's not a very positive perspective on the future.''\n       The making of Summit's Mother of Meth'.\n       The infestation in Akron can be traced to when Debra Oviatt \n     returned to Ohio a second time from California, bringing \n     along her favorite recipe for home-cooked meth.\n       Oviatt, 52, grew up in Wadsworth but moved as a young adult \n     to California, where she was arrested numerous times for auto \n     theft and was sentenced twice to prison.\n       She returned to Ohio after being paroled in 1986 and \n     apparently brought a meth habit with her.\n       Postal inspectors arrested her in 1991 after a package \n     containing methamphetamine was mailed from California to her \n     brother-in-law's home in Richfield. Oviatt received six \n     months in state prison.\n       She fled to California three years later when one of her \n     customers was arrested after a 3-ounce package of meth was \n     sent to his home.\n       When she came back to the Akron area in 1996, Oviatt \n     brought with her a deadly legacy: the ability to make her own \n     meth and a willingness to pass on the recipe.\n       Methamphetamine is manufactured using a witch's brew of \n     solvents and chemicals to change the molecular structure of \n     pseudoephedrine, the active ingredient in popular over-the-\n     counter cold remedies such as Sudafed and Actifed.\n       Meth labs are typically lowtech affairs. The tools of the \n     trade--glass jars, plastic soda bottles, coffee filters and \n     aquarium hoses--can fit inside a typical suitcase. The \n     flammable and combustible nature of the ingredients makes the \n     process potentially dangerous, but not difficult to learn.\n       ``There's definitely a science in making it, but it's not \n     rocket science,'' said Michael Fox, a drug counselor with the \n     Community Health Center of Akron. ``With a little bit of \n     training, anybody can make it.''\n       Meth cooks typically attract a small coterie of friends and \n     addicts who gather ingredients, such as cold pills, in \n     exchange for a share of the finished product.\n       When those friends and addicts learn the recipe themselves, \n     they often form their own co-operatives, which leads to more \n     cooking, more drugs and more addiction.\n       That's essentially what happened with Oviatt, authorities \n     say. And the result was a dramatic increase in meth abuse in \n     southern Summit County.\n       How many people she eventually taught to make the drug is \n     in dispute.\n       Although she declined twice to be interviewed, Oviatt \n     claimed in a letter to have taught only two. Police think \n     it's many more.\n       Among her students, they say, was Oviatt's son, Christopher \n     Shrake, who is serving a second prison sentence for meth \n     manufacturing.\n       Legendary cook undaunted by charges.\n       It was Shrake's carelessness that led to the discovery of \n     Summit County's first known methamphetamine lab nearly 10 \n     years ago.\n       About 7:30 a.m. on May 5, 1996, the Green Fire Department \n     got a call about a fire at a home on East Turkeyfoot Road. \n     Shrake apparently started the fire while mishandling some of \n     the ingredients.\n       The home sustained extensive damage. Firefighters' initial \n     suspicions were confirmed when members of a Summit County \n     drug unit arrived and revealed that they had been \n     investigating reports of a meth lab in the home.\n       A Summit County grand jury indicted Oviatt and Shrake. But \n     that didn't slow Oviatt down.\n       Police say that after a friend made and sold enough meth to \n     post her bail, Oviatt set up a shifting string of labs in \n     people's homes and in hotels along Interstate 77.\n       Detectives said Oviatt sometimes enlisted the help of her \n     6-year-old daughter to scrape methamphetamine residue from \n     filters, telling her it was bird seed.\n       Oviatt initially was selective about whom she taught, \n     sometimes sharing only a portion of the recipe in exchange \n     for cash or meth-making ingredients, a former student said. \n     That changed when it was clear she was headed to prison.\n       ``Debbie wanted to teach anybody and everybody so this town \n     would be flooded and nobody would make any money,'' the \n     student said.\n       Before she could settle the charges from the Green \n     incident, Oviatt was arrested in August 1996 at a hotel in \n     Wadsworth.\n       Police, who had been called because of a fight between \n     Shrake and his girlfriend, found methlab components in \n     Oviatt's room.\n       Oviatt agreed to a plea deal on charges from both arrests. \n     But before sentencing, she fled in February 1997 with the 6-\n     year-old and a pregnant 16-year-old daughter.\n       Detectives spent five months chasing her around Ohio, West \n     Virginia and Pennsylvania.\n       ``She bounced from apartment house to apartment house, \n     hotel to hotel,'' said Limbert, the retired detective. ``They \n     would\n\n[[Page S9906]]\n\n     make enough dope in those places that they would be OK.''\n       Oviatt's meth-cooking career ended on June 22, 1997. That's \n     when her younger daughter called 9-1-1 from a hotel in \n     Springfield Township and asked to speak with Limbert and \n     Detective Bruce Berlin. Oviatt, who had left the hotel, was \n     arrested later that evening.\n       She pleaded guilty to various charges, including \n     racketeering and kidnapping, and received a 2-year sentence.\n       Police believe that by the time she went to prison, dozens \n     of others had learned how to make methamphetamine, either \n     directly from Oviatt or from one of her students.\n       South Akron is hotbed for meth\n       Oviatt and her proteges helped make mostly white, blue-\n     collar Akron neighborhoods like Kenmore and Firestone Park--\n     along with nearby Barberton and Springfield Township--the \n     epicenter of meth making in Summit County.\n       It's in that general area that most of Summit County's meth \n     labs have been found, including a would-be meth school \n     operated by Brian Matheny, who police believe learned and \n     improved on Oviatt's recipe.\n       A nurse by training, Matheny set up a lab in the basement \n     of his Kenmore home, selling meth to support a substantial \n     heroin habit.\n       Using a camera he had received for Christmas, he made an \n     instructional video on meth manufacturing.\n       Police found the tape during a search of the basement in \n     September 1997.\n       It shows Matheny coughing and exhaling hydrochloric gas, \n     which is used in one step of the cooking process.\n       Penny Bishop, 43, got hooked on meth about the same time, \n     and in the same general neighborhood, and eventually learned \n     to cook as well--out of economic necessity.\n       Bishop says a friend introduced her to the drug in 1997, \n     and she liked it immediately. In about two months, her habit \n     grew from $100 a week to $400 as she switched from eating \n     meth to smoking it.\n       ``I had to have it just to get out of bed,'' Bishop said. \n     ``If I didn't have it, I wasn't moving.''\n       Bishop depended on the drug to allow her to work long hours \n     managing a gasoline station. But when her habit quickly \n     exceeded her salary, the friend who first sold her meth began \n     giving her money to buy cold pills.\n       She started shoplifting the pills so she could keep the \n     cash and, as many meth addicts do, learned to make the drug \n     herself.\n       Bishop, a high school dropout, said she caught on quickly.\n       ``It was amazing I could take all these chemicals and make \n     a drug, but I can't grasp simple things to get my GED,'' \n     Bishop said.\n       By the late 1990s, many stores had begun limiting how many \n     boxes of cold pills a person could buy at one time. (It takes \n     about 1,100 standard-strength pills to make a 1-ounce batch \n     of meth, roughly 280 doses.)\n       Meth cooks have generally sidestepped such measures by \n     sending out groups of people to buy cold pills from as many \n     stores as necessary to acquire the amount needed for the next \n     batch.\n       Laws cripple cooks, but meth keeps coming. But in the last \n     two years, authorities have gotten more aggressive in trying \n     to squeeze the cooks.\n       About 40 states have passed laws to restrict the sale of \n     pseudoephedrine products or are considering them.\n       In Ohio, legislators are considering a bill that would \n     restrict sales of pseudoephedrine products.\n       The Oregon legislature agreed last month to make it a \n     prescription drug. And Congress is considering a bill that \n     would follow Oklahoma's lead by requiring buyers of the pills \n     to show identification and sign a log book.\n       A number of national retailers have voluntarily moved cold \n     tablets to more-secure areas of their stores. And drug \n     manufacturers are gearing up production of cold pills that \n     contain phenylephrine--which cannot easily be converted into \n     meth--instead of pseudoephedrine.\n       Since Oklahoma's pioneering law took effect last year, \n     methlab seizures there have plummeted.\n       But not all the news is good. Narcotics detectives say \n     there is more meth than ever in Oklahoma. And the quality is \n     better.\n       With local cooks being shut down, the state's entrenched \n     meth demand is now being met by Mexican narcotraficantes who \n     have stepped up production, mostly south of the border, to \n     supply a growing U.S. market.\n       Seizures of ``ice''--the nearly pure form of meth churned \n     out in Mexican super labs--have jumped nearly five fold in \n     Oklahoma since its pseudoephedrine law took effect in April \n     2004.\n       Ice, which resembles shards of glass, ``is like meth on \n     rocket fuel,'' said Mark Woodward, a spokesman for the \n     Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.\n       Because of its purity and strength, he said, it's more \n     addictive and more dangerous than the home-cooked meth it's \n     replacing.\n       As long as the demand for meth highs persists, the future \n     does not look bright. There are no signs that meth use is \n     dropping in the West, Midwest or Southeast--areas of the \n     country where meth use has become entrenched.\n       More Californians were treated for methamphetamine \n     addiction than alcoholism in 2003. And meth has started to \n     make inroads into Pennsylvania, Maryland and rural \n     communities of New York--the outskirts of the Northeast \n     Corridor, which is home to 60 million people, one-fifth of \n     the U.S. population.\n       Vermont and Maine have been bracing for an upswing in meth \n     use and manufacturing. Two labs were recently found in \n     Connecticut.\n       ``Their numbers [of meth users] are going to go up,'' said \n     Special Agent Michael Heald, a methamphetamine expert with \n     the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\n       Heald acknowledged that law enforcement's ability to stop \n     the eastward surge of meth is limited. Prevention and \n     treatment, he said, are the best weapons in this particular \n     battle in the war on drugs.\n       ``Until we teach people that drugs are absolutely \n     destructive to ourselves and society, we can arrest all the \n     people we can'' and still not win, Heald said.\n       ``We can't do this alone.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Virginia Fact Sheet--Coburn Amendment #1648 to H.R. 2862\n\n       This amendment eliminates funding for the Advanced \n     Technology Program (ATP) and shifts the funding to three \n     separate programs: Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (JAG), \n     Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), and the National \n     Weather Service (NWS).\n       Specifically, funding for ATP is reduced by $140 million, \n     funding for JAG is increased by $48 million, funding for \n     COPS/Methamphetamine Hot Spots is increased by $72 million, \n     and funding for NWS is increased by $4.9 million.\n       Since 1990, ATP has funneled more than $700 million to \n     Fortune 500 companies that do not require government \n     assistance.

This is an area where there will be some controversy. I \ndon't know if we will win the vote on this amendment. If we start \nlooking at the human faces of what we, as Government, can do versus \nwhat business on its own can do and venture capital on its own can do, \nwhat we will see is that our parochialism needs to stop in terms of \nbenefits to limited numbers, and we need to increase benefits to the \nmasses. What I am asking by this grant is to eliminate a program that \nis marginal at best and put the money where it is going to make a \ntremendous difference in people's lives, born and unborn. It is my hope \nthe Senate will concur with the amendment and that we can have a \nbipartisan vote to do it. It is also my hope that this is the first of \nmany amendments, as we continue the appropriations process, where we \nwill start making the hard choices--not easy, not black and white, but \ngray--that are necessary for us to meet the growing needs of the \nFederal Government in this time of tremendous tragedy along our gulf \ncoast and in a time of tragedy for our budget.\n  It is my hope we won't vote this based on what we feel our own State \ngets but what is best for the country and how we move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1668\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of my \namendment that would allocate $2 million for methamphetamine education \nprograms in our Nation's schools. I am very pleased that this measure \nhas been included in the underlying bill, and I would like to take a \nmoment to explain why this amendment is so important.\n  Over the August recess I traveled throughout New Mexico to discuss \nthe challenges local communities are facing in confronting problems \nassociated with meth. I met with law enforcement, health officials, \nprosecutors, citizens, and State and local representatives. At each \nplace I visited--Moriarty, Roswell, Farmington, Belen, Santa Fe, Taos, \nand Albuquerque--the message was clear: methamphetamine is the most \nserious drug threat that we are facing and we must do more to fight the \nspread of this epidemic.\n  Indeed, the National Association of Counties recently released a \nreport that found that 58 percent of counties surveyed viewed meth as \ntheir largest drug problem, and 70 percent of law enforcement reported \nthat robberies and burglaries have substantially increased due to meth \nuse in their communities. And according to the DEA, there were some \n16,000 meth lab seizures last year, up from 912 in 1995. In New Mexico, \nthe number of labs seized increased fivefold from 1998 to 2003. The \ndrug is particularly harmful because of its impact on the user, the \nlikelihood of exposure to chemicals during the drug production process, \nand the high cleanup costs associated with dismantling labs.\n  We must address this issue in a comprehensive manner by reducing \ndomestic production, providing law enforcement with the tools they need \nto fight the meth epidemic, disrupting the importation of meth or its \nprecursor chemicals into the United States, and by developing effective \neducation and treatment programs.\n  With regard to limiting domestic production, I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the Combat Meth Act, which was introduced by Senators \nTalent and Feinstein, and included in the CJS appropriations bill. The \nbill would curb production by moving pseudoephedrine, the primary \ningredient in meth and a common ingredient in cold medicines, behind \nthe pharmacy counter. After Oklahoma enacted a similar law meth \nproduction dropped by over 80 percent in 1 year. The bill also provides \nadditional funding for law enforcement and creates a research and \ntraining center aimed at developing effective treatments for meth \nusers.\n  I am also pleased that the CJS appropriations bill provides funding \nfor the COPS meth program to assist local law enforcement obtain the \nequipment they need to safely and effectively clean up meth labs. I was \nvery disappointed that the President proposed cutting the total COPS \nprogram by 96 percent and the meth portion of the program by 62 \npercent. Fortunately, the Appropriations Committee rejected the \nadministration's proposal and included over $60 million for the COPS \nmeth program, which is about $5 million more than last year. Since \n1994, New Mexico has received over $68 million in COPS grants and more \nthan $860,000 specifically under the COPS meth program. The \nadministration also proposed cutting the HIDT A program by more than 50 \npercent, from $226 million to $100 million. These cuts, if enacted, \nwould have significantly impacted our ability to fight the importation \nof meth from countries such as Mexico. Thankfully the Senate rejected \nthis proposal as well.\n\n  However, I believe that we should also be focusing more on prevention \nby educating youth on the dangers of using meth. Along with enhanced \nlaw enforcement, prevention and education are key to combating meth. My \namendment would provide funding for grants to law enforcement and \nhealth and school officials to carry out meth education prevention \nefforts in schools across the country. This funding could be used by \nlocal officials to tailor curriculum to the needs of their local \ncomminutes and purchase the materials they need to educate youth on the \ndangers of meth.\n  According to ONDCP, there is a 95-percent chance that a first-time \nmeth user will become addicted. Once kids get addicted there aren't a \nlot of treatment options and they often face tough criminal sanctions \nfor using the drug. We need to emphasize education prevention efforts \nso we can stop people from going down a hard-to-reverse path riddled \nwith crime and devastating health effects.\n  Because the consequences of meth use are so visibly evident, such as \nrotting teeth and open sores, students will likely be more receptive to \nsuch information than with other drugs, such as marijuana, that are \nnormally the target of drug education prevention efforts in schools. \nThe ingredients used in the production of meth, such as battery acid, \nantifreeze, kitty litter, lithium batteries, also create an opportunity \nto make children understand the dangerous nature of this drug.\n  According to a report issued this month by the Substance Abuse and \nMetal Health Services Administratior, SAMHSA, there were 583,000 \ncurrent users of meth in 2004 aud 1.4 million persons ages 12 and older \nhave used meth in the past year. By providing additional resources for \nprevention and education, I believe that we can make considerable \nheadway in fighting this terrible epidemic, and I am glad that the \nSenate has acted on this important measure.\n\n[[Page S9908]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will put on a different hat. I was \ntalking about appropriations. Now I will talk about a drama that is \nunfolding in the Senate which is the confirmation hearings on Judge \nJohn Roberts to go to the Supreme Court and to be the Chief Justice. I \nrise today to talk about this nomination because this is a decision of \nenormous consequence. One of the most significant and far-reaching \nvotes a Senator can make relates to the Supreme Court. Why? Because it \nis irrevocable. When you vote for a Supreme Court Justice, that Justice \nhas a lifetime appointment. Unless there is an impeachment, which is \nrare, it is forever.\n  The hearings are incredibly important, they provide the Senate and \nthe American public with the opportunity to know more about where the \nnominee stands on core constitutional principles. I urge Judge Roberts \nto answer the questions that the Committee asks of him.\n  But equally important is completing the picture. The Senate should \nhave access to the full record of the nominee who is going into the \nhearings. We need to know more about Judge Roberts. We have all met \nhim. We find him personable. We find him smart. We find him capable. \nBut we wonder, what is his judicial philosophy. What will he be like, \nnot only as a member of Court but now as the Chief Justice. Look back \nto the record, not only the resume but to the record.\n  This is why I am joining with a group of other Senators to urge the \nWhite House to release documents on 16 cases argued by the Solicitor \nGeneral when Judge Roberts was the Principal Deputy Solicitor General. \nYou might ask: Why do you need to know this? This is when then Mr. \nRoberts played a very important role in shaping strategy, recommending \npolicy, and it is one of the best insights we have into his judicial \nphilosophy, his views, his legal reasoning. We want to know: Where does \nhe stand on an issue such as the implicit right of privacy, on issues \nrelated to civil rights, on religious expression, on title IX, on \naffirmative action, and voting rights. And we want to know because the \nrecord before us now raises serious questions about his commitment to \nwomen's and civil rights. Prior to any vote, the American people need \nto know where he stands on these issues. We, the Senators, need to \nknow, too, so we can make an informed, rational decision.\n  The administration has refused to release these documents, even \nthough they did so before. They did it when Mr. Bork was nominated, and \nthey did it when William Rehnquist was nominated. This is particularly \ncompelling since now the Roberts nomination has gone from a replacement \nof Justice Sandra Day O'Connor to replacing the Chief Justice. These \ndocuments matter because they represent the views from later in his \ncareer when he held his highest political appointment and was \nresponsible for making policy recommendations. These documents will \nilluminate his beliefs and his approach to the law, and they will help \nthis Senator and others to know where he stands on the important \nissues.\n  It is the constitutional duty of the Senate to conduct a thorough \nexamination of the nominee, and we can only do it if we hear from the \nnominee himself through the confirmation processes, and have a complete \nrecord before us. We have his resume, he has received his rating from \nthe American Bar Association, but we now need the documents on these 16 \ncases in order for us to do our homework and to do our due diligence. \nThis is probably one of the most important votes I will ever take, \nalong with my 99 colleagues. We need to know:\n  What type of Justice will John Roberts be?\n  Before the Senate left for its August break, I joined with six of my \nDemocratic women colleagues to launch a website allowing Americans to \nhave a voice in the confirmation process. The American people have a \nright to be part of the process and let the Senate know what they want \nJudge Roberts to answer. And we want them at the table. We want them to \nfeel included and have the chance to participate. The Democratic women \nlaunched a Web site to allow them that opportunity. We remember how we \nwere shut out during the judicial proceedings on Clarence Thomas. There \nwere no women on the Judiciary Committee. Now there are. But we know \nwhat it is like not to have a seat at the table. We know what it is \nlike not to be able to raise our questions. So we established this Web \nsite so the public could ask about issues that impact them every day.\n\n  Guess what. Over the past month alone, 25,000 Americans responded to \nthis Web site--with over 40,000 questions. They wanted to know where \nJudge Roberts stands on Roe v. Wade, privacy rights in light of \nnational security challenges, the right to privacy, such as under the \nPATRIOT Act, what about so-called religious expression in schools, \nprotecting our environment, protecting our civil rights, protecting our \nvoting rights. And I am standing with them, because the record before \nus shows that Judge Roberts has argued against established \nconstitutional protections against sex discrimination. He has argued \nthat disparate treatment of men and women is reasonable when you don't \nhave the resources to provide for both. He supported a very narrow \ninterpretation of title IX. All arguments which the Supreme Court has \nsquarely rejected.\n  Clearly, there are reasons people are troubled. Questions that \nAmericans sent us were on the deepest and most heartfelt concerns of \ntheir families. A woman in Ohio wanted to ask Judge Roberts where he \nstands on women's equality. She said not just on choice and \nreproductive rights, but on wage equality, childcare options, glass \nceilings. Where is he in the enforcement of equal opportunity and \nnondiscrimination.\n  A man from my home State of Maryland wanted to know did Judge Roberts \nsupport title IX. His niece played sports in high school and wanted to \nbe sure that college sports teams would have resources and access to \nscholarships, as the guy teams do. A mother from Indiana wrote us. A \nsingle mom. In the 1950s, she was earning 60 cents for every dollar a \nman earned. She wanted to know where the judge stands on pay equity. \nThese were the kinds of things they wanted to know. Quite frankly, I \nwould like to know too. How Judge Roberts chooses to respond is his \nbusiness. But whether we support the nominee based on those responses \nis our business and how the administration responds to our requests for \ndocuments is also our business.\n  That is why the White House must release those documents to the \nSenate. We want to have access to the documents relating to those 16 \nvery important cases that were argued by the Solicitor General before \nthe Supreme Court. These documents will help us evaluate the nominee \nand will enable us to make the kind of decision the American people \nwant us to make.\n  As Judge Roberts begins his testimony and is asked about his past \ndecisions, judicial philosophy and legal background, Americans will be \nwatching. I urge the nominee to be forthcoming. He should not conceal \nhis views on issues that the majority of Americans care about like \nreproductive choice, civil rights, congressional power, the environment \nand separation of church and state.\n  I also urge the White House to be forthcoming. They should not \nconceal documents that may illuminate those views. Judge Roberts' past \ncareer causes concern about his commitment to core constitutional \nprinciples and we need to have, and the American people deserve, a \ncomplete picture.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask if the Senator would allow me to propound a \nunanimous consent request so that I might speak at the conclusion of \nthe speakers she has on her side.\n\n[[Page S9909]]\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First, in terms of senatorial courtesy, I have no \nreason to object. But as I understand it, the order of the day is that \nat 5:30, we must go into consideration of the mercury rule for 1 hour. \nI ask the Presiding Officer, what is the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order is that at 5:30, the Senate will be \nin morning business for 1 hour with the time controlled by Senator \nInhofe of Oklahoma or his designee, and the Senator from Nevada, Mr. \nReid, or his designee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. May I ask the Presiding Officer, at 5:30 the Senate \nwill go into morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Who controls that morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided and controlled by \nSenator Inhofe of Oklahoma or his designee and the Senator from Nevada, \nMr. Reid, or his designee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I misunderstood. I thought there was a mandate at 5:30 \nto go to the mercury rule. I have no objection to the Senator's \nrequest.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed at 5:30 to \nproceed for 10 minutes in morning business and that I be recognized at \nthat time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. GREGG. Assuming the speakers on the other side have completed \ntheir statements.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have absolutely no problem with this. I know Senator \nClinton is trying to make it from an airplane to get to the floor. So \nas I understand it, Senator Mikulski has the time until 5:30; is that \ncorrect?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Hopefully, she will make it. If I could cover us and say \n5:35, and then it would go to Senator Gregg, would that be OK?\n  Mr. GREGG. I amend my request so that I be recognized at 5:35 for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have now concluded my remarks and \nyield to the Senator from California, Senator Boxer, such time as she \nmay consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nleadership in reaching out to the people of this country, asking them \nto send in their questions for Judge Roberts. As she noted, 25,000 \nindividuals wrote in questions and we received a total of 40,000 \nquestions. It shows the American people have a lot at stake. This is a \nserious time for our country, and a very important nomination. We \ncertainly know that.\n  Most Americans understand that the Court plays a huge role in \ndefending our rights and freedoms, and now Judge Roberts has been \nnominated to be the Chief Justice of the United States. Although some \nwill say it makes no difference, it makes a big difference. The Chief \nJustice runs the Court, sets its tone, assigns responsibility for \nwriting its decisions, has a certain amount of cachet to speak for the \nCourt, and so on.\n  The Judiciary Committee began its hearings today on Judge Roberts. \nThis is a vital part of the advice and consent role of the Senate. \nBefore we vote, it is every Senator's duty to find out if Judge Roberts \nwill uphold or undermine our fundamental freedoms, the freedoms that \nessentially define us as Americans. It is our duty to find out if Judge \nRoberts will fulfill the promise etched above the Court itself: Equal \njustice under the law--not justice only for the powerful, but equal \njustice for all. And when I say we have a duty, I am talking about our \nresponsibility as Senators to act on behalf of we the American people.\n  That is why the Democratic women, under Senator Mikulski's \nleadership, created the AskRoberts Web site. Americans submitted 40,000 \nquestions about a broad range of issues, including privacy, \nreproductive health, civil rights, women's rights, and the environment. \nOne individual posed this question to Judge Roberts: In your opinion, \nwhy would the White House refuse to turn over public records from your \ntime as Deputy Solicitor General? What is there to hide?\n  What is there to hide? It is a very important question. Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle should be asking that question. Before we \nconfirm Judge Roberts to a lifetime appointment as Chief Justice, we \nneed to know everything possible about his views and philosophy. This \nisn't because it is interesting, because I am sure it would be \ninteresting. Judge Roberts is a very bright and interesting man. But it \nis because every American's rights and freedoms hang in the balance. \nJudge Roberts has a very thin record on the bench. Therefore, his \nwritings and statements, when he worked for the Reagan administration \nand the first Bush administration, become very important.\n  We know that in his position working for Kenneth Starr, Mr. Roberts \nplayed a very important role. He was a top decisionmaker in the \nSolicitor General's Office. He appeared before the Supreme Court and, \nby his own admission, made the final determination of which cases to \nappeal in hundreds of circumstances. It is not as if we haven't gotten \ninformation like this before. We did so during the confirmation \nhearings for Judge Bork and Justice Rehnquist.\n  That is why Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, under the \nleadership of Senator Leahy, and the Democratic leadership, under the \nleadership of Senator Reid, and the Democratic women, under the \nleadership of Senator Mikulski, and the entire Democratic caucus have \nwritten letter after letter to Attorney General Gonzales demanding \nthese documents be released.\n  We are talking about a very narrow request--only 16 cases--not a \nbroad request for all records. What are these cases we are asking \nabout? They include three about reproductive health, five about \ndiscrimination and civil rights, and three about the environment. These \nare the very issues Americans told us they wanted Roberts to answer \nquestions about when they wrote to our Web site.\n  In poll after poll, the American people are saying that Judge Roberts \nhas to tell us what he believes, and we deserve to have this \ninformation. Everyone agrees that Judge Roberts is extremely qualified \nand very personable. But we need to know about his views and philosophy \nbecause, if confirmed, the cases he would decide will impact the daily \nlives of all Americans.\n  I believe the American people want transparency and openness in this \nprocess. This should not be some hide-and-seek, catch-me-if-you-can \ndeal. This is about someone who could sit on the Court for 30 years, or \nmore. This is someone who is going to influence the lives of our \ngrandchildren and perhaps even our great grandchildren.\n  In addition to getting the information on these cases, Judge Roberts \nalso must answer questions, and I hope he is going to do that. I know a \ncouple of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle today seemed to \nbe counseling him not to answer questions. One of them cited Judge \nGinsburg, and said she drew the line by refusing to answer questions.\n  Let me tell you what Judge Ginsburg said at her hearing when she was \nasked about Roe v. Wade and a woman's reproduction freedom. She said:\n\n       It's a decision she must make for herself.\n\n  And when Government controls that decision for her, she is being \ntreated as less than a fully adult human.\n  That is a quote from Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And it is certainly at odds \nwith all that Senator Hatch and others are saying about how Ruth Bader \nGinsburg didn't answer questions about key legal issues. No. 1, her \nwritings on this and other topics were extensive. Then at the hearing, \nshe said clearly that when the Government takes control--I am going to \nread it again:\n\n       When Government controls that decision, a woman is being \n     treated as less than a fully adult human.\n\n  I want to know whether Judge Roberts agrees with that. He will have a \nchance to express that view and also his view about the role of \nCongress in protecting our families and communities. Take, for example, \nthe violence against women. Part of that act, written by Joe Biden and \nOrrin Hatch--and I worked with Senator Biden for years on that--part of \nthat law was thrown out. We want to know how Judge Roberts feels about \nwhether we in the Senate can protect the women of our country, can \nprotect the families of our country, can protect those who perhaps \ncannot speak for themselves.\n\n[[Page S9910]]\n\n  We need to know if Judge Roberts thinks the right to privacy is a \nfundamental right. We know he wrote about it as the so-called right of \nprivacy.\n  If I referred to your spouse as your ``so-called spouse,'' that would \nbe an insult, wouldn't it? If I referred to your right to vote as your \n``so-called right to vote,'' my constituency would be very upset with \nme because the right to vote is not a so-called right. So when you say \nsomething is a so-called right, it raises a lot of questions about how \nyou feel about it.\n  We also need to know why Judge Roberts argued before the Supreme \nCourt and on national TV that our Federal courts and marshals had no \nrole in stopping clinic violence when women were being threatened and \nintimidated at family planning clinics all over the country.\n  It is time for Judge Roberts to say what he really thinks--on \nprivacy, on gender discrimination, on civil rights, on the environment. \nOn the appellate court, he wrote an opinion that raises questions about \nwhether he would find the endangered species act constitutional. Does \nhe think it is our right in the Congress to pass environmental laws \nthat protect all Americans?\n  As Senator Mikulski said, the role of the women Senators is very \nimportant. Women across America are counting on us to stand up, to ask \nthe questions, and to get the answers. When we vote on this nomination, \nit must be an informed vote either yes because we believe he will \nprotect our rights and freedoms or no because we have not been \nconvinced.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my time to Senator Mikulski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the senior Senator \nfrom the State of Washington, Mrs. Murray, for such time as she may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for \norganizing the AskRoberts.com in which we are all participating to \nallow people across this country to be a part of this very important \nprocess that is occurring in the Senate today.\n  Today, our country faces many challenges. We look at the suffering \nalong the gulf coast, we face ongoing military operations in Iraq and \nin Afghanistan, and we face the solemn and significant task of not only \nfilling two Court vacancies but confirming a new Chief Justice. While \nthe confirmation of a new Justice may not be the topic of dinner table \nconversations across the country tonight, the actions of the next \nSupreme Court Justice will impact the lives of every American family \nfor generations to come.\n  Last week, this Chamber mourned the passing of Chief Justice \nRehnquist who served on our Nation's highest Court for over three \ndecades. The great range of issues on which the Supreme Court ruled \nduring Justice Rehnquist's tenure--from Roe v. Wade to capital \npunishment to Miranda rights to the conclusion of a Presidential \nelection--shows the American public just how closely the Court touches \neach of our daily lives. My home State of Washington is 3,000 miles \naway from the Nation's Capital, but the issues the Supreme Court takes \nup, whether it be title IX or eminent domain or a woman's right to \nchoose, hits home for them as well.\n  Back in 1991, when I was a State Senator and a former school board \nmember and a mother, I watched the Clarence Thomas confirmation \nhearings that came before the Senate Judiciary Committee. For days and \ndays, I sat in frustration at home. I simply could not believe that \nthis nominee was not asked about the issues about which I cared. I did \nnot believe the Senators in that room were representing me or asking \nthe questions I wanted answered. So I did something about it: I ran for \nthe U.S. Senate. Now, thankfully, I am here and I can get my questions \nanswered. But I remain very concerned for the women and the men in my \nState and around the country. Certainly they have issues that are \nimportant to them that will come before the Supreme Court. Certainly \nthey have questions they want answered. Not everyone is going to be \nable to run for the Senate, but everyone should be able to have their \nvoice heard.\n  This is a process in which the American public deserves to be \ninvolved. Judge Roberts is being considered for a lifetime appointment, \nand the American people deserve to know where he stands on a number of \nissues that affect our Nation's future. That desire to give Americans \naround the country a voice in this process is what inspired me and my \ncolleagues from California and Maryland to set up a Web site: \nAskRoberts.com. Through our Web site, we have collected tens of \nthousands of questions over the past several months that have now been \ndelivered to the Senate Judiciary Committee in hopes that they will be \nasked of Judge Roberts during his confirmation hearing.\n  This is not an inside-the-beltway debate. Judge Roberts has been \nnominated to a lifetime appointment on the highest Court in the land, \nand he will influence our path on issues ranging across the spectrum.\n  Many Americans must be wondering what this all means to them, how it \nwill affect them. Let me make it clear: This debate we are now having \nis about whether we want to protect essential rights and liberties, \nincluding the right to privacy about which the Senator from California \ntalked. This debate is about whether we want free and open government. \nThis debate is about whether we want a clean, healthy environment and \nthe ability to enforce laws to protect it fairly. And this debate is \nabout preserving equal protection under the law.\n  Judge Roberts has an obligation--not to the Senate but to the \nAmerican people--to make his views known on these basic values. Only \nthen can we make a reasoned judgment on his nomination. That is why I \nhave joined with a number of my colleagues in calling on the Attorney \nGeneral to fulfill the request that was made by our colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee for documents related to 16 key cases on which \nJudge Roberts played a leadership role during his service as Solicitor \nGeneral. Not only is there precedent for the disclosure of those \ndocuments--similar information was provided to the Senate when it \nconsidered the nomination of Justice Rehnquist--but there is also clear \nimperative. If we are going to fulfill our constitutional duty to \nprovide meaningful advice and consent on this nomination, that consent \nmust be informed and this process must be opened, not only to the \nMembers of this body but to the American people.\n  With the questions and concerns of Americans from coast to coast in \nmind, I will work with my colleagues to ensure that the President's \nnominee to fill this position will be fair and impartial, evenhanded in \nadministering justice, and will protect the rights and liberties of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my remaining time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have 5 minutes \nbefore Senator Gregg has the floor; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray because she has a \nway of putting things quite succinctly and clearly and I appreciate her \ncoming to the floor.\n  There is a very interesting editorial today in USA Today, and I want \nto quote from it. The first part says there is no question that the \nPresident has chosen someone with similar views to Judge Rehnquist. \nThis is what they say:\n\n       But, if the men are similar, the nation is different now \n     from what it was when Rehnquist joined the Court 33 years \n     ago, and that difference raises provocative questions for \n     Roberts as Senate confirmation hearings begin today.\n\n  This is how they say it has changed since Judge Rehnquist's hearings:\n\n       In particular, the United States has become a far more \n     tolerant society. In 1972, racial segregation was still being \n     dismantled. Women, like African-Americans, were routinely \n     deprived of equal opportunity. The notion that Americans \n     possess a right to privacy, established by the landmark 1965 \n     Supreme Court case that overturned state laws against birth \n     control, was still taking root.\n\n  This editorial goes on to ask if Roberts would make it difficult for \nCongress to extend those gains or even turn back the clock, concluding:\n\n       His record leaves plenty of room for doubt.\n\n  Now, this is USA Today. It is not considered a liberal newspaper. It \nis a pretty mainstream paper and it raises the issue of privacy, \nwriting:\n\n\n[[Page S9911]]\n\n\n       In memos written when he was in the Reagan administration, \n     Roberts disparaged the notion that there is a constitutional \n     right to privacy that prevents the government from \n     criminalizing contraception, abortion and gay sex.\n\n  And then it talks about race:\n\n       Roberts has belittled affirmative action as ``recruiting of \n     inadequately prepared candidates'' and has argued for \n     standards that would make it easier for school districts to \n     evade desegregation orders.\n\n  On women's rights, it is also troubling:\n\n       Roberts ridiculed the concept that women are subject to \n     workplace discrimination, and he argued for narrowing the \n     government's ability to enforce the ban on gender \n     discrimination in education.\n\n  They close by saying:\n\n       His record bears close scrutiny and his answers should go a \n     long way toward determining whether he should be confirmed \n     for a lifetime appointment as the Nation's most powerful \n     jurist, deciding issues barely imaginable today and \n     influencing the lives of generations to come.\n\n  As I say, this editorial is quite mainstream. It raises legitimate \nconcerns about Judge Roberts. It basically says to the Senate, it is \nyour job to find out how he is going to rule on cases we cannot even \nenvision at this time.\n  I think that the committee is off to a good start. I received a \nbriefing while I was on a plane today about the Senators' comments on \nboth sides of the aisle. It clearly seems to be a confirmation that \nboth sides are taking extremely seriously.\n  I say to those friends and colleagues on the other side who are \ncounseling Judge Roberts that he does not have to answer questions, \nthat would be a big mistake. The American people in poll after poll are \nsaying to us, we have a right to know. We want to have answers to very \nimportant questions that will shed light on if Judge Roberts is going \nto make sure this Congress and this Federal Government can protect \nthem; that we can protect the environment; equal rights for women and \nfor minorities; that we have the ability to make life better for the \nAmerican people; and that we, in fact, will be able to respect the \ndignity of our people by making sure there is not a ``so-called'' right \nto privacy but a fundamental right to privacy that has been articulated \nby the Court and that we hope Judge Roberts will uphold.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9911-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9911-S9912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BUDGET RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak a little bit about the \nschedule of the reconciliation bill which this Congress was supposed to \nactually take up this week. As we all know, reconciliation is one of \nthe key procedures by which the Congress addresses spending, \nspecifically spending in mandatory programs and tax policy. In the \nbudget which we passed about 5 months ago, we included reconciliation \ninstructions which essentially say to committees within the Senate and \nwithin the House that they are to change the entitlement programs they \nhave jurisdiction over in order to slow the rate of growth of a number \nof those programs or in order to generate revenues from those programs \nwhich might not otherwise be coming in in order to reduce the size of \nthe deficit and in order to make the Government more affordable.\n  This reconciliation proposal which came forward requested \napproximately $34 billion in savings on the entitlement side, $70 \nbillion in tax policy changes. It was to be executed on or preceded \nwith this week with a reconciliation bill on the spending side of the \nledger. In consultation with the leadership, who obviously makes the \nfinal decisions, and with the House, we have decided to move the date \nof reconciliation so the Budget Committee will report a reconciliation \nbill on October 26. This will essentially allow committees, especially \nthe authorizing committees, which are now heavily engaged in the issue \nof trying to address the catastrophe brought on by Katrina, the \nopportunity to have time to order their reconciliation changes so they \ncan bring forward effective bills which will accomplish the \ninstructions as proposed.\n\n  Some have asked, why go forward with reconciliation at all in light \nof the Katrina situation? I think it is important to recognize what \nreconciliation is in relationship to a disaster, a catastrophe of the \nsize of Katrina. Obviously, the impact on the Gulf States has been \nenormous and we have to do whatever we can to help the people of the \nGulf States rebuild and reestablish their lives in some semblance of \norder and give them some opportunity for hope. And we are doing that as \na Congress. The administration is trying to do that and obviously the \nStates and local governments are trying to pursue that activity.\n  We will get past the Katrina problem. The people of the Gulf States \nare energetic, enthusiastic, and productive people, as are all \nAmericans, and America has come to their aid as a nation, which we \nshould. Obviously it is going to take time, but this is a one-time \nevent--hopefully never will happen again, and has never happened \nbefore--of this magnitude, and we should be able as a nation to manage \nand correct the situation and give relief to the people of that region \nand do the reconstruction that is necessary. That is a one-time \nspending event.\n  What the reconciliation instructions address are the long-term \nimplications especially of entitlement spending. We know that over the \nnext 10, 20, 30, 40 years we are looking at massive increases in \nspending on mandatory programs, especially the health programs of the \nFederal Government, primarily because of the aging of the baby boom \ngeneration. As a nation, we need to set policies in place today which \nwill allow us to be able to afford the costs which this huge generation \nis going to incur in order to maintain its health and also its \nretirement.\n  Reconciliation is a very small step down that road of trying to \nimprove the policy so we can better deliver services to seniors who get \nMedicaid and other people who get Medicaid--obviously children--and at \nthe same time make it affordable. The reconciliation instructions cover \n5 years. In fact, the Medicaid instruction, which has been the most \ncontentious, anticipates no savings in the next year. So clearly it has \nno impact on the Katrina event, most of which money for that \nrestoration will occur within the next year.\n  Over the next 5 years, what we proposed is slowing the rate of growth \nof Medicaid under the reconciliation instructions from 41 percent back \nto 40 percent. I had hoped we would go from 41 percent to 39 percent. I \nthought 39 percent was a pretty good rate of growth, but that was not \nacceptable so we are going to a 40-percent rate of growth over the next \n5 years, on a $1.1 trillion spending program. That is what Medicaid \nwill be over the next 5 years. We are suggesting that we will save $10 \nbillion--$34 billion over the whole reconciliation instruction--on a \n$1.1 trillion spending program over 5 years, with none of it occurring \nnext year.\n  How can we do that? We can actually do it by delivering more services \nto more people. If we give Governors greater flexibility with their \nMedicaid funds, Governors have told us with more flexibility they can \ncover more people and do it at lower cost. That is called good \nmanagement. It does not take a lot of good management to shave 1 \npercent off the rate of growth, which will be around 40 percent. So it \nis a very doable event, and we need to proceed with it.\n  There are other committees that have received reconciliation \ninstructions that actually want those instructions, that want to be \nable to proceed forward because they see opportunities to improve \nGovernment and to generate a better return for taxpayers. One, of \ncourse, is the Commerce Committee. Another is the HELP Committee which \nhas reported out an incredibly strong higher education bill where they \nare basically going to expand rather significantly the dollars \navailable to people who go to college through Pell programs and other \nprograms, under the leadership of Chairman Enzi. That bill has been \nreported out, has saved about $7 billion, but has also generated about \n$6.5 billion which will go back into student loans. It has done it \nwithout impacting student loans but actually expanded student loans by \ntaking action in the area of lenders accounts. Chairman Enzi deserves \nlot of credit for it and we should proceed with that.\n  Chairman Enzi also reported out a bill, along with the Finance \nCommittee, to address the pension reform issue. We need to address \npension reform. We are not going to be able to do\n\n[[Page S9912]]\n\nit unless we do it in reconciliation. We know we have major \nbankruptcies coming at us. Regrettably some of them are in the airline \nindustry, maybe even this week. There are rumors about that. We know \nwhen people go into bankruptcy, their pension funds go into the PBGC. \nWe know the PBGC has somewhere between a $30 billion and $50 billion \nprojected unfunded liability or deficit. If we are going to be able to \nmaintain those accounts so that people who have been planning all their \nlife to receive pensions, if they are in a company that goes bankrupt, \nstill receive some percentage of their pensions rather than get \ncompletely wiped out, we have to have a solvent PBGC. So Chairman Enzi \nand Chairman Grassley have both reported out bills to try to accomplish \nthat and they are using reconciliation to proceed in that direction, \nand that is very possible. So we need the reconciliation bill to put in \nplace policies which do not address the immediate problem of today, \nwhich is obviously the Katrina issue, or the problem even of next year \nor the year after.\n  These policies under reconciliation will address 5 years, 10 years, \n15 years down the road and address them in a positive way. They are \nsmall steps, but they are important steps, and that is why we need to \ngo forward with reconciliation. That is why we have set this date and \nmoved it a month but only a month.\n\n\n                         Katrina Relief Effort\n\n  On another issue, and that is the issue of Katrina and how we are \nfunding Katrina and the relief effort, we have now passed two \nsupplementals totaling about $61 billion. We know we are going to get \nanother supplemental probably within 3 or 4 weeks for another $50 \nbillion. We also know that moving through the Congress is a whole \nseries of initiatives relative to trying to give relief to the people \nin the Gulf States, which is the goal of all of us. We recognize that \nthings such as tax packages, such as WERDA, such as the COPS program, \nwe have on this bill--in fact, I think there is an amendment for the \nCOPS program of $1 billion. There is an amendment dealing with Medicaid \nwhich will cost $4 billion to $6 billion. There are flood insurance \nissues. The simple fact is that the cost of this disaster, catastrophe, \nis going to be huge. The problem we have, as I see it right now--and we \nare willing to pay that price, by the way. I am perfectly willing to \npay whatever is the appropriate price to make sure we give these people \nan opportunity to rebuild and restore their region in a logical manner. \nI have suggested that we set up a commission with a single leader along \nthe lines of the Hoover activities in the post-1927 flood where there \nwould be a focal point where all the Federal programs would come \ntogether and the money would be distributed in an orderly and planned \nmanner working with the States and the local region. Then we can set up \nsuch an authority and put a person on the ground who has a national \nreputation and knows what he or she is doing and can manage this in a \nway that is orderly and has a reasonable audit function and reasonable \nmanagement function so we make sure we get value for the dollars so \nthey are not wasted. We have seen some proposals that would not work \nand would have wasted money already.\n\n  What we are not seeing is that sort of cooperation in the Senate or \nCongress. We have ideas come from all different sides. We have ideas \ncoming from every committee--we have creative people on every \ncommittee--and we have ideas coming from the administration, but there \ndoes not appear to be any focal point for management of these ideas so \nwe are prioritizing what we need, how we need it, and where it should \ncome from and where it should go.\n  We have ideas coming out of one committee that are for flood \ninsurance, or amendments on the floor that already represent $4 billion \nto $10 billion of new spending, or we have ideas coming out of the tax \ncommittees or ideas coming out of the appropriating committees. Since \neverybody wants to respond and respond effectively, there ought to be a \nmanagement process in the Congress--and in the White House, by the \nway--that says this is what we prioritize as needed. This is what we \nwant the Congress to move on quickly. Let's take a hard look at what \nwill work and what will not work.\n  I am sorry we have not seen that yet. As chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, I have been extremely concerned about this because I think \nwe are going to wake up 6 months from now or 3 months from now and \nrealize that a haphazard approach has not been effective either in \nresolving the problems in the gulf coast or in managing the taxpayers' \nmoney effectively.\n  I am hopeful we will see a little more order in this process. I \nimplore our leadership to give us such order.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9912-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Vermont, the Senators from Maine, and many other Senators in a \nbipartisan effort to oppose the administration's mishandling of the \nClean Air Act. That is what our resolution of disapproval is about.\n  We are here because the Bush administration's mercury rule violates \nthe Clean Air Act. This rule is plainly illegal, it is unwise, and it \nis definitely unhealthy for Americans living downwind of coal-fired \npowerplants, especially mothers and their soon-to-be-born children.\n  The administration, with a simple wave of its hands, has used the \nrules to delay compliance with the mercury control requirements for a \ndecade or longer than the law allows. Our resolution of disapproval is \nsimple enough for even the biggest energy company, and the \nadministration even, to understand. We reject this abuse of the Clean \nAir Act, and we demand they follow the rules of the land.\n  The law says: Each and every powerplant unit that emits mercury and \nother toxic air pollutants must take action to reduce these emissions \nby using maximum available control technology, or MACT.\n  The administration could have gone through the appropriate statutory \nprocess to delist and exempt their powerplants from regulation, but \nthat is not what they did. Instead, they made up a whole new \nderegulatory scheme to help out the big energy companies. But the act \ndoes not provide them with that authority. They do not have the luxury \nof ignoring the laws that regular Americans must follow and that \nCongress wrote to protect the public's health and the environment. This \nadministration is not above the law.\n  The EPA is allowed to set the MACT standard after considering costs \nand any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy \nrequirements. That they could have done. But, instead, the \nadministration chose to violate a settlement agreement. They shut down \nan advisory commission because they did not like getting scientifically \ncredible answers on mercury controls and costs. The process used to \ncreate this rule was flawed and was intended to delay and obstruct any \nmercury control requirements whatsoever.\n\n[[Page S9913]]\n\n  In the end, the administration almost wholly adopted the utility \nindustry's proposal on how to regulate mercury emissions. If this is \nnot the proverbial ``fox watching the chicken coop,'' what is? This is \nnot the way the law is supposed to work in America, nor does work in \nAmerica.\n  I urge my colleagues, and everyone listening, to support our \nresolution of disapproval and to support this motion to proceed. We \ndeserve a fair up-or-down vote on the administration's rule that \nillegally exempts big energy companies from having to reduce toxic air \npollution wherever it is emitted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask that we yield 3 minutes to Senator Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think we deal today with a very \ninteresting and important issue, as a matter of fact. All of us want to \ndo something about mercury and the emissions of mercury. We also want \nto have electricity, and we want to have it at a reasonable cost. Of \ncourse, our efforts now, in terms of energy, are to try to move toward \nusing more and more coal for production because that is the biggest \nfossil fuel resource we have.\n  What we have, of course, is a proposal by the administration over a \nperiod of time to reduce mercury from this kind of production by as \nmuch as 71 percent in the country and to be able to do that in a way \nwhich will allow us to continue to use coal and to allow us to continue \nto do it at the reasonable price that we now have.\n  What we have done is developed a program to accomplish those \nimportant things. We have a regulation, 15 years in the making, which \nhas been designed to allow for the continuation of production, to allow \nfor the reduction over 70 percent in a period of 9 years, and to allow \nthose who have trouble to have some offset sales so the result is a \nreduction in mercury, which we all want to do, while we continue to \nproduce, which we all want to do.\n  I think it is a big mistake, after all these efforts that have been \nmade to accomplish all the things we want to accomplish, to say we want \nto reject that and establish something that is likely to be unworkable \nover a period of time, plus extremely expensive.\n  I urge we do not repeal this effort. The opportunity has been there \nfor Congress to work on it. We certainly will. There will be an \nopportunity to vote on it, if we proceed here as we should, and to be \nable to say, yes, we want to reduce mercury; yes, we want to continue \nthe production of electricity produced by coal, and we want to be able \nto do that over a period of time with a reasonable program. That is \nwhat we have.\n  EPA estimates the cost of this at about $2 billion over this period \nof time, when what is being proposed is to do a very different thing \nthat costs about $300 billion.\n  At any rate, I certainly urge we do not approve this idea of removing \nthis regulation, this program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield the Senator from Maine 8 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution \nthat would disapprove of the EPA's improperly crafted rule on mercury \nemissions, a rule that both the Agency's own inspector general, as well \nas the Government Accountability Office, have criticized.\n  In the wrong form, mercury is an acutely dangerous toxin that can \ncause serious neurodevelopmental harm, especially to children and \npregnant women. Recent studies indicate that at least one in six women \nof childbearing age is carrying enough accumulated mercury in her body \nto pose risk of adverse health effects to her children, should she \nbecome pregnant.\n  Tragically, EPA's own scientists found that some 630,000 infants were \nborn in the United States in the 12-month period from 1999 to 2000 with \nblood mercury levels higher than what are considered safe. In addition, \na new study released last week by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine \nfound that more than 1,500 children are born in the United States every \nyear with mental retardation as a result of mercury exposure.\n  To see just how toxic mercury is, one does not have to look any \nfarther than my home State of Maine. Every freshwater river, lake, and \nstream in my State is subject to a mercury advisory warning pregnant \nwomen and young children to limit consumption of fish caught in these \nwaters. While this advisory is bad enough for the many anglers who love \nto fish in Maine's beautiful waters, it is especially difficult for \nindigenous people, like those of the Penobscot Nation, for whom \nsubsistence fishing is an important part of their culture.\n  Mercury is dangerous not only to people--and particularly children--\nbut also to wildlife. Let me cite one study conducted by researchers in \nmy own State. The Biodiversity Research Institute in Falmouth, ME, \nfound that mercury concentration in loon eggs increased from Western to \nEastern United States. They found that mercury concentration in loon \neggs in Maine was dangerously--nearly four times--higher than those \nfound in Alaska where there is not the exposure to mercury from \npowerplants that we experience in Maine due to the prevailing winds.\n  Despite the overwhelming hazards of mercury pollution and the fact \nthat coal-fired powerplants are the single largest source of mercury \nemissions in our country, the EPA inexplicably decided to remove \npowerplants from the list of mercury sources that must be regulated \nunder the strictest provisions of the Clean Air Act. Instead, the EPA \nrule would regulate mercury emissions under a much weaker cap-and-trade \nprogram and would give the industry an extra decade to meet even this \nweaker emissions level. If this rule is allowed to go into effect, \npowerplants will be free to continue spewing unlimited amounts of toxic \nmercury into our air until the year 2018.\n  Both the EPA inspector general and the GAO have severely criticized \nthe EPA rule. The IG found that the EPA conducted analyses in order to \njustify a predetermined conclusion, did not adequately analyze the \nimpact of this rule on the health of our children, and the EPA was \nfound by the inspector general not to have conducted the appropriate \ncost-benefit analysis of regulatory alternatives. The GAO found that \ntheir cost-effective mercury controls would make it possible to achieve \nfar greater mercury emissions reductions than the EPA rule calls for.\n  I call on our colleagues to join me--Senator Leahy, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Snowe, and many others--in sending this flawed rule back to the \ndrawing board. EPA's mercury rule is not based on sound science. It \ndoes not employ the proper cost-benefit analysis. It will harm human \nhealth and the health of our environment, and it simply should not be \nallowed to go into effect. Our resolution, the Leahy-Collins \nresolution, would give the EPA the chance to fix these flaws and come \nback with a rule that would better protect the American people and our \nNation's streams, rivers, lakes, air, and wildlife.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Isakson). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, my friend and neighbor, for her statement.\n  I see the other Senator from Maine on the floor. I believe she sought \n4 minutes. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Leahy for his leadership, \nas well as Senator Collins and Senator Jeffords and so many others in \nbringing forward this resolution of disapproval.\n  I am here because I happen to believe that the air in Maine, or any \npart of this country, should not be for sale to the lowest bidder when \nit comes to our air. Given that the EPA spent over a decade developing \nthe scientific and technological basis for regulating major sources of \nmercury--dangerous mercury--I am confounded by the failure of its rule \nto meet either the letter or the intent of the law.\n  The proposed EPA rule represents a missed opportunity to incorporate \nthe recent research into the health effects of mercury or the recent \ntechnological innovations that significantly reduce the levels of \nmercury emissions. If enacted, the resolution will suspend the first \nEPA rule that overturns its own\n\n[[Page S9914]]\n\n2000 decision and allows powerplants to be delisted as a source of \nmercury pollution.\n  Since 2000, research has determined that mercury pollution is more \nwidespread, its effect more pronounced, and methods to reduce it \nimproved. However, the EPA proposal fails to reflect the severity of \nthe situation and allows a weak cap-and-trade system. Under this cap-\nand-trade rule, many plants will never have to install controls if they \nchoose to simply buy their way out by purchasing allowances from other \nplants.\n\n  The issue of mercury toxins is beyond dollars and cents. Mercury, \ncontained in coal emitted through smokestacks into the atmosphere as \nthe coal is burned, is transported to the air and carried downward for \nhundreds and hundreds of miles. It is carried by snow and rain back \ndown to Earth into our communities, onto our streets, and around our \nschools. Inevitably, these toxins pollute our lakes, rivers, and \nstreams. The mercury is then ingested by the fish and, in turn, \nconsumers who eat fish harvested from these freshwater sources. The \ngrowing concentration of the amount of mercury has caused a significant \nproblem, not only for Maine's seafood industry but our Nation's.\n  The EPA issued an advisory about mercury and seafood sales in our \ncountry, and since March 2004 sales of tuna, for example, in America \nhave declined by 10 percent. This has resulted in the revenue loss of \nmore than $150 million to the industry. However, we cannot fault the \nconsumers but, rather, our own failed Government policy.\n  If EPA had followed the Clean Air Act and retained its 2000 decision, \neach utility unit would have been required to reduce mercury pollutants \nby 70 to 90 percent in 2008. I should point out that powerplants are \nthe largest remaining unregulated source of mercury pollution in the \nUnited States--accounting for the 90,000 pounds of airborne mercury a \nyear.\n  EPA's own considerable research on the sources and effects of manmade \nmercury pollution confirms that mercury emissions are getting worse. To \nmy dismay, the less stringent EPA approach will inevitably fail to \nprotect either the health of our children or Maine's natural resources \nand the economies that depend on them.\n  The EPA proposal, at its fundamental level, clearly is delinquent in \nprotecting all Americans equally from the hazards of mercury pollution. \nUnder these guidelines, a powerplant can buy its way out of mercury \nrestrictions and continue to plague the surrounding population. Our \ncommitment to our communities in America should be uniform, and thus \nour restriction of this neurotoxin should be consistent.\n  We know for a fact that human ingestion of mercury causes grave \nneurological damage to young children, infants, and the unborn. \nMethylmercury is a known neurotoxin and development inhibitor in unborn \nbabies. Children and fetuses are most susceptible because mercury can \nhave a damaging effect on developing brains. Reports tell us that \nnearly 4.9 million women of childbearing age have elevated levels of \nmercury and that approximately 630,000 children born each year are at \nrisk from mercury-related learning and developmental problems. I find \nthese figures unacceptable. In fact, we all should.\n  Neurotoxins are not commodities; neurotoxins are poison. I believe \nthat these pollutants and poisons should not be traded in our society \nbut, rather, should be significantly restricted and reduced. It is our \nduty to enact such a rule.\n  I hope we will adopt the mercury resolution of disapproval.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to yield 8 minutes to \nprobably the Senator who knows more about air quality and the Clean Air \nAct than any of the rest of us, the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this \nresolution. This represents a continuing saga that started out in 2001 \nby those of us from the midwestern part of the United States of America \nwith our respected friends from the northeastern part of the United \nStates. I believe everyone should put what we are doing tonight in \ncontext; that is, to be effective, this resolution must be passed by \nthe Senate and House and signed by the President.\n  While the act provides for expedited and privileged procedures in the \nSenate, there is no such rule in the House. The House will not consider \nthis. The President announced today, if the resolution is passed, that \nhe would veto it. That is where we are.\n  On March 15, the EPA finalized the Clean Air Mercury Rule and made \nthe United States the first nation in the world to regulate mercury \nemissions from existing coal-fired powerplants--the first in the world. \nThrough two phases in a ``cap-and-trade'' program, mercury emissions \nwill be reduced by 70 percent. This is modeled after the Nation's most \nsuccessful clean air program, the Acid Rain Program. Modeling by the \nElectric Power Research Institute, an independent nonprofit research \norganization, shows that the rule will reduce mercury in every State. \nThis is quite amazing, given the nature of mercury.\n\n  It is important for my colleagues to understand that all the mercury \nthat is being deposited in the United States doesn't come from the \nUnited States. Only 1 percent of the mercury in the world comes from \nour powerplants in this country. Mercury pollution is a global issue \nbecause it travels hundreds of thousands of miles. About 5 percent of \nworldwide mercury emissions comes from natural sources, such as oceans \nand volcanoes. From 1990 to 1999, EPA estimates that U.S. emissions of \nmercury were reduced by nearly a half, which has been completely offset \nby increases in emissions from Asia.\n  The fact is that U.S. powerplants account for a small percentage of \nworldwide emissions, and most of the mercury deposited in our Nation \ncomes from outside the country and natural sources. Still, the \nadministration has decided to lead with the first-ever Federal \nregulation of powerplant mercury emissions in the world.\n  By using the Congressional Review Act, the Senator from Vermont and \nthe resolution's supporters are seeking to topple this regulation that \nhas been nearly 15 years in the making--starting in the Clinton \nadministration--and represents one of the most extensive rulemakings \never conducted for a clean air regulation.\n  The broader intent of the resolution seems to force EPA to impose a \nvery costly and potentially devastating regulation. Several of the \nsponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 20 have expressed support for \nmaximum available control technology--called a MACT standard--to reduce \nmercury emissions from every powerplant by 90 percent within 3 years. \nProponents of this approach claim that each powerplant should be able \nto reduce mercury emissions by at least 90 percent. However, this level \nof reduction is not currently achievable, and no controlled technology \nvendor can guarantee the performance of mercury removal technology at \nthis or any other specific level in the future.\n  According to the independent Energy Information Administration, a \nMACT standard would have a devastating impact on our Nation because \ncoal plants unable to attain it would be forced to fuel-switch away \nfrom coal, which is our most abundant and least costly energy source, \nto natural gas.\n  Increased reliance on natural gas for electricity generation will add \nto the already obscene increase in natural gas costs that our \nbusinesses and families are exposed to, including those people who live \nin the northeastern part of the United States. We have the highest \nnatural gas prices in the developed world, and increased costs have \ndiminished our businesses' competitive position in the global \nmarketplace. We don't live in a cocoon; we live in a global \nmarketplace. The chemical industry's eight-decade run as a major \nexporter ended in 2003 with a $19 billion trade surplus in 1997 \nbecoming a $9.6 billion deficit. These are real jobs.\n  The impact of a MACT standard has led many groups to express \nopposition to this resolution, including the American Chemistry \nCouncil, American Farm Bureau Federation, Edison Electric Institute, \nNational Mining Association, National Association of Manufacturers, and \nUnited Mine Workers of America. It just can't be justified from a cost-\nbenefit point of view.\n\n[[Page S9915]]\n\n  This is very important. While EPA estimates the cost of its cap-and-\ntrade rule at about $2 billion, EIA has projected costs as high as $358 \nbillion for a 90-percent MACT standard.\n  The public's return for such a regulation is an average increase in \nnational electricity and natural gas prices by 20 percent and \nadditional reduction in U.S. mercury disposition of 2 percent, an \nalmost immeasurable decline in people's exposure to mercury.\n  I don't understand why people in this country are so bent on doing \nthe ``perfect,'' when you have something that is good and makes sense \nfrom a cost-benefit point of view. Given the state of technology and \ncost of various proposals, the best way to reduce emissions now is by \nreducing sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxides and getting cost-benefit \nreductions. Obtaining reductions cost effectively is very important; \notherwise, companies may not be able to move forward with other \npollution benefits such as integrated gasification combined cycle.\n  We are moving ahead with the Energy bill and by reducing \nSOX and NOX we will do more to reduce mercury \nthan any other proposal out there. I hope my colleagues understand what \nwe are talking about tonight. Whatever happens tonight, it is going \nnowhere because the President has said he will veto this resolution if \nit passes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suppose there are Members who think we \nare in great shape, the air is clean, no problems whatsoever. The fact \nis, of course, we have significant mercury in the air that is created \nin the United States. It tends to occur disproportionately in one part \nof the United States, the Northeast, making the waters, fish, and air \nunsafe for children and for pregnant mothers. I will speak more on that \nas we go along. If this rule would actually help, I would be all for \nit.\n  Let's be serious. If we ever wondered what a mercury pollution rule \nwritten by the polluters would look like, now we know. This is pretty \nmuch it. Some of this rule was copied verbatim, we now find out from \nsome very brave people. It was copied verbatim from the sheets given by \nthe companies most involved in the pollution.\n  Most Americans have a great deal of trust in the Environmental \nProtection Agency since it was created during President Nixon's \nadministration. It is very sad, very appalling to see how they have \nbeen captured by special interests. It is regrettable the American \npeople and many of their representatives in Congress have been forced \nto the conclusion that mercury rules have been so mishandled and so co-\nopted by special interests that this rare effort to override is \nnecessary.\n  We have a simple choice on mercury pollution. Do we follow the \nadministration and the well-funded special interests who are creating \nmost of the mercury pollution and take several steps backward and thus \nforce the American people to wait at least another decade before \ncleaning up the toxic mercury spewing out of old powerplants across \nthis country? Do we allow this new rule to allow toxic mercury? So \neveryone understands what we are talking about, this does not just make \nthe skies darker. This is a substance so harmful that it causes birth \ndefects, IQ loss, and mental retardation. Do we continue to let it \npoison children and pregnant women, while costing taxpayers billions in \nhealth care costs?\n  Shouldn't we heed the proliferation of warnings our States and the \nFederal Government have had to give to anglers and women, to the \ngeneral public, about the consumption of fish--fish caught not from \noutside our country but in streams and lakes and rivers all across \nAmerica? Shouldn't that be enough to shame our Government into action?\n  Should we allow this rule to move forward, the Bush administration's \nown inspector general says it does not comply with EPA Executive order \nrequirements. Their own inspector general says it does not comply. The \nGovernment Accountability Office has said there are major shortcomings \nin the economic analysis. Or should we uphold the bipartisan work of \nRepublicans and Democrats alike that produced the Clean Air Act, thus \nprotecting the health of pregnant women and children?\n  The Clean Air Act requires EPA to control each powerplant emission by \n2008 at the latest. That is the law of the land. Anything less is more \npollution. Instead, the administration has turned the Clean Air Act on \nits head. And this notwithstanding the two previous administrations, \nRepublican and Democrat, that sought to enforce it.\n  Now they have revoked an earlier EPA finding that is necessary and \nappropriate to require these powerplants apply technology to reduce \nmercury emissions. By revoking the earlier EPA finding and deciding \ninstead to coddle the biggest mercury polluters, the administration is \nsaying it is no longer necessary or appropriate to adequately control \nmercury emissions. It is an audacious disregard for the health of the \nAmerican people.\n\n  Let's do the rule over. Let's get it right. Look what we have. EPA \nrules are in orange on the chart and do not meet the clean air \nrequirements. The Clean Air Act is in blue on the chart. That shows how \nbadly they miss it.\n  This rule is going to allow more mercury into our environment than \neven the current law. If we leave the current law alone, there would be \nless mercury in our environment. Instead, the rule gives more pollution \nfor longer than the Clean Air Act allows.\n  The rule is all the more shameful because of the health damage. EPA's \nown estimate of the number of newborns at risk of elevated mercury \nexposure has doubled to 630,000. They also found that one in six \npregnant women has mercury levels in her blood above the EPA-safe \nthreshold. I love to have people stand up and say we are family \nfriendly around here. Family friendly with 630,000 newborns at risk? \nOne in six pregnant women at risk, that is family friendly?\n  Also, mercury emissions contaminate 10 million acres of lakes and \n400,000 miles of streams, which triggers advisories in 45 States \nwarning America's 41 million recreational anglers the fish they catch \nmay not be safe to eat.\n  One reason the administration has such a lack of candor is the fact \nwe discovered this rule has the polluting industries' fingerprints all \nover it. Their first proposal for these rules lifted exact text \nprovided by the utility industry lobbyists. Of course, when the \nlobbyists are shut in and the public is shut out, when the scientific \nand economic analysis was manipulated and where the public's health was \nignored, we get a rule like this.\n  The Bush administration's own inspector general and the Government \nAccountability Office criticized almost every aspect of how EPA drafted \nthis rule. Their recommendations to improve it were ignored. So were \nmore than 680,000 public comments, a record for EPA. They produce a \nrule that will do nothing for at least a decade.\n  They punted, and in the meantime, the grandfathered powerplants keep \nputting mercury into our water, into our fish, putting a generation of \nwomen at risk. We tell them their health is not important. We are told \nit is not a family value to put another generation of young kids at \nrisk of learning disabilities. That is what the mercury rules do.\n  People in the United States will watch what we do in the Senate, how \nwe vote. Will we side with the American people or the big polluters?\n  The administration's mercury rule is a danger to America's women and \nchildren. It is time to do it over and do it right. Listen to the Bush \nadministration's own inspector general. Do it right. I hope we do go \nwith the motion to proceed.\n  The distinguished Senator from New Jersey is in the Senate and was \nseeking 2 minutes. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  I am sorry, I withhold.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let him go ahead.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the time is short but certainly the \nalarm is real.\n  As I look at this, I am bewildered. I have three daughters. I have \nbeen fortunate enough to have 10 grandchildren. I have one son. The \nmost precious assets I have in this world are these 10 little kids. I \ncannot believe that any Member here, in a face-to-face discussion, \nwould say, We have to protect the ability of the coal powerplant\n\n[[Page S9916]]\n\nto continue to emit more mercury into the atmosphere. I cannot believe \nanyone would take that as a fair exchange. Would you rather make sure \nour coal-fired powerplants have the right to increase the emissions of \nmercury or would you rather know that this child who may be in utero \nhas a lesser chance of being affected by the scourge of mercury?\n  Stated in a publication put out by the National Education \nAssociation, small doses of mercury can impair the brain and the \ndeveloping nervous system. Infants who appear normal during the first \nfew months of life may later display subtle effects, shorter attention \nspan, poorer motor skills, slow language development, problems with \nvisual-spatial ability such as drawing and memory. These children will \nlikely need extra help to keep up in school, possibly remedial classes \nor special education.\n  I hope all of our colleagues, who I know feel as strongly about the \nprotection of our people as I do, but for goodness sake, do not ignore \nthose protections by saying we have to make sure that the powerplants \ndo not have to do their part and reduce the emission of more mercury.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Bond.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of our committee.\n  I rise to ask my colleagues in the Senate to think about raising \nenergy costs on American families and workers when we are suffering a \nsignificant energy problem. The American people already are struggling \nwith high gasoline prices. The natural gas prices are going to go even \nhigher. Winter is approaching, with heating bills regrettably expected \nto go through the roof.\n  This, in my view, is no time to hit our families with even more \nenergy price hikes. To borrow a slogan from the other side, those are \nnot family friendly.\n  Supporters of using the Congressional Review Act to overturn EPA's \nnew mercury regulation will not mention the higher energy costs they \nwill bring. The problem is, voting for this motion requires an \nimpossible solution. The technology does not exist to accomplish what \nproponents want. They want to reduce mercury from coal emissions by 90 \npercent. The administration wants to reduce it by 70 percent. If I had \na magic wand, I would be happy to wave it and support a 90-percent \nreduction. But I don't. And the hard-working workers and vulnerable \nfamilies in Missouri and all the other States represented here would \nnot be able to take the higher costs that would come with this.\n  Sponsors claim the technology exists and is used in Europe. But they \nmight not mention the technology is used on municipal waste. The last \ntime I checked, orange peels and coffee grinds were a little different \nfrom coal. Sponsors may say the technology is starting to be pilot \ntested in the United States. What they are testing it on is Eastern \ncoal, Appalachian coal, not Western coal, which is a different chemical \nmakeup. It may still seem like coal to you and me, but it makes \nextracting tiny amounts of mercury very difficult. Western coal is used \noverwhelmingly in Missouri, and many of our Western States do not \nrespond to the same technologies pursued by the motion's sponsors.\n  Therefore, generators serving my State of Missouri and many other \nWestern coal States would be forced to shut down their coal plants and \nswitch to natural gas to make electricity.\n  Natural gas prices are three times what they were just a few years \nago. Using it to make electricity, one Nobel laureate scientist said, \nis like burning your antique furniture in your fireplace to heat your \nhome.\n  Manufacturers and employers who depend upon natural gas for a raw \nmaterial are outsourcing their operations to China and other low-cost \nnatural gas areas. That means Missouri workers and workers in States of \nmy colleagues who make plastics, automobiles, chemicals, and metals \nwill be losing jobs. Do we want to see even more workers hurt?\n  Farmers everywhere are already facing high prices for natural-gas-\ndependent fertilizer. Terrible drought has struck the Midwest's corn \nand soybean crops. On top of this, the Midwestern barge traffic is \ncrippled by Hurricane Katrina. Do we want to put more burden on the \nagricultural sector?\n  Fixed-income seniors have little room in their monthly expenses for \nhigher air-conditioning, power, and heating bills. Do we want to hurt \nthese seniors even more?\n  Our low-income breadwinners must drive long distances from rural or \nurban low-cost housing to get to their good-paying jobs. Their gasoline \nbills have imposed a heavy tax. Do we want to hurt these vulnerable \nfamilies more?\n  We all deserve clean air. We need waters free from contamination. We \nmust have food safety. That is why this President imposed the first \nmercury emissions cuts in our Nation's history. The last administration \nhad to be sued to take action on mercury. Now President Bush is \nrequiring mercury cuts--70 percent cuts for acid-rain-causing sulfur \ndioxide, 70 percent for smog-causing nitrogen oxides, and 70 percent \nfor mercury.\n  Under the President's Clear Skies plan imposed by regulation, nearly \nevery American city will return to clean and healthy air. They will \nachieve Federal air quality standards without having to impose their \nown State or local regulations, killing jobs and hassling citizens.\n  We all care about the environment. Together, by defeating this \nmotion, we can protect the environment, protect family budgets, and \nprotect workers' jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the underlying resolution. We do \nnot need to disapprove this regulation that would move our \nenvironmental cause significantly forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD, Mr. President, mercury contamination is a critical \nenvironmental health issue. This is why I could not be more \ndisappointed about the Environmental Protection Agency's so-called \n``Utility Mercury Reductions Rule'' which was finalized in March of \nthis year. The rule jeopardizes the health of our citizens, which is \nwhy I have cosponsored Senate Joint Resolution 20, a resolution that \ndisapproves of the Administration's fatally flawed mercury rule. I will \ninclude for the Record a letter signed by 15 States, including \nWisconsin, which urges passage of S.J. Res. 20.\n  The need for stringent mercury controls has never been more urgent. \nWe know that mercury is a neurotoxin and that mercury exposure can \ncause a wide range of neurological problems and developmental delays. \nEPA's own scientists have discovered that twice as many American \nchildren are born at risk from mercury exposure than previously thought \nand the EPA has reported that 1 out of every 6 women of child-bearing \nage has so much mercury in her blood that it poses a risk to a \ndeveloping fetus. These risks should not be overlooked. We are talking \nabout the increased potential for developmental delays, lowered IQ, and \nattention and memory problems, as well as learning disabilities. In \naddition to the obvious and enormous emotional and psychological toll \nof such problems, a recently released peer-reviewed Mount Sinai School \nof Medicine study found that mercury-related brain development problems \nin children cost the United States more than $2 billion annually. \nDespite the well-documented health risks posed by mercury emissions, \nespecially to women and children, the administration has moved forward \nwith this flawed rule.\n  Thirteen million acres of lakes and 760,000 miles of rivers across \nthe country have been contaminated by mercury emissions. In fact, in an \nattempt to protect their citizens, 45 States across the country have \nissued fish consumption advisories related to mercury. Anglers are \nwarned against eating the very fish they catch because of widespread \nmercury contamination. Sadly, every one of the 15,057 lakes in my home \nState of Wisconsin is under a mercury-related warning, so I understand \nthis problem all too well. And even if Wisconsinites didn't eat the \nfish they caught inside our State, many of them would still be at risk, \naccording to EPA and Food and Drug Administration warnings, if they \ndecided to consume saltwater species like tuna, shellfish, or \nswordfish. Given the situation in Wisconsin, I was not surprised when \nthe State joined nine other States earlier this year in a lawsuit to \nforce the\n\n[[Page S9917]]\n\nadministration to scrap the mercury emissions rule. And still, even in \nthe face of widespread mercury contamination of our streams, rivers, \nlakes, and even oceans, and outcry from many States, the administration \nrefused to reconsider.\n  Unless Congress acts to disapprove the administration's rule, \nreduction in the amount of mercury emitted will be substantially \ndelayed. Under the Clean Air Act, utilities are required to use the \nmaximum available control technology to reduce mercury emissions by \n2008. The rule we debate today--and that I hope we void--would turn \nthat clock back by 10 years to 2018 and then wouldn't even achieve a \ntarget reduction of 70 percent. A 70 percent reduction would not be met \nuntil 12 years later. Clean air and water are critical to every \nindividual's health and we cannot put off meeting our original \ndeadline. Cost effective pollution control technology exists to limit \nmercury emissions and companies are already moving forward on \ninstalling such equipment. We should encourage this innovation and move \nforward to quickly reduce the health risks we know to be associated \nwith this neurotoxin.\n  The administration's final mercury rule, with its cap and trade \nemissions proposal, also falls far short of what the Clean Air Act \nrequires to protect people all across the country. This is in part \nbecause, as noted by a National Academy of Sciences study, ``hot \nspots'' of mercury are the inevitable result of such a cap and trade \nprogram. Companies wouldn't be required to control emissions at their \nsource and could instead simply buy their way out of compliance. \nAlthough trading programs may work with other pollutants, it will not \nwork with mercury. This flawed approach will lead to highly toxic areas \npeppered throughout each state instead of across-the-board emissions \nreduction at each site.\n  I am not only disturbed by the substance of the EPA's mercury rule \nbut also by investigations that have determined that the process by \nwhich the rule was drafted was badly flawed and by the failure of EPA \nto consider all available data. First, in conducting its investigation \nof the mercury rule making process and prior to finalization of the \nrule, the EPA's Inspector General reported the rule's development was \n``compromised and, therefore, may not represent the lowest emissions \nlevel that could be achieved.'' Second, and before the rule was \nfinalized, the Governmental Accountability Office issued a report that \nseverely criticized the EPA's rulemaking process, finding that it \nviolated the Agency's own policy, as well as OMB guidance and \npresidential executive orders. Finally, the EPA chose to ignore a \nHarvard study, which had been commissioned by the EPA, that \ndemonstrated substantial public health benefits to a more stringent \nmercury rule. Taken together, the three process problems are \nunacceptable and cause for serious concern. Discouragingly, even in the \nface of these reports and data, the administration forged ahead with \nits flawed rule.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 20 is the first step in protecting our \ncitizens and the environment from the harm we know follows from mercury \nemissions. I am saddened that we must take this step, but I hope that \nwe can quickly reverse the administration's rule. Swift action by this \nbody and the House will reassure Americans that we are acting with \ntheir well-being in mind, and I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis important resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter to which I referred in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Attorneys General and Chief Environmental Officers for \n           the States of New Jersey, California, Connecticut, \n           Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \n           New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, \n           Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin,\n                                                September 8, 2005.\n     Dear Senator: As chief legal and/or environmental enforcement \n     officers for our states, we are writing to express our grave \n     concerns about the Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') \n     rulemaking regarding mercury emissions from power plants. We \n     urge you to support a bi-partisan joint resolution sponsored \n     by Senators Patrick Leahy and Susan Collins under the \n     Congressional Review Act (S.J. Res. 20), disapproving EPA's \n     attempt to exempt power plants from the stringent control \n     requirements of the hazardous air pollutants section of the \n     Clean Air Act.\n       In our view, the mercury rules fail to adequately protect \n     the public from harmful mercury emissions from coal-fired \n     power plants, which threaten the health of our nation's \n     children. Significantly, the rules fail to meet the minimum \n     requirements of the Clean Air Act at a time when the threat \n     posed by mercury to public health and the environment is \n     clear. Mercury pollution in our waterways has forced states \n     to issue fish advisories covering more than 13 million acres \n     of our lakes, and 760,000 miles of our rivers. The scope of \n     mercury exposure has led scientists to estimate that up to \n     600,000 children may be born annually in the United States \n     with neurological problems. These problems require swift and \n     effective regulatory action to limit mercury emissions in the \n     United States.\n       Section 112 of the Clean Air Act provides the framework for \n     such regulatory action by requiring the maximum achievable \n     level of pollution control on the sources of hazardous air \n     pollutants such as mercury in an expeditious time frame. \n     Unfortunately, EPA's recent rules regulating mercury seek to \n     exempt the single largest U.S. source of mercury, coal-fired \n     power plants from the requirements of section 112. Instead, \n     EPA has promulgated rules that will allow many power plants \n     to avoid any reductions in their mercury emissions, and will \n     prolong the problem of ``hot spots'' of mercury contamination \n     throughout our nation. The new rules would do little to \n     reduce mercury emissions for decades leaving our most \n     vulnerable citizens, our children, at risk.\n       The Leahy-Collins resolution is an opportunity for Congress \n     to protect our children and environment by rejecting EPA's \n     attempt to exempt power plants, and their estimated 48 tons \n     of annual mercury emissions, from the clear requirements of \n     the Clean Air Act. EPA's failure to address the threat of \n     mercury as required by the Clean Air Act has forced our \n     states to challenge the new rules in court. In light of the \n     mounting impacts of mercury emissions on public health and \n     the environment, EPA's failure also compels us to request \n     immediate Congressional action on this critical issue. We \n     strongly urge you to vote in support of the Leahy-Collins \n     resolution to require EPA to establish clean air standards \n     that comply with the law and protect public health.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n         Peter C. Harvey, Attorney General, for the State of New \n           Jersey, and on behalf of the State of California: Bill \n           Lockyer, Attorney General; the State of Connecticut: \n           Richard Blumenthal, Attorney General; the State of \n           Delaware: M. Jane Brady, Attorney General; the State of \n           Illinois: Lisa Madigan, Attorney General; the State of \n           Maine: G. Steven Rowe, Attorney General; the \n           Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Thomas F. Reilly, \n           Attorney General; the State of Minnesota: Mike Hatch, \n           Attorney General; the State of New Hampshire: Kelly A. \n           Ayotte, Attorney General; the State of New Mexico: \n           Patricia A. Madrid, Attorney General; the State of New \n           York: Eliot Spitzer, Attorney General; the Commonwealth \n           of Pennsylvania: Department of Environmental \n           Protection, Susan Shinkman, Chief Counsel; the State of \n           Rhode Island: Patrick Lynch, Attorney General; the \n           State of Vermont: William H. Sorrell, Attorney General; \n           the State of Wisconsin: Peggy A. Lautenschlager, \n           Attorney General.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my outrage that \nmy colleagues and I have to fend off yet another attack on the \nenvironment by the Bush administration. I am appalled that instead of \ntaking steps toward improving air quality by implementing stricter CAFE \nstandards, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and other positive \nmeasures, the Bush rule takes a giant step backward.\n  Indeed, the mercury rule put forth by the Bush administration takes \nAmerican environmental policy back at least 5 years. In 2000, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency determined that powerplants must be \nregulated under the Clean Air Act because they are the largest \nremaining sources of mercury pollution and are, therefore, a public \nhealth risk. Up until the spring of 2003, EPA was working toward \nfinalizing an effective regulatory policy to reduce mercury emissions \nfrom powerplants by over 90 percent beginning in 2008. But in 2003, the \nBush administration reversed course by developing this new rule that \nexempts powerplants from any regulation under the Clean Air Act. Bowing \nto industry pressure, the Bush rule will do nothing to reduce emissions \nfor at least a decade and once implemented, will only reduce mercury \nemissions to approximately one-third of what the Clean Air Act \nrequires. This decision is irresponsible in light of all of the \nevidence about the dangers of mercury emissions. Mr. President, mercury \nemissions are continuing to grow and are endangering\n\n[[Page S9918]]\n\nthe health of American families across the country.\n  I am proud to say that my State, New Jersey, has taken the helm on \nreducing its own instate emissions. Last year, New Jersey adopted \nstringent rules on mercury emissions from coal-fired powerplants, iron \nand steel melters, and municipal solid waste incinerators. New Jersey's \nrules set the goal of reducing emissions from instate coal-fired plants \nby 90 percent by the year 2007. By taking this hard line on mercury, my \nState will reduce its mercury emissions by over 1,500 pounds of mercury \neach year.\n  While New Jersey has implemented this aggressive strategy in the \nfight to protect the public from mercury exposure, the new Bush \nadministration rule undermines these efforts. More than one-third of \nmercury deposition in New Jersey comes from out-of-state sources. \nInstead of allowing more mercury emissions from coal-fired plants, \nshouldn't the Federal Government be strengthening its laws by requiring \nStates to adopt strict rules similar to New Jersey's? Instead, it is \nremoving powerplants from the list of pollution sources subject to \nstringent pollution controls under the Federal Clean Air Act. Why does \nthe administration want to undercut States, such as New Jersey, that \nare making the right decision?\n  Thankfully, New Jersey has not backed down, and stands by its goal to \nreduce mercury emissions. In fact, New Jersey spearheaded a multistate \nlawsuit challenging the EPA's rule delisting powerplants as a source of \nmercury pollution. Fourteen States have joined New Jersey's challenge \nto this rule because it violates the Clean Air Act and fails to protect \nthe public adequately from the harmful mercury emissions from coal-\nfired powerplants.\n\n  The health effects of mercury are no secret. Mercury is a known \nneurotoxin that can cause severe neurological and developmental \nproblems. Developing fetuses and children are the most vulnerable to \nthe effects of mercury contamination. The threat is so severe that the \nNational Academy of Sciences recommends that pregnant and nursing \nmothers not eat more than 6 ounces of fish per month. Even by EPA's own \nestimates, more than 600,000 infants are born each year with blood \nmercury levels higher than 5.8 parts per billion, the EPA level of \nconcern. That is 600,000 children who are at risk of harmful impacts on \ncognitive thinking, memory, attention, language, and fine motor and \nvisual spatial skills. Some studies indicate that mercury could even be \nlinked to the skyrocketing number of autism cases across the country.\n  The numbers continue to astonish. Fish from waters in 45 of our 50 \nStates have been declared unsafe to eat as a result of poisoning from \nmercury. In New Jersey alone, there are mercury consumption advisories \nfor at least one species of fish in almost every body of water in the \nState.\n  Knowing these health risks, we cannot be complacent about this new \nrule. How can we sit back and let powerplants, the Nation's worst \nmercury polluters, reduce their mercury emissions by such a drastically \ndifferent rate than what the Clean Air Act requires? This is morally \nrepugnant, irresponsible and just plain wrong.\n  We have the technology to control mercury emissions--that is not the \nproblem. The problem is that industry does not want to be accountable \nfor the costs of polluting, and the Bush administration is letting them \nget away with that. Instead, the public will incur the health costs of \nnot reducing emissions. Once again, it is clear that the administration \nhas no problem letting big industry off the hook at the expense of the \npublic's health.\n  The science is behind us and the technology available to reduce human \nexposure to mercury. We cannot retreat; we must move forward and \nprotect our Nation's children. I urge my colleagues to support the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, just over 5 short months ago, the Bush \nadministration finalized a rule that weakens and delays required \ncontrols on emissions of mercury from coal- and oil-fired powerplants. \nWe should overturn this rule today.\n  This vote presents a clear choice: does the United States Senate \nsupport protecting the health of millions of children in our nation, or \ndoes it support protecting the profits of industries that emit mercury, \nwhich poisons our children and environment?\n  The Bush administration supports the interests of polluting \nindustries. The administration's rule saves the electric industry \nmoney, but at a severe cost to public health. The administration has--\nonce again--used the Federal Environmental Protection Agency to protect \npolluters.\n  Mercury is a potent poison. Studies show that it may damage the human \ncardiovascular, endocrine, immune, and respiratory systems. It also \nharms the nervous systems of developing fetuses. Low levels of mercury \nexposure in utero can damage a fetus's brain and create long-term \ninjuries, including learning disabilities, poor academic performance, \nand reduced capacity to do everyday activities like drawing and \nlearning to speak.\n  Up to 637,000 children are born each year having already been exposed \nto levels of mercury associated with brain damage.\n  Just last week, on Sept. 8, 2005, the Center for Children's Health \nand the Environment, located at Mount Sinai Medical Center, found that \nmore than 1,500 babies suffer from metal retardation due to mercury \nexposure in utero. In addition to the life-long personal impacts, the \nstudy found that the nation loses $2 billion annually from such \ninjuries.\n  Forty-five States warn people to reduce or avoid consumption of fish \nfrom waterbodies that contain mercury due to the risk associated with \neating these fish. Mercury levels become concentrated in some fish, \nreaching more than one million times the level of mercury in the water.\n  Where does this mercury come from? Powerplants are the single largest \nsource of U.S. emissions of mercury, accounting for 44 percent of all \nsuch emissions. These powerplants emit 30 percent of the mercury that \ncurrently pollutes U.S. waters. Fish contaminated with mercury is the \nmain source of exposure for people in our nation.\n  The Clean Air Act requires reductions in mercury emissions that are \ncrucial to protect public health. But, the Bush administration has \ndecided to ignore the law.\n  EPA's rule on coal- and oil-fired powerplants implements slower and \nweaker requirements than under the Clean Air Act. This ill-advised rule \ndelays reductions for 10 years and allows higher emissions of mercury, \ncompared to the Clean Air Act's requirements. EPA's projected \nreductions in emissions under the rule do not meet the reductions \nrequired by the Clean Air Act. And, in fact, this chart shows the \nreductions do not even meet what the rule itself calls for.\n  Why did the EPA get it so wrong?\n  Well, for starters, EPA used language from utility-industry lawyers--\nalmost word for word--to create the rule.\n  On September 22, 2004, the Washington Posted reported that:\n\n       For the third time, environmental advocates discovered \n     passages in the Bush administration's proposal for regulating \n     mercury pollution from power plants that mirror almost word \n     for word portions of memos written by a law firm representing \n     coal-fired power plants. . . . The EPA used nearly identical \n     language in its rule, changing just eight words. In a \n     separate section, the agency used the same italics [the law \n     firm] used in their memo  . . .\n\n  Let me repeat the last part. The industry memo and the rule that EPA \nproposed even used the same italics.\n  What else did EPA do wrong?\n  The EPA's own inspector general found that senior EPA officials told \ncareer EPA staff to produce a rule that allowed 34 tons of annual \nmercury emissions, rather than to produce a rule that complied with the \nlaw.\n  Let me quote from a 2005 EPA inspector general report that examined \nEPA's mercury rule:\n\n       Evidence indicates that EPA senior management instructed \n     EPA staff to develop a Maximum Achievable Control Technology \n     (MACT) standard for mercury that would result in national \n     emissions of 34 tons annually, instead of basing the standard \n     on an unbiased determination of what the top performing units \n     were achieving in practice.\n\n  Again, this bears repeating: Senior EPA officials rigged the \nrulemaking to allow the power industry to emit a heavy metal that can \npoison children.\n  But, it doesn't end there.\n  Both EPA's inspector general and Congress's Government Accountability \nOffice found that EPA failed to assess all of the public health \nbenefits of reducing mercury. EPA ignored demands\n\n[[Page S9919]]\n\nfrom its own Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee and other \npublic health groups to asses such injuries.\n  Let me quote from a January 4, 2005 letter that the Advisory \nCommittee wrote to the EPA:\n\n       While we are pleased to see that EPA is considering \n     additional external analyses, we note that EPA has not \n     conducted the analysis recommended by [the Children's Health \n     Protection Advisory Committee] . . . Specially, we asked the \n     Agency to develop `an integrated analysis with respect to \n     whether emissions reductions under either of these proposals \n     are the most child-protective, timely, and cost-effective,' \n     using existing available data. . . . The [Children's Health \n     Protection Advisory Committee] notes that none of the [EPA's] \n     Principle questions for consideration [of the rule] addresses \n     the importance of healthy child development in assessing a \n     country's economic competitiveness.\n\n  The Advisory Committee wrote four letters admonishing the EPA to \nconduct the needed analysis and increase protections for children.\n  Did EPA listen? No. EPA unlawfully allowed industry to emit poison, \nand then turned a blind eye to the injuries suffered by the children \nwho will be hurt most from this decision.\n  In this rule, EPA chose not to require coal and oil-fired powerplants \nto make the same types of reductions that medical and municipal waste \nincinerators have made. These facilities, which emit mercury, have \nreduced their emissions by 90 percent using the maximum achievable \ncontrol technologies.\n  EPA got it wrong by cooking the books, using industry-supplied \nlanguage, willfully ignoring the most severe public health impacts, and \nsimply refusing to make powerful industries comply with the same rules \nas other entities.\n  We must reject EPA's rule to delist these facilities as emitters of \nhazardous air pollutants. The Senate must join with the religious \ncommunity, public health advocates, fishermen and hunters, \nenvironmental groups and more than a dozen states in opposing this \nrule.\n  We must vote to protect public health, not the profits of the power \nindustry.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I regret having to miss the vote on the \nCollins-Leahy mercury resolution on the floor today; however, I am in \nLouisiana delivering supplies to the victims of Hurricane Katrina. It \nis my understanding that my absence will not affect the outcome of this \nvote.\n  The scientific evidence regarding the role that mercury contamination \nplays in public health and the environment speaks to the importance of \nthis issue. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin harmful to fetuses' and \ninfants' nervous systems. Frighteningly, one in six women of \nchildbearing age in the United States carries enough accumulated \nmercury in her body to pose risks of adverse health effects to her \nchildren should she become pregnant. But it doesn't end there. A recent \nstudy found links between mercury and childhood developmental \ndisabilities such as autism. Forty-five States have fish advisories for \nmercury warning pregnant women and children to limit their consumption \nof many fish caught in freshwater. And researchers have warned that \nmercury is associated with cardiovascular disease in adult men.\n  Facing this threat to the environment and our public health, the Bush \nEPA has failed. Whether through effort or error, it has repeatedly \ntaken its lead from regulated industries, overlooked sound science, and \nput the demands of the special interest ahead of the public interest. \nEPA has indefensibly purported to overturn its obligation under the \nClean Air Act to adopt far more protective mercury regulations by 2008. \nSimultaneously the Agency has substituted far weaker measures that do \nnot require any specific mercury reductions before 2018, and even then \ndelay the ultimate reductions for an additional decade.\n  As Members of the Senate, we have a unique opportunity under the \nCongressional Review Act to send the mercury powerplant rule back to \nthe EPA for a thorough review. Only through a new rulemaking can we \nhope to develop a scientifically sound proposal that will protect the \npublic health, protect the economy and give the public any confidence \nin the regulatory process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time, not to use the \nremaining time Senator Leahy has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we do not have a lot of rivers in Nevada. We \nhave very few. The little river we love a great deal is called the \nCarson River. It is a wonderful place to fly fish. But there are signs \nposted in various places on the Carson River warning of the danger of \nmercury.\n  Mercury in Nevada is a problem, as it is in 44 other States. Forty-\nfour States, including Nevada, have warnings urging residents to avoid \neating mercury-laden fish caught in lakes, rivers, and streams.\n  I first want to thank Senators Leahy and Collins for bringing the \nmercury pollution rule resolution of disapproval to the floor today.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that can affect the brain, heart, and \nimmune system. Developing fetuses and children are especially at risk, \nand even low-level exposure to mercury can cause learning disabilities, \ndevelopmental delays, and other problems.\n  Mercury's impact on public health has been well documented. EPA \nscientists estimate that one in six pregnant women in the United States \nhas enough mercury in her body to put her child at risk. That is too \nbad.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has recommended that children and \nwomen of childbearing age eat no more than two meals of fish per week \nand to avoid eating certain fish altogether.\n  Powerplants are the largest emitter of mercury in the United States, \nemitting over 40 percent of the total mercury emissions.\n  On March 29, 2005, the Bush administration issued the final rules \nthat give powerplants a pass on mercury emissions for years, delaying \nmodest reductions until the year 2018.\n  Every time I hear the Clear Skies Initiative, it reminds me of the \nbook ``1984.'' That is Orwellian. That legislation does everything \nexcept clean the air. The American people want air they can breathe \nthat is safe. They want water they can drink. Delaying these reductions \nuntil 2018 does not do that.\n  Earlier this year, the EPA Inspector General and the Government \nAccountability Office found that the EPA failed to analyze the health \nimpact and ignored scientific evidence to establish a predetermined and \nless protective mercury rule favored by the Bush administration \npolitical appointees.\n  This is not some partisan harangue. This is from the Inspector \nGeneral of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Government \nAccountability Office, the watchdog of this body, the Congress.\n  Ten States have filed lawsuits against the EPA saying the rules \ncertainly do not go far enough. In addition, thousands of sportsmen's \ngroups--thousands of sportsmen's groups--public health groups, \nenvironmental groups, and religious organizations oppose the Bush \nadministration mercury rule.\n  EPA rules that allow mercury emissions to continue are a danger to \npublic health. This great Nation cannot compromise health simply to \nprotect the financial interests of utilities. That is why we should \nreject the administration's mercury rules and send the EPA back to the \ndrawing board to write a rule that complies with the law and protects \nour health.\n  So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for the Leahy-Collins \nmercury rule disapproval resolution. Forty-four States have warnings \nurging residents to avoid eating mercury-laden fish caught in their \nrivers, lakes, and streams. Mr. President, that says it all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Delaware is in the \nChamber. If he would like to go ahead, it would be acceptable.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is still available to the \nSenator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 3 minutes. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n\n[[Page S9920]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, others have spoken this evening of the health threat \nthat is posed to our young, the unborn, and to pregnant women. I am not \ngoing to belabor those points. They have been well made.\n  Senator Reid mentioned there is a river in his State where you can't \neat the fish because of the mercury content. Ironically, last Friday, I \nwas on a river that literally flows through Wilmington, DE. If you ever \ncome up I-95, through Wilmington, up on the train through Wilmington in \nthe Northeast Corridor, you go right by the Christina River. I was out \non the Christina River this last weekend with one of our former \nGovernors, Russell Peterson. You can't eat the fish, or at least you \nshouldn't eat the fish in the Christina River. There are several other \nrivers in my State which have a similar ban in effect. One of the \nproblems with the fish is they have mercury in them.\n  One of the problems with the rule the President has suggested, a \nstrict cap-and-trade approach with respect to mercury--the problem I \nhave, the concern I have is, let's say you have a high mercury-emitting \npowerplant here, and you have a lower one here. If the folks who have \nthe higher emitting plant want to continue to emit a lot of mercury, \nthey can do that under the strict cap-and-trade approach. They can say: \nWe will find a way in another part of the country to reduce mercury \nemissions and use that to trade off the high-emitting utility.\n  The problem, for me at least, with a strict cap-and-trade approach is \nmercury hot spots. Cap and trade is fine, but I think we would be much \nsmarter to have an approach that almost every utility--which is burning \nwhatever fuel it is, coal or some other, to create electricity--that \nalmost everybody would have to reduce to some extent their mercury \nemissions.\n\n  Is it technically feasible? As it turns out, it is. We had in our \ncommittee about 2 years ago testimony from companies such as WL Gore \nthat they have the ability to reduce mercury emissions by 40, 50, 60, \n70 percent. I just learned from my staff there is an outfit, a \nColorado-based company, ADA Environmental, that has been awarded \ncontracts to install new mercury-control technologies in two \npowerplants being built in the Midwest. I think they are looking for \nmercury emission reductions by as much as 80 percent.\n  This is not something we will only be able to do in 2018 or 2017 or \n2016. These are emission reductions that are achievable in the next \ncouple of years. It is all well and good we want to reduce emissions in \n2018 by 70 percent. We can do better than that. We ought to do better \nthan that.\n  There is a balance that is achievable. The balance involves reducing \nthe level of mercury emissions and at the same time not causing further \nspikes in the price of natural gas. We can do both, and we need to do \nboth.\n  The rule this administration submitted to us and has promulgated does \nnot do both. We can do better than that. My hope is in our committee we \nwill be able to do that before long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, let me advise everyone where we are right now. We will be \nhaving a vote at the conclusion of my remarks on the motion to proceed. \nTomorrow there will be actually a vote on the resolution. And tomorrow \nis the significant vote. There has been a lot of talk about today's \nmotion, but tomorrow's is very significant.\n  I have to say it appears to me this is highly politically charged, \nthat we would be talking about this at this time. Of course, we have \nthe confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice, as the Senator from \nVermont knows. He is very diligently involved in that confirmation \nprocess. We have the catastrophe down in Alabama and Mississippi and \nLouisiana. Yet we are taking time to do this.\n  I have to ask the question, Is there anyone in this Chamber who \nbelieves the President would sign legislation to repeal his own \nadministration's rule? As the Senator from Ohio pointed out, the \nPresident has already announced he is going to veto this resolution in \nthe event it passes. So we are not really accomplishing anything.\n  I have to say, this is hardly the time to discuss overturning an \nexisting clean air regulation that relies on an approach that is proven \nto be effective. There were sceptics back when acid rain came along as \nto the cap-and-trade procedure. It has worked; we know that.\n  Let's look at the economics for a minute. No one has talked about \nthat.\n  This resolution is intended to force the Environmental Protection \nAgency to impose a very costly and potentially devastating regulation \nin place of the existing Clean Air Mercury Rule, which relies on an \nalready well-proven market-based approach, as I just mentioned. The \ncurrent EPA approach will cut mercury emissions by 70 percent--70 \npercent--at an estimated cost of $2 billion. Supporters of this \nresolution prefer a maximum achievable control technology--MACT--\nstandard which is not nearly as cost effective.\n  Supporters also want the MACT standard to cut mercury by 90 percent. \nThe independent Energy Information Administration has found that the \nimplementation of a 90-percent MACT standard within 3 years would cost \nup to $358 billion. I did not say ``million,'' I said ``billion.''\n  The additional $356 billion of the MACT--which is much more than the \ncurrent rule will cost--is projected to only reduce mercury deposition \nin the United States by about 2 percent more than the current \nregulation. As we can see from the chart that is behind us, 22-percent \nhigher electricity prices and costs would be $358 billion.\n  A 90-percent MACT would have devastating consequences on natural gas \nsupplies which are already in a crisis. According to the EIA, the \nEnergy Information Administration, it could increase by 10 percent the \nnatural gas used by utilities that are forced to fuel switch. The \nSenator from Ohio talked about the fact they would have to switch from \ncoal to natural gas. I think everyone understands that would happen.\n  This would also cripple industries that rely on natural gas, such as \nthe chemical industry, which has already lost 90,000 jobs since the \nyear 2000 due in large part to the rising cost of natural gas. We have \ntalked about that on the Senate floor. We discussed that in our \ncommittee, the EPW Committee.\n  This last weekend I was in Lawton, Altus, and Frederick, OK. That is \nin the far southwestern part of the State. The farmers down there have \nreceived through their organizations what would be the increased cost \nof fertilizer. One of the main components of fertilizer is natural gas. \nThey really cannot take any more hits. So it goes far beyond just the \nchemical industry.\n  The most effective, most flexible, and least burdensome way to \nachieve mercury reduction is to build on the most successful part of \nthe Clean Air Act, the acid rain program. Many Senators resisted the \nacid rain program, saying there would be hot spots and compliance \nproblems, yet there have been no hot spots and, unlike with most of the \nClean Air Act, virtually no enforcement problems. As the senior Senator \nfrom Vermont said in 1999:\n\n       When we were debating controls for acid rain, we heard a \n     lot about the enormous cost of eliminating sulfur dioxide. \n     But what we learned from the acid rain program is that when \n     you give industry a financial incentive to clean up its act, \n     they will find the cheapest way of doing it.\n\n  I think he was correct. That is exactly what the current rule under \nwhich we are operating does, the cap and trade, similar to the \nsuccessful program that was used in acid rain. Moreover, supporters of \nthe resolution that is under consideration assume the cap and trade \nmercury rule would be replaced with a 90-percent MACT rule. When the \nEPA first proposed the cap and trade approach last year, it also \nproposed a MACT approach. The MACT it proposed as complying with the \nlaw would only cut mercury emissions by 29 percent--not 90 percent, 29 \npercent. Yet here we have a rule that cuts mercury by 70 percent, and \nit costs less because it uses cap and trade. Why would the sponsors of \nthis resolution want to get only a 29-percent reduction in mercury?\n  Actual deposition and its variety of sources are rarely discussed. \nMercury emissions are not exclusive to powerplants. In fact, U.S. \npowerplants contribute but 1 percent of the global\n\n[[Page S9921]]\n\ntotal, according to Josef Pacyna of the Norwegian Institute of Air \nResearch, as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An \nenormous amount originates in Asia. More than half of mercury emissions \nare nationally occurring. Given that statistic, mercury will be present \nin the human bloodstream regardless of whether powerplants are \nregulated by a cap and trade emissions reduction program or the more \ncostly but less effective MACT standard--or, for that matter, even if \nall powerplants and manufacturing facilities in the country were to be \nshut down altogether.\n  EPA data shows that eliminating U.S. powerplants from the mercury \ndeposition equation would have virtually no effect on reducing actual \ndeposition. Throughout New England, for example, the range of \ndeposition levels would be unchanged. With or without powerplants, \ndeposition levels are between 10 and 15 micrograms per square meter in \nthe overwhelming majority of the area. Where there is a reduction, the \namount is negligible.\n  These four charts created by the EPA using state-of-the-art computer \nmodeling tell the story. As you can see in chart No. 5, throughout the \ncountry mercury deposition from all sources ranges from as low as 5 to \n10 micrograms, up to more than 20 micrograms per square meter. The next \nchart, in contrast, shows that powerplants contribute less than 1 \nmicrogram per square meter for most of the country, including virtually \nthe entire United States. Nonetheless, it is true that in most of the \nEast, powerplants are responsible for 1 to 10 micrograms per square \nmeter of the deposition. In a small region of the country, they cause \nas much as 10 to 20 micrograms. That is why the EPA has issued its \nregulation.\n  The next chart, however, is revealing. With the EPA's rule, \npowerplants will contribute less than 1 microgram in the vast majority \nof the country and less than 5 micrograms anywhere else. Clearly, the \nEPA rule is effective. Yet despite the effectiveness of the EPA rule, \nsome are advocating overturning a 70-percent emission reduction in the \nhopes of eking out a slightly greater reduction of 90 percent.\n  This last chart, No. 8, completes the story. Even if all powerplants \nin the country were shut down, mercury deposition would be at least 5 \nto 10 micrograms; that is, if we shut down all powerplants. All we are \naddressing now is powerplants, and a lot of people are deceived into \nthinking that powerplants is where you get your problem with mercury. \nThat is not it. One percent of the total is in powerplants. Even if all \npowerplants in the country were shut down, mercury deposition would be \nat least 5 to 10 micrograms. In half the country, it is 10 to 15 \nmicrograms. In a significant portion of the country, it ranges from 15 \nto more than 20 micrograms.\n  Look at this chart. Now go back to chart 3. It is incredible that \nsome Senators are willing to roll back EPA's current rule when \ndeposition from powerplants will be negligible compared to other \nsources. EPA believes we should act now to reduce emissions of mercury \nfrom the powerplants so we can achieve the progress you see in chart \nNo. 7. Repealing the section 111 rule would be a step backward in our \nefforts to regulate mercury emissions from powerplants. It would create \nenormous uncertainty for the States. Keep in mind that prior to 6 \nmonths ago, when the President came out with a cap and trade \nrestriction on mercury, we had no restriction on mercury in \npowerplants. It was nonexistent. In the absence of the mercury rule, \nthere will be no Federal regulation of mercury from existing \npowerplants, at least in the foreseeable future. Repealing EPA's rule \nwould roll back the 70-percent reductions required by the agency and \neliminate incentives for the development of new mercury-specific \ncontrol technologies.\n  It is not appropriate for Congress to address this issue. The very \npeople who claim that EPA acted improperly have asked the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals to review the EPA's action to determine if their \nactions were proper or improper. The court would thoroughly review the \nlegal and factual basis for the EPA's determination. There is no reason \nfor Congress to interfere with this process. Congress can take \naffirmative action on mercury emissions by passing the Clear Skies \nlegislation.\n  We went through this. We have been working for 2 years to get the \nPresident's Clear Skies legislation passed. Clear Skies legislation \nmandates a 70-percent reduction in SOX, NOX, and \nin mercury. And for some reason those individuals who claim to be \nconcerned about the environment would rather have no mandated reduction \nat all. We have the opportunity now to do that. Clear Skies cuts \nmercury emissions from the power section by 70 percent. The President's \nClear Skies legislation is a more effective, long-term mechanism to \nachieve large scale national reductions of not only mercury but sulfur \ndioxide and nitrogen oxides. Clear Skies legislation applies nationwide \nand is modeled on the highly successful acid rain program, a program \nmany people have said was not going to work, was not going to be \neffective. Yet we all now realize it was effective.\n  We are not talking about just mercury. We are talking about sulfur \ndioxide, nitrogen oxide. I believe it would be totally irresponsible to \nsomehow roll back the first attempt that we have to regulate mercury in \npowerplants. Keep in mind, prior to 6 months ago, it was not regulated \nat all. That is what this is all about.\n  Tonight is a vote on the motion to proceed. I don't care about the \nmotion to proceed. Let's go ahead and vote in favor of that. Tomorrow \nis the main vote. That is a significant vote. I think we need to \nproceed to that vote tomorrow.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9921-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to express \nopposition to the resolution that we are going to be voting on tomorrow \nmorning. First, for the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to \nexplain that to be effective the resolution must be passed by the \nSenate and the House and signed by the President. While the act \nprovides for expedited and privileged procedures in the Senate, there \nare not such rules in the House. I have every reason to believe this \nresolution will not be considered by the House, and even if it is \nconsidered by the House and passed, the President has announced today \nthat he would veto this legislation. So it is clear where this is \ngoing.\n  What are we talking about? On March 15 of this year, EPA finalized \nthe clean air mercury rule and made the United States the first nation \nin the world to regulate mercury emissions from existing coal-fired \npowerplants. That is the first in the world. We know we have coal-fired \npowerplants all over the world--China, India, all over. Through two \nphases in a program called cap and trade, mercury emissions will be \nreduced by 70 percent. The program is modeled after the Nation's most \nsuccessful clean air program, the Acid Rain Program. There were not any \nlawsuits filed, and it went through and made a big difference in terms \nof reducing acid rain.\n  Modeling by the Electric Power Research Institute, an independent \nnonprofit research organization, shows that the rule is going to reduce \nmercury in every State. This is quite amazing given the nature of \nmercury.\n  Let us talk about mercury and where it comes from because the debate \nearlier this evening gave the impression that all of the mercury that \npeople are experiencing today in the United States comes from the \nUnited States. Not so. Mercury travels hundreds and thousands of miles. \nAbout 55 percent of worldwide mercury emissions come from natural \nsources such as oceans and volcanoes. So it is already in the \nenvironment. Only 1 percent of worldwide emissions come from U.S. \npowerplants, which is what we are talking about today.\n  From 1990 to 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that \nU.S. emissions of mercury were reduced by nearly half. So we have been \ndoing some real good, and that has been completely offset by increases \nin emissions from Asia.\n  As many of my colleagues know, throughout my career I have focused a \nlot of my time and energy on the Great Lakes. In a report published \nafter a workshop sponsored by the International Air Quality Advisory \nBoard of the International Joint Commission--the International Joint \nCommission is made up of U.S. and Canadian representatives and the \nCommission for Environmental Cooperation--I learned that as much as 45 \npercent of the mercury disposition in the Great Lakes is believed to \ncome from Asia.\n  We have had some discussion today about mercury control technology. I \nwould like to share with my colleagues that the testing performed by \nthe Department of Energy, EPA, and the electric utility industry has \ndemonstrated that existing control equipment for sulfur dioxide, \nnitrogen oxide, and particulate matter can reduce mercury emissions by \napproximately 40 percent. In other words, if we do a better job of \nreducing NOX and SOX, we will have a real impact \non the reduction of mercury in the United States.\n  According to the DOE's national environmental technology laboratory, \nthe ability of these existing pollution controls to reduce mercury can \nvary from zero levels approaching 90 percent. In fact, some \ncombinations of control technologies for reasons unexplained show an \nincrease in mercury emissions.\n  So the status of the technology is really fuzzy. If mercury \ntechnology is so settled, as my colleagues would lead many to believe, \nthen why is the Department of Energy supporting 36 mercury control \nprojects located in 12 States--California, Washington, Alabama, \nPennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, West Virginia, Colorado, North Dakota, \nNorth Carolina, and Iowa.\n  Additionally, Green Wire published an article, by the way, that was \nreferenced by the Senator from Delaware, where the first sentence \nreads: A leading technology for removing mercury from the coal \ncombustion process will be fully applied for the first time to a \ncommercial scale powerplant. So this is proven technology of one or two \nout of more than a thousand coal-fired units are going to install it.\n  In other words, we have a couple of plants that they are talking \nabout doing something in terms of this mercury technology. The vendor \nthat is going to install this technology on two plants in the Midwest \nhas said their target is 80 percent.\n  Those who are promoting the resolution want a 90-percent reduction \nwithin 3 years. Now, here is somebody who is out there in front on \ntechnology, and they are talking about their target being 80 percent. \nThe President's regulation, EPA regulation, is a reduction of 70 \npercent.\n  So let us look at this. Two plants out of more than 1,000 coal-fired \nplants. I am not sure that one could argue with a straight face that \nthe technology is out there to do what the sponsors of this resolution \nwould say that they could do.\n  According to the DOE, currently no single technology exists that can \nuniformly control mercury from all powerplant gas emissions. For that \nreason, the EPA concluded that mercury-specific control technologies \nare not yet commercially available and does not believe widely \napplicable technologies can be developed and broadly applied over the \nnext 5 years.\n  The sponsors of this resolution, as I mentioned, are for something \ncalled the Maximum Available Control Technology. They want a 90-percent \nreduction in 3 to 4 years. First of all, the technology is not there, \nbut let's say what would happen if it were there. EPA's cap-and-trade \nprogram, the one that is reflected in the regulation that EPA promoted \non mercury, is going to cost $2 billion, while the regulation of the \nsponsors of this regulation would cost $358 billion. That is not \nmillion; we are talking about $2 billion versus $358 billion.\n  Utilities will be forced to increase their use of natural gas by \nalmost 30 percent because natural gas is the only means available at \nthe present time to achieve significant mercury reductions within such \na short timeframe. Natural gas prices will increase by over 20 percent. \nNational average electricity prices will increase by 20 percent. Some \nregions of the United States, especially those that rely on coal, are \nprojected to experience electricity price increases as much as 45 \npercent.\n  I have to say that I come from the State of Ohio. I live in \nCleveland, OH. We have seen our natural gas prices increase almost 100 \npercent since 2001. In fact, I believe that is when the recession \nstarted in my State. This is impacting dramatically on those people who \nare the least able to pay. It is impacting dramatically on the \nbusinesses in my State and, frankly, throughout the United States of \nAmerica. I suspect it is also impacting on those people in the \nNortheastern part of the United States, the home of many of those who \nare sponsoring this resolution to overturn the EPA rule on mercury.\n  Let's talk about natural gas prices. According to the independent \nEnergy\n\n[[Page S9923]]\n\nInformation Administration, a maximum standard would have a devastating \nimpact on our Nation because coal plants, unable to attain it, would be \nforced to fuel switch away from coal, which is our most abundant and \nleast costly energy source, to natural gas.\n  One of the things my colleagues need to understand is that we are the \nSaudi Arabia of coal. We have 250 years' worth of coal here in the \nUnited States. There are some people, frankly, who would like to see \ncoal put out of business. In fact, the lawyer for the Sierra Club \nindicated about a year ago that it is their goal to make sure that we \nno longer have any coal-fired facilities, energy plants in the United \nStates.\n  Increased reliance on natural gas for electricity generation will add \nto the cost, as we have already seen. We have the highest natural gas \nprices in the developed world today. Increased costs have diminished \nour businesses' competitive position in the global marketplace.\n  I was saying earlier today, some of my colleagues are living in a \ncocoon. The biggest threat to the United States, and we don't recognize \nit, is that we have the most fierce competition this country has ever \nconfronted in my memory today, and we still go about dealing with our \nproblems the way we did 25 or 15 years ago. We have to understand that \ndecisions we make not only impact on the people in our Nation, but they \nalso impact on the competitive position of the United States in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  The Energy Information Agency, which is part of the Department of \nEnergy, estimates that natural gas prices may go up as much as 71 \npercent in some parts this fall. Did you hear me? That is 71 percent. \nTalk to the people in Cleveland or in Columbus or other parts of the \nUnited States who have had it up to here with their natural gas costs. \nIt will place a burden on the poor and elderly and on American \nbusinesses both large and small. EIA finds that the use of natural gas \nfor electricity generation may increase up to 10 percent by 2025, with \nnationwide electricity prices expected to rise by as much as 22 \npercent.\n  The repercussions of high natural gas prices do not end with higher \nenergy prices for individuals and businesses. What we forget about is \nnatural gas--this is something I think the American people have to \nunderstand--is a vital feedstock for many industries in the United \nStates. Since 1999, 21 nitrogen fertilizer production facilities have \nclosed, 16 of them permanently. As a result, farmers are paying up to \n70 percent more for nitrogen fertilizer materials than they did before, \nand that is reflected of course in the price we pay for corn and for \nother crops that use fertilizer.\n  The chemical industry had an eight-decade run as a major exporter; \nthat is, we exported chemical products all over the world. That ended \nin 2003. With a $19 billion trade surplus in 1997--that is $19 billion \nwe are selling--it went to a $9.6 billion deficit. That means today we \nare importing chemical products into the United States. More than \n90,000 U.S. chemical industry jobs have been lost since 2000. Of the \n125 large-scale chemical production plants under construction \nworldwide, 50 are in China, while only 1 is in the United States.\n  This is another example, because of our policy, of jobs shifting out \nof this country to other countries.\n\n  Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this resolution for me is that \nit completely circumvents the Environment and Public Works Committee \nand the subcommittee I chair. That subcommittee is the Clean Air \nSubcommittee of the Environment and Public Works Committee Climate \nControl and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Disregarding our \ncommittee's jurisdiction and extensive work on this matter, with a \ntotal of 24 hearings held on emissions issues since 1998, S.J. Res. 20 \nwas discharged from the EPA Commission by a petition, not by a vote of \nits members. In fact, the committee worked hard during the first few \nmonths of this year to pass the Clear Skies Act to reduce emissions of \nmercury, NOx and sulfur dioxide. Unfortunately, several of my \ncolleagues simply did not want a bill and were unable to compromise so \nwe would be able to move the bill out of committee.\n  It is astounding that many of the Members who are now supporters of \nthis resolution on which we will vote tomorrow--if Members want to \nreduce emissions sooner or even through a different mechanism, then \nlet's work together and pass a multi-emissions bill that deals with \nSOX, NOX, and mercury, as proposed in the \nPresident's Clear Skies Initiative on which we agreed to compromise and \nnow we are dealing with one part of it.\n  Instead, proponents of this resolution are taking a step backward. At \nthe least, passage of this resolution means that the Clean Air Mercury \nRule would be repealed and there would be years of delay before a new \nregulation would be developed, proposed, finalized, and then \nimplemented after resolving the inevitable litigation.\n  I want to point out the beginning of this rule--in other words coming \nup with a mercury rule--started in the Clinton administration 15 years \nago.\n  Some arguments have also been advanced that the resolution would \neliminate any legal requirement that EPA even promulgate a regulation \nto control mercury emissions from powerplants. This resolution is not \nthe right way to get actual reductions. EPW Committee Chairman Jim \nInhofe and I showed earlier this year that we are willing, as I \nmentioned, to sit down at the table and work through a multi-emissions \nbill. We made changes in the committee to address every concern raised \nand we are willing to do more, but frankly no member of the opposing \nside told us what is wrong with our proposal and what would be needed \nfor them to support our bill. We got nowhere.\n  Our managers' amendment to Clear Skies is stronger on mercury than \nthe Rule. We move up the second phase from 2018 to 2016, and create a \nhotspot program to address concerns that people have with our cap-and-\ntrade program.\n  The last thing I would like to get at is there are being represented \nall kinds of statistics on how mercury is impacting the population of \nthe United States, particularly women of childbearing age.\n  I want to point out the major sponsors of this resolution live up in \nthis area of the United States. The disposition of mercury in \nmicrograms per square meter is less than 1 in this area, where they are \ncomplaining about all the mercury and how it is impacting on their \nlakes and streams and on their population. The people who have the \nproblem are in Pennsylvania and Ohio--this blue area on the map. They \nare the ones who have the mercury problem. As I mentioned before, a lot \nof it has to do with mercury that is coming from other places in the \nworld. The Clear Skies legislation that we put together was going to \ndeal with this problem. But, oh, no, it is our way or no way; we have \nto have something that is perfect.\n  The thing we do here so often in the Senate is we allow the perfect \nto get in the way of the good. We better realize we are going to need \nmore compromising if we are going to do the things we want to do, to \nreduce emissions in the air and at the same time stay competitive in \nthe global marketplace.\n  I am going to finish with a little information on the risks of \nmercury. We have heard all of the gloom and doom and how terrible it is \nand we can't eat the fish and we can't do this and we can't do that.\n  EPA's reference dose for methylmercury is the basis for regulating \nmercury because methylmercury poses the greatest risks of exposure to \npeople, including women of childbearing age. Understand that. EPA's \nreference dose for methylmercury is very conservative. It is more than \ntwice as stringent as that of the World Health Organization; twice as \nstringent as Health Canada; three times more stringent than the Agency \nfor Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.\n  In other words, the rule that we have is more stringent. First of \nall, it is the first real rule we have in terms of the world dealing \nwith mercury. But compared to the one some of these other organizations \nhave stated, it is so much better than what they have put out as being \nthe goal. The National Academy of Sciences concluded that EPA's \nreference dose is a ``scientifically justifiable level for the \nprotection of public health.'' EPA's analysis\n\n[[Page S9924]]\n\nconcluded that, as a result--we are talking about the Environmental \nProtection Agency. We keep hearing that the inspector general of the \nEPA does not like this. The agency the inspector general works for \ndisagrees with the inspector general.\n  As I said, the National Academy of Science scientists concluded that \nEPA's reference dose is ``a scientifically justifiable level for the \nprotection of public health.'' EPA's analysis concluded that as a \nresult of the cap-and-trade program:\n\n     . . . the overwhelming majority of the general public and \n     those who consume large quantities of fish--\n\n  And I consume large quantities of fish because Lake Erie is one of \nthe best fisheries in the United States of America. We eat a lot of \nperch in the Voinovich household--\n\n     are not expected to be exposed above the methylmercury \n     reference dose.\n\n  Additionally, while several of my colleagues and groups claim that \nthere is an urgent need to dramatically reduce mercury emissions \nbecause many are at serious risk, this is simply not the case. Two \nmonths ago, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released \ntheir ``Third National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental \nChemicals,'' stating that all women of childbearing age--16 to 49 years \nof age--had blood mercury levels below that associated with the neuro-\ndevelopmental effects in the fetus.\n  We have been hearing lots of information and statistics about this \nissue. The fact of the matter is that the EPA rule on mercury is \nreasonable. It will cost $2 billion, versus $385 billion.\n  It has been shown, if we went with what the sponsors of this \nresolution want to do--that is, overturn the mercury rule of EPA--if \nthey got everything they wanted, we would have a 2-percent reduction \nbelow what we are going to get with this 70 percent rule that has been \npromulgated by the EPA.\n  I hope my colleagues spend a little time looking at this situation \nand its impact and tomorrow vote no on the proposed resolution to \noverturn the EPA's mercury rule.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9924-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO CRAIG WILLIAMS AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS WORKING GROUP\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great \nKentuckian and the fine organization he represents--Mr. Craig Williams \nand the Chemical Weapons Working Group, CWWG, based in Madison County, \nKY.\n  For almost 20 years, Craig and the CWWG have been invaluable in their \nefforts to ensure that the millions of pounds of chemical weapons \nstored at Kentucky's Blue Grass Army Depot are destroyed as safely and \nexpeditiously as possible. In large part due to their efforts, we are \ncloser than we have ever been to taking tangible steps towards chemical \nweapons disposal.\n  One of our biggest challenges has been to keep those in charge of \nweapons disposal at the Department of Defense, DOD, accountable to the \ncitizens of Kentucky. It hasn't been easy. Without the efforts and \ndiligence of Craig and his organization, it would have been close to \nimpossible to hold DOD to the commitments it has made to the local \ncommunity. This is because, with respect to chemical demilitarization, \nDOD has long operated in a less than transparent manner. Craig has been \nanother set of eyes and ears for the Kentucky delegation, keeping us \nabreast of what is going on--or not going on--at the depot. In this \nregard, Craig has been at the vanguard of a unique public/private \npartnership between the citizens of Madison County and its elected \nrepresentatives, including my colleague and friend from Kentucky, \nSenator Bunning.\n  But for the efforts of Craig and the CWWG, our Nation's obligations \nunder the Chemical Weapons Convention would be in more jeopardy than \nthey already are. More importantly, but for Craig and the CWWG, \nhundreds of thousands of Americans would continue living indefinitely \nwith the specter of an aging and increasingly unstable chemical weapons \nstockpile looming in their midst.\n  All of us in the Commonwealth of Kentucky owe Craig and the CWWG a \nsubstantial debt of gratitude for their tireless work to protect the \nhealth and safety of the public, the depot workers, and the local \nenvironment.\n  I ask my fellow Senators to join me in paying tribute to the CWWG and \nto my friend, Craig Williams.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9924-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9924-S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, yesterday marked the 4-year anniversary \nof the tragedies that took place on September 11, 2001. Out of the \ndestruction of that terrible day emerged a renewal of the American \nspirit and a rejuvenated commitment to fight the scourge of terrorism \nboth at home and abroad.\n  Yesterday, I was honored to attend a memorial service along with \nGovernor Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, former Pennsylvania Governor and \nHomeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge, Attorney General Alberto \nGonzales, and other public officials to pay tribute to the brave \npassengers and crew aboard flight 93. We now know with near certainty \nthat the terrorists aboard that flight had plans of causing severe \ndestruction to either the White House or the Capitol Building. Thanks \nto the heroic actions of the men and women aboard that flight, \nthousands of lives were spared, and one of the greatest symbols of \nAmerica's freedom and democracy still stands.\n  The individuals who tried to break our fortitude will never succeed. \nThey failed because as Americans we are all living, breathing examples \nof freedom and democracy, of strength and character. No act of \nterrorism can ever take that away from us.\n  I continue to believe that the individuals, States, and countries \nthat have supported terrorism should be brought to justice. On October \n7, 2001, President Bush announced Operation Enduring Freedom to \ndismantle the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which was harboring al-\nQaida. Thanks to the brave men and women in our armed forces and the \nsupport of other nations, we have captured countless members of al-\nQaida.\n  As Americans, we have been blessed with a country that endorses \nfreedom and equality. Sadly, the Afghani people were not as fortunate, \nliving under the oppressive regime of the Taliban. We and other \ndemocratic nations have finally given them the chance to live in a free \nsociety. They have made considerable progress in establishing a \ndemocracy, noted by their landmark election on October 9, 2004, in \nwhich millions of Afghanis came out to vote.\n  The terrorists are relentless; they will continue to target America \nunless we take a firm stand against them. While we have made \nsignificant progress, we must remain vigilant in bringing al-Qaida to \njustice. Winning the war on terror is essential for the safety of \nAmerica and other nations around the world. America has a unique \nopportunity to lead this fight and act as a symbol of freedom for all \npeople. I feel honored to represent the people of Pennsylvania in the \nUnited States Senate, and I hope that we will all continue to work \ntoward creating a safer world for our future generations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this past Sunday, Americans from all \nparts of the country and all walks of life joined together in solemnly \nmarking the painful anniversary of the terrible attacks of September \n11, 2001.\n  Of course, Americans remember 9/11 every day. It has become a part of \nhow we understand the world around us; it has been seared into our \nnational consciousness. But we do not remember only the terrorist \nattacks themselves. We remember the lives, contributions, and \naspirations of nearly three thousand innocent men, women and children \nwho were killed that day. We remember the courage and heroism of our \nfirst responders. And we remember the outpouring of support and \nassistance and solidarity that came from every community in this great \ncountry and from so many around the world in the days following the \nattacks.\n  All of these memories unite us as Americans. Every day, those \nmemories strengthen our unshakable resolve to defeat the terrorist \nnetworks that wish\n\n[[Page S9925]]\n\nto do us harm, and to preserve the freedoms that generations of \nAmericans have fought to protect.\n  As our country confronts the devastation left in the wake of \nhurricane Katrina, we can see some of that same national strength, that \nsame American solidarity and resolve, emerging again. It is by \nnurturing and reinforcing that national strength and compassion that we \npay tribute to those we lost on September 11, 2001.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, on this fourth anniversary of the tragedy \nof September 11, 2001, we pause to remember the victims and families \nimpacted by the horrific terrorist attacks on our Nation. We also honor \nthe bravery and sacrifice of our first responders and the generosity of \nmillions of Americans who united to support one another.\n  The wounds from that dreadful day will never completely heal. \nFamilies and friends of those killed in New York City, the Pentagon, \nand on flight 93 over Pennsylvania still grieve for the senseless loss \nof their loved ones. We will never forget their sacrifices.\n  This year, as we simultaneously recover from the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina and honor those that lost their lives on September \n11, we must continue to bolster our Nation's readiness for disasters of \nall sorts. Congress must fulfill its responsibility to the victims of \nterrorism by supporting the efforts of our military and law enforcement \nas they continue to pursue those who seek to do our Nation harm. \nLikewise, Hurricane Katrina has reestablished what September 11 proved \n4 years ago, that we still have work to do in preparing our Nation to \nrespond to a large scale disaster. The best way to honor the victims of \n9/11 and our most recent disaster is to act to correct the mistakes of \nthe past. We must continue to learn and evolve so that our Government \ncan be as responsive as possible to the security needs of its citizens \nnow, to honor the memory of those we have lost and as a promise to \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9925-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH.

Mr. President, on Friday, September 9th the Nation \nhonored two of our fallen heroes with the unveiling of their names at \nthe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, DC. \nOfficers Michael King and Richard Smith of the Albuquerque Police \nDepartment were killed in the line of duty on August 19, 2005, a day \nthat has become known as ``The Saddest Day'' to the residents of \nAlbuquerque. The officers were in the process of taking into custody a \nmentally unstable man who had allegedly murdered 3 other people. Their \nactions on that fateful day saved the lives of countless others and \nwere exemplary of the way these two fine officers lived their lives.\n  I speak today to honor Officer King and Officer Smith not for the way \nthey died but for the way they lived--examples of honesty, dedication, \ncommitment, and caring to the countless lives that they touched through \ntheir work and in their private lives. The residents of Albuquerque and \nNew Mexico have taken these officers and their families to their heart. \nNow the Nation has the opportunity to honor these fine men.\n  Officer Michael King joined the Albuquerque Police Department in 1980 \nand spend 11 years in the traffic unit until he retired. But King \nmissed the camaraderie of the force and his fellow officers and he \nreturned to work in the traffic unit. Often referred to as a ``gentle \ngiant,'' Michael would often stop to help stranded motorists fix their \ncars. Mr. King worked with and trained many of New Mexico's top law \nenforcement officers and left a lasting impression with them all. \nOfficer King leaves behind a wife and two sons.\n  Like his good friend Officer King, Officer Richard Smith didn't need \nto be working that August day. He had retired from APD but he couldn't \nstay away and returned to service to protect the people of Albuquerque. \nOfficer Smith is remembered as a man who was committed to his family, \nfaith, and public service. He was always ready with a broad smile and a \nwave. He spent most of his career as a traffic cop and was buried 25 \nyears to the day he graduated from the police academy. Officer Smith \nleaves behind a wife and a 13-year-old daughter.\n  These two officers are examples of the best our Nation has to offer. \nIt is right that we honor these men and all the officers who have given \ntheir lives to protect their fellow citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9925-3", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9925-S9926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, by raising awareness one moment at a \ntime, we can minimize the harm that drinking during pregnancy causes \nour most vulnerable population--our children.\n  In February of 1999, a small group of parents, raising children \nafflicted with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, set out to change the \nworld. That small group started an ``online support group'' which \nquickly became a worldwide grassroots movement to observe September 9 \nas International Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders Awareness Day. Former \nSenate Minority Leader Tom Daschle was instrumental in having the \nSenate take notice of this important issue.\n  This year for the seventh consecutive year, communities across the \nNation are pausing at the hour of 9:09 a.m. to acknowledge this day.\n  Events are occurring in cities and towns not just across the country, \nbut around the world--from Chilliwack, British Columbia to Cape Town, \nSouth Africa to Madagascar--families are joining together today to \nraise awareness of fetal alcohol syndrome disorders or FASD.\n  My State of Alaska will observe this day with solemn events in \nAnchorage, Juneau, Kenai, and Fairbanks.\n  FASD is an umbrella term that describes a range of physical and \nmental birth defects that can occur in a fetus when a pregnant woman \ndrinks alcohol. It is a leading cause of nonhereditary mental \nretardation in the U.S. Many children affected by maternal drinking \nduring pregnancy have irreversible conditions--including severe brain \ndamage--that cause permanent, lifelong disability.\n  FASD is 100 percent preventable. Prevention merely requires a woman \nto abstain from alcohol during pregnancy.\n  Yet every year in America, an estimated one in every 100 babies born \nare born with FASD--that's 40,000 infants. FASD affects more children \nthan Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida and muscular dystrophy \ncombined.\n  The cost of FASD is high--more than $3 billion each year in direct \nhealth care costs, and many times that amount in lost human potential. \nLifetime health costs for an individual living with FASD averages \n$860,000.\n  The indirect financial and social costs to the Nation are even \ngreater--including the cost of incarceration, specialized health care, \neducation, foster care, job training and general support services.\n  All in all, the direct and indirect economic costs of FASD in the \nU.S. are estimated to be $5.4 billion.\n  You can find FASD in every community in America--native, non-native, \nrich, poor--it doesn't discriminate. That is why, last February, the \nU.S. Surgeon General Richard Carmona\n\n[[Page S9926]]\n\nagain issued another advisory to pregnant women, or women who plan to \nbecome pregnant, to completely abstain from all alcohol use.\n  In Alaska, I am troubled to report that we have the highest rate of \nFASD in the Nation. Approximately 163 Alaskan babies are born each year \naffected by maternal alcohol use during pregnancy. Among our native \ncommunities, the rate of FASD is 15 times higher than non-Native areas \nin the state.\n  And again, FASD is 100 percent preventable. We can save so many \nchildren and families so much heartache simply by increasing people's \nawareness of what FASD is and how we can prevent it. In fact, \nprevention of FASD is seven times more cost effective than treating the \ndisorder.\n  That is why Senator Tim Johnson and I--and several others from both \nsides of the aisle--will soon be introducing legislation to direct more \nresources toward this terrible problem. The ``Advancing FASD Research, \nPrevention, and Services Act'' will--develop and implement targeted \nstate and community-based outreach programs; improve coordination among \nFederal agencies involved in FASD treatment and research by \nestablishing stronger communication with these programs, and improve \nsupport services for families and strengthen educational outreach \nefforts to doctors, teachers, judges and others whose work puts them in \ncontact with people with FASD.\n  Forty-thousand American children a year are born with FASD. Our \ninvestment today in prevention, treatment and research will save \ncountless in future health costs of this devastating but completely \npreventable disorder.

Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nrecognize some of the most brilliant and hardest working young adults \nin our Nation and in the world today. These seventeen outstanding \nscholars have recently been named 2005 Davidson Fellows and are being \nrewarded for their cutting-edge and distinguished work. The Davidson \nInstitute Fellowships promote and reward under-18 year olds who have \nundertaken invaluable projects and studies for the greater good of our \ncountry and the world. The Davidson Institute awards scholarships to \neach of the Fellows to assist them in furthering their education. I \ndon't believe the Davidson Institute could have found a more \ndistinguished or more deserving group of young scholars. I would like \nto detail their accomplishments for a moment.\n  Karsten Gimre was just 11 years old when he became a Davidson Fellow \nbased on his project entitled ``Conversation Without Words.'' This \nyoung pianist from Banks, Oregon has performed with several \nprofessional orchestras and has been winning awards for his exceptional \nabilities since the age of 6 when he earned first place at the \nInternational Young Artists Concert here in Washington, D.C. At the age \nof 12 he is now studying math and physics at the Pacific University \nwhile continuing his musical instruction.\n  As a young writer from Canton, MI, Heidi Kaloustian's unique talent \nand creative genius allowed her to explore complex relationships and \npersonal identity in her portfolio entitled ``The Roots of All Things'' \nwhile still allowing the reader to emotionally connect with the work \nand characters. Heidi plans to continue creative writing at the \nUniversity of Michigan-Ann Arbor and I have no doubt that she will be \nvery successful as a professor and as a writer.\n  Tiffany Ko, a 16 year old from Terre Haute, IN, put herself on the \ncutting edge of technology and science when she used electric field \nsensing to design a new type of computerized security system. Her \nproject is a significant advancement from current security systems and \ncould be used to make people and businesses safer than ever before.\n  At the age of 17 years old, Milana Zaurova from Fresh Meadows, NY has \nbegun developing a new way to treat the most deadly form of brain \ncancer, malignant glioma. She combined chemotherapy and gene-therapy to \ndevelop a creative new method that has the potential to save many \nlives.\n  As a 12-year old from Chapel Hill, NC, Maia Cabeza has already \ndeveloped an extensive resume as a violinist. She has earned praise in \nthe United States and abroad for her technical proficiency and \nmusicality. Maia has the noble goal of using her music to breach \ncultural and language barriers, and I wish her the best of luck and \nsuccess.\n  When Brett Harrison was just 16 years old he was able to develop a \nmathematical proof that actually improved upon a conjecture developed \nby a Princeton University professor. This Dix Hills, NY native's work \nis applicable to numerous fields such as communications, structural \ndesign, and computer networking systems.\n  Tudor Dominik Maican is a gifted and talented 16-year-old composer \nfrom Bethesda, MD. He has already been commissioned by the Dumbarton \nMusical Society for a piano solo and has been the recipient of numerous \nawards for his imaginative and wide-ranging compositions.\n  Justin Solomon, from Oakton, VA, designed an algorithm to recognize \nan object based on its three dimensional features. Most recognition \nprograms only use two dimensions, so Justin's new algorithm increases a \nprogram's accuracy and can potentially be used in the fields of \nsecurity, robotics, and artificial intelligence.\n  John Zhou of Northville, MI took an interest in biomedicine because \nof its scientific and humanitarian aspects, and has now studied the DNA \nreplication process with the goal of understanding and ultimately \nhalting mutations and cancer development. John is also accomplished in \nmany other fields including mathematics, physics, and Spanish.\n  Kadir Annamalai's project focused around building nanowires, or wires \nonly about two molecules thick that could be used in devices like power \ngenerators and circuit boards. In addition to this extremely technical \nwork, Kadir, who is from Saratoga, CA, is also an Eagle Scout and is \nthe recipient of numerous Future Business Leaders of America awards.\n  Motivated by a strong desire to help those affected with Alzheimer's \ndisease, Stephanie Hon, from Fort Myers, FL, investigated a creative \nmethod that her study suggests could possibly reverse some of the \neffects of Alzheimer's. Stephanie is considering continuing her \nAlzheimer's research at Harvard University this fall and we all wish \nher continued success.\n  Benedict Shan Yuan Huang's project, Changed Particle Production in \nHigh Energy Nuclear Collisions, is as technical and advanced as it \nsounds. He has created a new technique that promises to achieve quicker \nand more accurate results when studying the structure of matter. \nBenedict, who is from Coram, NY, will attend Harvard University in the \nfall and will most likely study science as well as the piano.\n  At the age of 16 Lucas Moller from Moscow, ID has already worked with \nNASA, the European Space Agency, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His \nstudy on Martian dust and its effect on Martian lander missions has \nbeen incorporated on the Mars Surveyor lander and the Mars Express/\nBeagle 2 mission.\n  Nimish Ramanlal from Winter Springs, FL was able to advance the field \nof quantum computing by creating a new framework for quantum computing \nthat overcomes the limitations on the effectiveness of quantum \ncomputers. His work could help a new form of computing to emerge with \nprofound implications in nanotechnology, medical research, and advanced \nphysics.\n  With the internet growing every day, Tony Wu of Irvine, CA created a \nnew internet search method that could be highly useful in the \ninformation society of the 21st century. He has competed successfully \nin numerous science competitions and plans to study computer science or \nelectronics engineering in college.\n  Fan Yang, a 17-year-old young woman from Davis, CA, developed a \nmethod of preventing eye infections by\n\n[[Page S9927]]\n\nusing three compounds that prevent bacteria from forming and growing on \nthe contact or intraocular lenses. This is a promising line of research \nthat demonstrates the combination of Fan Yang's love of science and \ndesire to help people.\n  At the age of 6 years old, Marc Yu, who is from Monterey Park, CA, \nhas already won numerous awards and competitions for both his piano and \ncello performances including both first place for the cello and second \nplace for the piano at the Southwest Youth Music Festival.\n  Mr. President, despite their relatively young age, these seventeen \noutstanding young men and women have all achieved remarkable things and \nfully deserve the awards that they have earned. Their past is \novershadowed, however, by their even brighter futures and careers made \neasier by becoming 2005 Davidson Fellows. I would like to thank these \nyoung scientists, mathematicians, writers, and musicians for their \naccomplishments, past, present, and future, that will no doubt improve \nthe lives of a great many people in this country and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9927-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL SCHOOL BACKPACK AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, on September 21, 2005, the American \nOccupational Therapy Association and more than 700 occupational therapy \npractitioners nationwide and around the world will be celebrating \nNational School Backpack Awareness Day. They will be working with over \n150,000 children to teach them how to prevent backpack-related injuries \nand to remain healthy and successful in school. In my home State of \nMaine, occupational therapists have arranged events in 15 schools and \nwill be reaching over 5,000 students.\n  According to a number of studies done both internationally and in the \nUnited States, children using overloaded and improperly worn backpacks \nexperience neck, should, and back pain and have problems with breathing \nand fatigue at significantly higher rates than students wearing \nbackpacks properly and with appropriate loads. No child should \nregularly carry more than 15 percent of their body weight on their \nback. At Backpack Awareness Day events, which will be held in schools, \nstores, hospitals, shopping malls, and a variety of other venues, \noccupational therapy practitioners will ``weigh-in'' children and their \nbackpacks to make sure that the backpacks do not surpass 15 percent of \nthe child's body weight. The therapists will provide guidance about how \nto properly load and carry a backpack will also share tips about how to \nstay healthy and succeed in school. In Maine, these weigh-ins are being \nconducted in local schools from Saco to Skowhegan, and also in \ncommunities like Farmington, where Franklin Memorial Hospital is \nsponsoring a weigh-in as part of their Youth Health Fest.\n  Occupational therapy practitioners work with individuals across the \nlifespan. In schools occupational therapists work to modify educational \nenvironments to ensure that all students can achieve academic success. \nOccupational therapists provide assistance to teachers and school \nadministrators in order to make school environments more accessible and \nconducive to learning. They also consult with educators to improve \nstudents' academic functioning and work to help prevent learning, \nmental, and physical disabilities from getting in the way of academic \nsuccess. Occupational therapy practitioners in schools work directly \nwith students, parents, and teachers to develop plans to improve \nstudents' function and productivity and to foster success and maximize \ntheir independence within the academic environment.\n  National School Backpack Awareness Day is a good example of how \noccupational therapists work within our schools and communities to \npromote wellness, and I am pleased to have this opportunity to \nacknowledge their valuable contributions. I urge all of my colleagues \nto join me in supporting September 21, 2005, as National School \nBackpack Awareness Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9927-2", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9927-S9928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO HOMER A. MAXEY, JR.\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on the occasion of the 33rd annual \nconvention of the National Association of Foreign-Trade Zones, NAFTZ, \nwhich is meeting this week in my home State of Hawaii, I rise today to \npay tribute to the cofounder of the NAFTZ, my good friend, Homer A. \nMaxey, Jr., who I have known for more than a quarter century.\n  The NAFTZ was conceived in November of 1972, at an informal meeting \nof foreign-trade zone representatives from various States. At that \nmeeting, Homer A. Maxey, Jr., was selected chairman of a committee to \ndevelop the organizational framework for a formal association \nrepresenting FTZ grantees and operators in the U.S. During a conference \nof FTZ managers in Washington, DC, on May 8, 1973, the NAFTZ was \nofficially launched and Homer was elected to serve as the first \nPresident of this Association from 1973 to 1975. Homer was elected, by \nunanimous vote of the members, as the first Honorary Life Member at the \nNAFTZ Annual Conference in 1979. He has served on many different \nCommittees of the NAFTZ including: the Oil Refinery Sub-Zone Task \nForce, ORSTF, the Operations Committee, Nominations Committee, the Long \nRange Planning Committee, and several task forces. Today the NAFTZ \nrepresents over 800 members comprised of State and local government \nagencies, public entities, individuals and corporations involved in the \nForeign-Trade Zone program. The NAFTZ plays an important role in \nfacilitating international trade and U.S. competitiveness through the \npromotion and support of the Foreign-Trade Zones Program.\n  The Foreign-Trade Zones Program was created by an act of Congress in \n1934. Its purpose is to encourage domestic warehousing, manufacturing \nand processing activity. States and local governments use foreign-trade \nzones as part of their overall economic development strategy and to \nimprove the international business sector in their communities. FTZs \ncontribute to the enhancement of the U.S. investment climate for \ncommerce and industry. The FTZ program encourages capital investment in \nthe U.S. rather than abroad and secures American jobs. The benefit \noccurs only if the activity takes place in the U.S. It substitutes \nU.S.-produced merchandise and labor for foreign imports. Today there \nare 260 approved general-purpose zones and 534 subzones located in all \n50 States and Puerto Rico. According to the latest available annual \nreport of the Foreign-Trade Zones Board, the total value of merchandise \nreceived at foreign-trade zones annually exceeds $200 billion. Over \n2,200 firms in the U.S. utilize foreign-trade zones and employment at \nthese facilities exceeds 300,000.\n  During his involvement with the NAFTZ, Homer Maxey has played an \ninstrumental role in the growth and development of the U.S. Foreign-\nTrade Zones Program. For instance, he was instrumental in a number of \nissues, challenges, and accomplishments of the program, including \nspearheading customs regulations to limit customs duties on merchandise \nmanufactured in FTZs to foreign material only; streamlining FTZ \ninventory recordkeeping; creating uniform FTZ management practices \nnationally; securing weekly entry for manufacturing; eliminating \nactivation and annual fees on foreign-trade zones; allowing users of \nforeign-trade zones to defer entry and payment of duty on foreign \nproduction machinery used in FTZs until such time that the equipment \ngoes into commercial production, and eliminating the merchandise \nprocessing fee on domestic materials shipped from FTZs.\n  At the same time Homer Maxey directed General Purpose Foreign-Trade \nZone No. 9 in Hawaii, which was established in February 1965. Homer was \nthe Administrator for the State of Hawaii's Foreign-Trade Zone project \nfrom 1965 through 1993. During his management of the zone, the first \nFTZ oil refinery was established on Oahu. Thereafter, the program in \nHawaii grew under his direction to include today five General-Purpose \nZone sites and five Subzones handling $2.04 billion worth of \nmerchandise from 341 firms, with exports of $290,980,773 and employing \na total of 2,683 people in zone-related activities. From its modest \nbeginnings with 40,000 square feet originally approved, the General \nPurpose Zone project grew to involve 15 percent of the designated \nindustrial lands on the Island of Oahu.\n\n[[Page S9928]]\n\n  After attending the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, Mr. Maxey was \nemployed by Hawaiian Airlines. He served in the U.S. Air Force during \nthe early 1950s. He was employed by Matson Lines, 1955-1965, in \npassenger sales, freight traffic and marine operations. He has also \nbeen active in the Hawaii/Pacific Export Council, the Propeller Club of \nthe Port of Honolulu, and the Chamber of Commerce of Hawaii. Mr. Maxey \nhas also been a consultant to the State of Hawaii, the County of \nHawaii, and Foreign-Trade Zone No. 9.\n  It is my honor to recognize the lifelong contributions of Homer Maxey \nto the U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones Program and the State of Hawaii. I wish \nHomer and his wife, Mahina, all the best in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9928-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9928]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       S. 1681.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to strengthen courts for at-risk children, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my \ncolleague, Senator Rockefeller, which would impact the lives of many \nat-risk children living in foster care. This bill is called WE CARE \nKids: Working to Enhance Courts for At-risk and Endangered Kids Act of \n2005.\n  How well a child welfare system functions is often related to how \nwell the accompanying court system functions. The important role of the \ncourts was noted last year when the Pew Commission on Children in \nFoster Care released their recommendations to overhaul the Nation's \nfoster care system. As observed by the Pew Commission, it is the courts \nthat decide whether a child has been abused or neglected and whether \nthat child should be placed in the foster care system. It is the courts \nthat oversee whether the parents are making progress on their case plan \nand enforce the timelines for permanency. It is the courts that decide \nwhether a parent's rights should be terminated or whether a family \nshould be reunified. These judges are making tough, life-changing \ndecisions for all parties involved.\n  To strengthen the courts making these life-altering decisions, the \nPew Commission recommended: 1. The adoption of court performance \nmeasures by every dependency court; 2. incentives and requirements for \neffect collaboration between courts and child welfare agencies; 3. a \nstrong voice in court for parents and children, as well as effective \nand well-trained representation by attorneys and volunteer advocates; \nand 4. leadership from chief justices and other State court leaders to \norganize their systems to better serve the needs of children, train \njudges, and promote effective standards for courts, judges and \nattorneys.\n  The legislation that Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing today \nincorporates many of the recommendations of the Pew Commission. Among \nother provisions, the legislation provides $10 million for grants for \ntraining of judges and court personnel, of which a significant portion \nmust be used for joint training between courts and child welfare \nagencies. It also provides $10 million for grants to the highest State \ncourt for the development and implementation of outcome measures \nrelated to safety, permanency, due process, and timeliness of court \nproceedings. The bill requires States to\n\n[[Page S9933]]\n\ndevelop standards of practice for attorneys appearing in child abuse \nand neglect proceedings, as well as provides loan forgiveness for \nattorneys who practice in family, domestic, and juvenile courts and for \nsocial workers who work within the child welfare system. The bill \nincreases funding for the expansion of the Court Appointed Special \nAdvocate program, and it includes a provision that would ease the \nplacement of children in foster care from one State to another, for the \npurposes of speeding adoptions out of the foster care system.\n  Let me conclude by saying that when Congress passed the Adoption and \nSafe Families Act, I believed it was a good start. Congress, however, \nwould have to do more to make sure that every child has the opportunity \nto live in a safe, stable, loving and permanent home. One of the \nessential ingredients is an efficiently operating court system--a \nsystem that puts the principles embodied in the law into practice. Our \nbill would help the court system do just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mike DeWine in introducing new legislation to \npromote better cooperation and collaboration between the courts and \nState agencies serving abused and neglected children. Our bill also \nseeks to improve the process for children to be adopted between two \nStates, and gain a safe, permanent home that is one of the priorities \nestablished in the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families Act. Our bill is \nnamed Working to Enhance Courts for At-Risk and Endangered Kids Act of \n2005, WE CARE, Kids.\n  Senator DeWine and I have worked for years in bipartisan coalition to \nimprove services and policies for our most vulnerable children, nearly \n500,000 children who are in the foster care system. These children \ndeserve our attention and our compassion. Through no fault of their \nown, such children are placed in foster care for their safety. They \nneed to be safe, but they also need prompt and good decisions made for \ntheir long-term future and stability. Whenever possible, we should \ninvest to help restore the family and reunite the children with their \nfamilies if we know that they will be safe. In some cases, legal \nguardianship or adoption are the best options for the child. It is \nessential to make good decisions in a timely manner for such children. \nThe social services agencies and the courts truly must work together on \nsuch cases.\n  Recently the bipartisan Pew Commission on Children in Foster Care \nissued a thoughtful report with recommendations on how to strengthen \nthe courts serving children in foster care. The Commission was led by \nformer Congressman Bill Frenzel and co-chaired by former Congressman \nBill Gray. It includes a wide range of leaders and experts. The \ncommission did a careful review of the role of the courts in serving \nchildren in foster care, and it issued a series of recommendations. We \nare grateful for this report and relied on many of their \nrecommendations in crafting this legislation. As always, we hope to \nforge bipartisan consensus on ways to move this bill forward.\n  The legislation also includes a provision to promote inter-state \nadoptions. With modern technology, caring families from one State may \nlearn of a child in a foster care system in another State who is \nseeking adoption. When this happens, we need to be careful and thorough \nin accessing information to ensure the right placement. But we also \nmust be sure that bureaucratic paperwork does not unnecessarily delay \nan adoption.\n  In West Virginia, there are about 80 children in our State foster \ncare system ready for adoption; nationwide 118,000 children are in \nfoster care and waiting for a safe permanent home. The wake of \nHurricane Katrina and the Meth Epidemic in regions of our country, \ntragically could make these numbers increase. We must improve our \nsystem to do the best we can for these vulnerable children. Passing the \nWE CARE, Kids Act could be an important step forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN:\n  S. 1680.

After all, we \nknow all too well that al Qaeda is a stealthy, sophisticated, and \npatient enemy, and that its leadership is extremely motivated to launch \nanother devastating attack on American citizens and American soil.\n  In fact, outside the United States, al Qaeda and affiliates of al \nQaeda have continued to be remarkably active, responsible for numerous \nterrorist attacks over the last few years, spanning the globe from \nPakistan to Bali to Spain to London.\n  It is precisely because al Qaeda is so aggressive, so motivated, and \nso demonstrably hostile to America that I am so grateful that, to date, \nal Qaeda still has not successfully launched another terrorist attack \non our soil. There are undoubtedly many reasons for this. First and \nforemost, I am profoundly thankful to the brave men and women of our \nArmed Forces, who fight the terrorists abroad so that we do not have to \nface them at home. I also firmly believe that our efforts to strengthen \nanti-terrorism and law enforcement tools right here at home have much \nto do with this record of success and peace in our homeland to date.\n  The war on terrorism must be fought aggressively--but consistent with \nthe protection of civil rights and civil liberties. Whenever real civil \nliberties problems do arise, we must learn about them right away, so \nthat we can fix them swiftly.\n  Last year, Federal judge struck down a portion of the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act of 1986. This law balanced the national \ninterest in protecting electronic communications privacy against the \nlegitimate needs of national security, by establishing a procedure for \nobtaining electronic communications records in certain national \nsecurity investigations through the use of so-called ``national \nsecurity letters.'' The USA PATRIOT Act amended the law to make clear \nthat such letters could be issued in terrorism investigations as well.\n  This provision was passed by the Senate on a voice vote, and shortly \nthereafter it passed the House by unanimous consent.\n  The primary reason the court struck down this provision was that the \nright to judicial review was not expressly written into the text of the \nlaw. It is important to note that the ability to scrutinize the \nissuance of national security letters was not actually disputed by the \ngovernment. To the contrary, the Justice Department agreed that there \nshould be judicial review. The court simply concluded that the 1986 law \nwas not drafted with sufficient clarity to authorize such review.\n  I have previously introduced legislation to remedy the defects noted \nby the District Judge. That legislation amended the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act to make explicit the\n\n[[Page S9940]]\n\navailability of judicial review to examine national security letters. \nHowever, national security letters are also available outside the Title \n18 context. For instance, Title 15 allows the government to obtain \nconsumer information maintained by consumer reporting agencies; Title \n12 allows the government to obtain the financial records maintained by \nfinancial institutions; and Title 50 allows the government to obtain \nrecords about persons with access to classified information who may \nhave disclosed classified information to a foreign power.\n  It is important to make sure that the right to judicial review is \nstatutorily available in all national security letter contexts. The \nbill I am introducing today expressly authorizes a recipient to \nchallenge any national security letter in court. It also: details the \nprocedure the government must follow to substantiate its use of a \nnational security letter; allows the government to present classified \ninformation to the court so that it can properly evaluate the \nchallenge; and specifies that a recipient of a national security letter \nmay consult with legal counsel about its obligations.\n  I hope that this legislation will be enacted in the same bipartisan \nspirit that put both the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and the \nUSA PATRIOT Act on the books.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. OBAMA (for himself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Corzine, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, \n        and Mr. Salazar):\n  S. 1685. A bill to ensure the evacuation of individuals with special \nneeds in times of emergency; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. OBAMA. Mr. President, one of the most striking things about the \ndevastation caused by Hurricane Katrina is that the majority of \nstranded victims were our society's most vulnerable members--low-income \nfamilies, the elderly, the homeless, the disabled. Many did not own \ncars. Many believed themselves unable to flee the city, unable to \nforego the income from missed work, unable to incur the expenses of \ntravel, food and lodging. Some may have misunderstood the severity of \nthe warnings, if they heard the warnings at all. Some may have needed \nhelp that was unavailable. Whatever the reason, they were not evacuated \nand we have seen the horrific results.\n  This failure to evacuate so many of the most desperate citizens of \nthe Gulf Coast leads me to introduce today a bill to require states and \nthe nation to consider the needs of our neediest citizens in times of \nemergency.\n  It appears that certain assumptions were made in planning and \npreparing for the worst case scenario in the Gulf Coast. After all, \nmost of those who could afford to evacuate managed to do so. They drove \nout of town and checked into hotels or stayed with friends and family. \nBut what about the thousands of people left behind because they had \nspecial needs?\n  How many of us will forget the tragedy that occurred at St. Rita's \nNursing Home in St. Bernard Parish, LA, where an estimated 32 of the 60 \nresidents perished in the rising floodwaters in the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina?\n  Our charge as public servants is to worry about all of the people. I \nam troubled that our emergency response and disaster plans were \ninadequate for large segments of the Gulf Coast population. I wonder \nwhether the plans in other regions are adequate. Perfect evacuation \nplanning is obviously impractical, but greater advance preparation can \nensure that the most vulnerable are not simply forgotten or ignored.\n  That's why the bill I am introducing today, along with co-sponsors \nSenators Bayh, Murray, Harkin, Levin, Corzine, Feingold, Bingaman and \nKennedy, requires the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security \nto mandate each State to include plans for the evacuation of \nindividuals with special needs during times of emergency. Such plans \nshould not only include an explanation of how these people--low income \nindividuals and families, the elderly, the disabled, those who cannot \nspeak English--will be evacuated out of the emergency area and how the \nstates will provide shelter, food, and water, to these people once \nevacuated.\n  Communities with special needs may be more challenging to \naccommodate, but they are every bit as important to protect and serve \nin the event of an emergency.\n  What we saw in the Gulf Coast cannot be repeated. We may not be able \nto control the wrath of Mother Nature, but we can control how we \nprepare for natural disasters.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/09/12/senate-section/article/S9940-1", "month": "09", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1687.
