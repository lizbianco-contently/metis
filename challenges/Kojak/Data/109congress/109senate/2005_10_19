Mr. President, this morning we will start with a 60-minute \nperiod for morning business. Following that time, at approximately \n10:45 or so, we will return to the pending business, which is the \nTransportation-Treasury-HUD appropriations bill. We expect to have two \nvotes in relation to the minimum wage issue today. I hope we can \nschedule those votes early.\n  We need to make substantial progress on the underlying bill today, \nand I hope we can get back to amendments pertaining to matters within \nthe scope of the bill. The two managers have been on the floor since \nMonday, and I know they are prepared to bring this bill to a close as \nsoon as possible. I would reiterate again that we will finish this bill \nthis week, with votes on Friday if necessary.\n  In addition to the Transportation-Treasury appropriations bill, we \ncontinue to move forward with resolve to meet our overall governing \nresponsibilities. Given the significant, unexpected expenditures for \nKatrina, the Senate will meet the challenge of making tough choices \nabout spending priorities. Most of my days, and the days of my \nleadership colleagues, have been spent in helping pull people together, \nin making those tough choices which are focused on restraining \nGovernment spending.\n  That does start at home in this body. Thus, yesterday the Senate \noverwhelmingly voted to eliminate congressional pay raises. I believe \nthat was an appropriate action. It shows we are serious as we look for \nsavings throughout the Government, and it starts at home in this body.\n  Eight committees of the Senate are hard at work doing the exact same \nthing, and that is prioritizing. I thank and commend the committees and \ntheir chairs and ranking members--the HELP Committee, the Banking \nCommittee, the Environment and Public Works Committee--for their \nsuccess yesterday in meeting those goals set out in the budget. I thank \nthe chairmen and the committee members for their tremendous progress to \ndate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11503-8", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11503-S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SADDAM HUSSEIN TRIAL\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today begins what is no less than the trial \nof the century, the trial of Saddam Hussein.\n  For the first time in recent history, a former leader will stand \nbefore his own people to be judged and tried for his crimes against \nhumanity. For the first time, the Iraqi people will hear and watch the \n``Butcher of Baghdad'' answer for 23 years of terror.\n  Saddam's crimes are surpassed only by the Rwandan genocide, Pol Pot's \nkilling fields, and the tyrannies of Hitler, Mao, Stalin, and Kim Jong \nIl.\n  Egyptians, Kuwaitis, and Iranians were put to death simply because he \ndecreed so. Saddam killed Kurds because of their ethnicity. And he \nkilled Shiites because of their religion, Sunnis for their political \nviews. Even babies and toddlers fell victim to the firing squad.\n  As Prime Minister al-Jafari said yesterday, there will be no tears \nfor Saddam Hussein. But most surely, there will be tears for the \nhundreds of thousands of lives he crushed and destroyed with utter \nruthlessness.\n  The trial of Saddam will reveal to the Iraqis and to the world the \nfull extent of his brutality. And as the crimes are tallied and \nrecorded, he will face the full judgment of the people and the \nuncompromising judgment of history.\n  I am confident justice will be served and that Saddam and his \nhenchmen will be treated fairly and appropriately. And I am hopeful the \nprocess\n\n[[Page S11504]]\n\nwill be an opportunity for the Iraqi people to experience some measure \nof catharsis and closure on a dark and terrible chapter in their \nhistory.\n  I commend them for their courage to restrain the desire for vengeance \nand to commit to the rule of law. It cannot be easy. Saddam's abuse ran \ndeep and ran wide. But by granting him a fair trial--an opportunity to \nanswer the charges--the Iraqi people are showing that Saddam's \nbrutality was born of his nature and not theirs.\n\n  Cicero once said:\n\n       Let us remember that justice must be observed even to the \n     lowest.\n\n  Today, let it be said that justice will be observed even by the once \nmighty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11504-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is \ntestifying today at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. She will be \nmeeting with the full Senate later for a classified briefing.\n  I am sure one of the topics that will be discussed at length will be \nthe Iraqi constitutional referendum of this last Saturday. That vote \nwas an important milestone. The voting by so many Iraqis was again a \ndemonstrable act of courage. It is my most sincere hope that in the \nmonths to come, the political process in Iraq moves forward, that a \nstable government takes control in Iraq, and that Iraq takes control of \nits own future.\n  But similar to many of my colleagues, and a growing majority of \nAmericans, we will not be satisfied with the status quo or the stay-\nthe-course answers that we hear over and over from the White House when \nit comes to the situation in Iraq. The most fundamental questions we \nhave to ask of this President and this administration are, What is your \nplan for victory? What is your plan for success? What is your plan to \nbring American troops home from Iraq?\n  It now seems evident that the constitution will pass. It also seems \nevident that despite substantial opposition from the Sunni minority, no \nprovince will reject this constitution or, if any do, there will not be \nenough to, in fact, reject the whole document.\n  Sunnis make up 20 percent of the population but 90 percent of the \ninsurgency in Iraq. Sectarian violence is claiming the lives of \nthousands of Iraqis. We can't even calculate how many. Some are fearful \nthat this country could still fall apart.\n  Saturday's election is no guarantee of long-term democracy in Iraq, \nbut it was an important step forward and one that I applaud. The \ngovernment that may now emerge needs to build legitimacy in Iraq and \nwith its neighbors. It needs to take back control of its country from \ninsurgency, chaos, and lawlessness so that American troops can come \nhome.\n  Iraq cannot succeed if the Sunnis--one in five of the Iraqis--feel \ndisenfranchised and alienated. It is a challenge to their leaders to \nput together a government now that truly reflects their country, to \nbuild not just a coalition of tribes but a nation. This must happen \nbecause the cost of destroying and now replacing the governing regime \nin Iraq has been so costly.\n  Saturday was a good day in Iraq, for sure. But the elections last \nJanuary 30 also represented a good day for Iraq, and 543 Americans have \nlost their lives in Iraq since that election last January. Mr. \nPresident, 15,063 American service men and women have been wounded in \nIraq, and 1,979 Americans have been killed. We are closing in on that \nawesome figure of 2,000 of our best and bravest soldiers having given \ntheir lives in Iraq.\n  Iraq passed an important milestone Saturday with the constitutional \nreferendum. The process was a refreshing demonstration of democracy at \nwork in a region unaccustomed to such a display of civic participation. \nBut the product, some have argued, is flawed. Nonetheless, Iraqis, with \ntheir vote, have taken a step in this political process forward. This \nopportunity for Iraq has come at a high cost for America.\n  As the number of Americans killed continues to grow, and the number \nof injured increases as well, do we have a clear plan in place? At what \nmoment in time will the Iraqi Army battalions be prepared to step \nforward so that Americans can step back? At what point in time will the \nIraqi police force, the Iraqi security forces, say, ``We can now \ncontrol our own country and now Americans can go home''?\n  This administration gives us the vaguest notion that it is somehow \nwrong to think about when that date may come. Perhaps it is wrong to \nannounce it but not to have a plan to reach it. It is something that \nconcerns me.\n  A few weeks ago, Generals Casey and Abizaid told a meeting in \nCongress that only one battalion was prepared to stand and fight by \nitself in Iraq today--only one battalion of the Iraqi Army. It is a far \ncry from 150,000-plus American soldiers who stand and fight today, who \nrisk their lives today.\n  Today, the trial of Saddam Hussein is beginning. We were greeted this \nmorning with all the major news organizations showing the closed-\ncircuit videotape and film of the trial. It is a good thing that he is \nstanding trial because he is a vicious murderer, a thug, and a monster \nof a human being.\n  However, Americans are questioning, still, whether or not we have \npaid too heavy a price for this day to have arrived and asking of this \nadministration, now that he is standing trial: How much longer will we \nbe standing trial in Iraq as we wait for the outcome each day of the \nbloody fighting?\n  What has changed since May of 2003 is that the costs of the war have \nrisen, are still climbing; the trust the American people have placed in \nthe President has been shaken. What has also changed is, while the cost \nof war continues to grow, the alleged justifications for the war have \nmultiplied, and the clarity of our purpose has diminished dramatically. \nThis is a terrible and tragic combination.\n  Saddam was a monster. That is true. But we must never forget that of \nall the many reasons given to us by this administration to invade Iraq, \nthe evil nature of Saddam was the only one that has proven true. Except \nfor the brutality of Saddam Hussein--as bad as it was, as horrible as \nit was--all the other reasons for going to war the administration put \nforth turned out not to be accurate. There were no weapons of mass \ndestruction. We still, many years later, have found no evidence of that \nclaim, made over and over and over again at the highest levels of this \nadministration.\n  The 9/11 Commission showed us there was no support for al-Qaida in \nIraq. Yet as recently as last Sunday, Secretary of State Condoleezza \nRice tried to again link al-Qaida and 9/11 with Saddam Hussein.\n  The 9/11 Commission made it clear, there is no linkage. The war has \nnot increased our own security. Some can argue--and I think \nconvincingly--that it has made the world a more dangerous place. It has \ncreated a training ground for terrorism in Iraq where insurgents come \nfrom surrounding countries to train themselves in killing American \nsoldiers, to go out and do even worse to Americans and others all \naround the world.\n  The only reason left for this war was the removal of Saddam Hussein. \nTwo-thirds of Americans, when they measure that benefit against the \nenormous cost in blood and treasure, conclude it may not have been \nworth that price. Nearly $200 billion has been spent, nearly 2,000 \nAmericans have been killed, and the pricetag goes up every day in terms \nof American lives and American treasure.\n  Our national interest has suffered in other ways as well. The war has \naltered the international strategic environment to our disadvantage. \nLet's begin with Iran. Iran gives every sign that it is determined to \nacquire nuclear weapons. Such a development threatens regional \nstability and our own national security. It is not in our interest or \nthe world's interest. In August, the Bush administration went to the \ndiplomats of more than a dozen countries and presented an hour-long \nslide show on Iran's nuclear program. This PowerPoint briefing \nincorporated satellite imagery and other data to try to convince other \nnations that Iran's nuclear program is aimed at producing\n\n[[Page S11505]]\n\nweapons, not energy. But who could look at such a slide show and not \nthink back to February 2003, when Secretary of State Colin Powell made \na similar case to the United Nations about the existence of weapons of \nmass destruction in Iraq? An embarrassing moment. That was, in my \nopinion, the low point in a very distinguished and noble public career \nof national service of Secretary of State Colin Powell. Indeed, it was \nthe stature of Secretary Powell alone that lent such force to that \nargument. To learn later that the facts were not there had to be a \ncrushing blow to this man who has given so much to America.\n  Two years later we found no weapons of mass destruction. Mohamed \nElBaradei and the International Atomic Energy Agency told us there were \nno weapons of mass destruction. We ignored them. They asked for more \ntime to prove their point; we rejected it. The Bush administration \ndecided we had to invade. We couldn't wait for allies. We couldn't wait \nfor proof. We couldn't wait. Now ElBaradei and the IAEA have been \nproven right and recently were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n  The damage to our national credibility by presenting a distorted case \nfor the war has been severe. Our ability to persuade the international \ncommunity is now diminished. So is our ability to draw in allies to \njoin us in this effort. And the beneficiaries of our policies sadly \nhave been many rogue nations. Like the boy who cried wolf, America now \nmust overcome the damage done to our credibility by false claims that \nwe laid before the world as the justification for the invasion of Iraq. \nAt the same time, the dangers of terrorism to our Nation, our \npersonnel, and citizens abroad, and our friends and allies have grown. \nThe war in Iraq drained away financial resources, military forces, and \nintelligence experts from the war on terror. Osama bin Laden still \nremains at large, over 4 years after September 11. Where terrorists \nonce had training camps to hone their skills, they now have a war \nitself in Iraq. Sadly, our soldiers are their targets.\n  Recently, the Director of National Intelligence released a letter \napparently from Ayman al-Zawahiri, the No. 2 leader in al-Qaida, to Mr. \nal-Zarqawi, the group's top agent in Iraq. The letter provides a \nchilling portrait of a cold-blooded terrorist. I know many people will \ntry to use this letter to solidify their arguments of why we need to \nstay in Iraq. I don't advocate a precipitous tomorrow-like withdrawal \nfrom Iraq. I think that would be disastrous. But the Zawahiri letter is \none more piece of evidence that Iraq has now become a center of \nterrorist activity, whereas before the war it was not. The horrible \nirony of this war is that President Bush's invasion has created more \nenergy behind terrorism in the Middle East.\n  The President is offering America a false choice when he says we have \nto decide between resolve and retreat in Iraq. We must not just \nwithdraw, but we cannot simply stay the same course that has brought us \nto this place in time. If we simply withdraw now, the current \ninstability in Iraq would balloon into a full civil war, and we will \nhave produced another failed state, owned and operated by terrorists \nlike the Taliban in Afghanistan. If we just keep doing what we have \nbeen doing, we will continue to spend American tax dollars and, more \nimportantly, sacrifice the lives of our brave soldiers. We must take \npositive action to try to alter the strategic equation that has fueled \nterrorism and placed a heavy strain on our Army, National Guard, and \nReserves, constrained our options toward Iran and North Korea, and cost \nus nearly 2,000 American lives in Iraq.\n  Diplomacy has to be part of this new campaign. Our military leaders \nmake it clear, they cannot defeat the insurgency. The way to defeat \ninsurgency is politically and economically and diplomatically. Right \nnow there are almost no troops from Muslim nations who are fighting at \nthe side of the Iraqi government. There are almost no Arab diplomats in \nIraq. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice must reach out to the Arab \ngulf states and others and convince them that a secure and stable Iraq \nis in their interest as well as ours and that they must assume some of \nthe risk and burden of this enterprise. That is no easy sell, given the \nway we have approached this war to date. But it is an effort that we \nmust undertake, along with the Iraqis themselves.\n  The President needs to let the Iraqi people know that we will not \nremain indefinitely in Iraq, and communicate that message to the rest \nof the world as well. The Iraqi government and its security forces need \nto prepare for assuming all the functions expected of them by a free \nand sovereign Iraqi people to defend their own nation so American \ntroops can come home. The administration's admission, however, that \nonly one battalion of the Iraqi army is capable of operating on its own \ndoes not really bring us any closer to meeting this goal. It is the \nresponsibility of the administration to make it clear why we have not \ndone better in training and preparing Iraqi soldiers to replace \nAmerican soldiers, and it is the responsibility of this administration \nto train Iraqi security forces so that, in fact, our soldiers can come \nhome. It is time for the people and leaders of Iraq to take control of \ntheir own country and their own destiny.\n  We are not abandoning Iraq. Indeed, we and Iraqis themselves must \nreach out to other partners, especially the predominantly Muslim \ncountries, to collaborate in the consolidation of Iraqi security and \ndemocracy. We are not setting a date for departure. We are simply \nletting the Iraqis know, in the clearest possible terms, that we intend \nto bring our forces home. Reminding all concerned that we will not stay \nrefutes the assertion that we intend to establish permanent military \nbases in Iraq, an allegation that, unfortunately, fuels the insurgency.\n  We should do nothing that would mislead the Iraqis into thinking they \nhave unlimited time to take control of their own destiny. An unending \nAmerican occupation is neither in Iraq's interest nor in ours. If the \nIraqis made progress on Saturday, moving toward a constitution, moving \ntoward a government, moving toward a nation, we must tell them that \nthere is a responsibility of nationhood that goes beyond the obvious \nestablishment of government. The most important responsibility is to \nsecure your own borders, to protect your own people, to provide for the \ncommon defense of your own nation. Now that is a responsibility that \nmust be shouldered by the Iraqis. If we are uncertain in speaking to \nthis new Iraqi government about our plans and our timetable in Iraq, \nthen I think they will count on American soldiers to be there risking \ntheir lives indefinitely. That is unacceptable.\n  This administration has to make it clear that Iraqi army soldiers are \nprepared to shoulder that burden and to give relief to American \nsoldiers so that they can return home to a hero's welcome and to their \nfamilies who wait anxiously for that day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Vitter).

Mr. President, today I rise to discuss how we could be \ndoing better in our response to Hurricane Katrina. I just spoke with \none of Louisiana's Senators coming over to the Chamber to speak, and \nthe word that I heard with respect to the situation on the ground, \nparticularly the response of FEMA to the ongoing crisis, was \ndiscouraging. We can do better. We have to be able to do better for the \npeople there and for those who are footing the bill, the taxpayers.\n  Hurricane Katrina was truly an unprecedented event. It was in all \nlikelihood the worst natural disaster in our Nation's history. It was \ncertainly the worst natural disaster I have witnessed in my lifetime. I \ncan understand then that there might be some mistakes made, that there \nmight not be easy solutions to some of the problems faced by millions \nof Americans directly affected by this storm. But I believe there are \ntoo many key areas where we have experienced clear failures that just \ncannot be shrugged off. We have all heard about the slow initial \nresponse to the storm. We have also heard about the no-bid contracts \nthat probably weren't necessary. But I am going to speak for a few \nminutes today about a truly distressing failure that is leading to \nhardship among Katrina evacuees and is also wasting a lot of Federal \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  As my colleagues are aware, hundreds of thousands of gulf coast \nresidents have seen their homes severely\n\n[[Page S11506]]\n\ndamaged. Too many have seen them completely destroyed. Many of these \npeople are still living far away from home, with little or no hope of \nreturning to their communities any time soon, if ever. FEMA has moved \nswiftly in recent weeks to move Katrina evacuees out of temporary mass \nshelters that we saw in places such as the Astrodome in Houston. The \nproblem is that many evacuees are still living in hotels today, waiting \nfor FEMA to move them to longer term temporary housing. There have been \na number of media reports recently that FEMA is currently spending \nmillions of dollars every day to house hundreds of thousands of these \nevacuees in hotels around our country. The total cost of this program, \naccording to the Washington Post this morning, will likely approach \n$200 million by the end of this month alone. Worse yet, FEMA has \napparently not even been keeping track of the number of evacuees in \nhotels.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several articles on this subject be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 19, 2005]\n\n                   A Big Cut in Katrina's Hotel Bill\n\n              (By Jacqueline L.

Hsu)\n\n\n            Program Evacuees Were Miscounted, Red Cross Says\n\n       The American Red Cross said yesterday that it has vastly \n     overstated the number--and potential cost--of Hurricane \n     Katrina evacuees staying in hotel rooms because of errors in \n     how it interpreted its data.\n       Embarrassed officials from the charity acknowledged that \n     instead of housing 600,000 displaced people, the hotel \n     program--paid for by the federal government--is housing \n     200,000 storm evacuees.\n       Red Cross officials attributed the error to the misreading \n     of daily reports from a consultant handling the hotel \n     placements: Staff members mistook a cumulative tally of \n     people who had lived in hotels to date for the daily hotel \n     population.\n       ``Clearly, somewhere we went off the track,'' said Armond \n     Mascelli, Red Cross vice president for domestic response \n     operations.\n       Compounding the error, the Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency kept no independent count of the program's \n     beneficiaries or its costs, said FEMA spokeswoman Mary-\n     Margaret Walker. She said FEMA apparently was relying on the \n     erroneous numbers as it searched frantically for other \n     housing options for evacuees.\n       The revision in the number of people in hotels could cut in \n     half the $425 million estimate for the program. It is also \n     prompting FEMA to reevaluate long-term housing needs for \n     storm evacuees, said spokeswoman Frances Marine. This month, \n     FEMA's acting director, R. David Paulison, estimated that \n     400,000 to 600,000 households will require mid- to long-term \n     housing.\n       The Red Cross said yesterday that it now expects the \n     program to cost about $220 million. FEMA does not pay for \n     hotel rooms until it gets receipts, so the error has not cost \n     the agency, Marine said.\n       FEMA officials said 1.6 million people have registered for \n     assistance because of Hurricane Katrina and 700,000 people \n     have sought help for damage caused by Hurricane Rita.\n       The hotel program, conceived by the Red Cross as shelters \n     overflowed immediately after Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast, \n     has become the main housing program for evacuees.\n       This week, FEMA told housing industry representatives that \n     it plans to move storm evacuees out of hotels and into a less \n     costly rental-assistance program as soon as Dec. 1.\n       FEMA officials have concluded ``that it's going to be quite \n     a while before a lot of people can actually go back. \n     Therefore, keeping people in hotels and motels for any \n     extended period of time doesn't make sense,'' said Jim \n     Arbury, a senior vice president for the National Apartment \n     Association and National Multi Housing Council.\n       Red Cross officials said they learned of the error after a \n     New York Times reporter alerted them to it Monday night. It \n     comes as the charity tries to raise $2 billion in private \n     donations to cover its costs of caring for Katrina victims, a \n     figure that does not include the hotel program.\n       The blunder is a black eye for the Red Cross that could \n     taint the entire nonprofit sector, warned Paul Light, a New \n     York University professor of public service.\n       ``It's hugely embarrassing for the sector,'' Light said. \n     ``I don't believe there is any malfeasance here. But . . . \n     the notion that the Red Cross simply cannot track where the \n     money is going feeds into this growing concern that charities \n     cannot be trusted to spend their money wisely.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 13, 2005]\n\n           $11 Million a Day Spent on Hotels for Storm Relief\n\n                            (By Eric Lipton)\n\n       Washington, Oct. 12.--Straining to meet President Bush's \n     mid-October deadline to clear out shelters, the federal \n     government has moved hundreds of thousands of evacuees from \n     Hurricane Katrina into hotel rooms at a cost of about $11 \n     million a night, a strategy local officials and some members \n     of Congress criticize as incoherent and wasteful.\n       The number of people in hotels has grown by 60 percent in \n     the past two weeks as some shelters closed, reaching nearly \n     600,000 as of Tuesday. Even so, relief officials say they \n     cannot meet the deadline, as more than 22,000 people were \n     still in shelters in 14 states on Wednesday.\n       The reliance on hotels has been necessary, housing \n     advocates say, because the Federal Emergency and Management \n     Agency has had problems installing mobile homes and travel \n     trailers for evacuees and has been slow to place victims in \n     apartments that real estate executives say are available \n     throughout the southeast.\n       Hotel costs are expected to grow to as much as $425 million \n     by Oct. 24, a large expense never anticipated by the FEMA, \n     which is footing the bill. While the agency cannot say how \n     that number will affect overall spending for storm relief, \n     critics point out that hotel rooms, at an average cost of $59 \n     a night, are significantly more expensive than apartments and \n     are not suitable for months-long stays.\n       Officials in cities from Dallas to Atlanta, which are \n     accommodating thousands of evacuees, give credit for getting \n     90 percent of the victims out of shelters. But they say they \n     are frustrated by FEMA's record in helping place people in \n     more adequate housing.\n       ``Deplorable. Disappointing. Outrageous. That is how I feel \n     about it,'' said the Atlanta mayor, Shirley Franklin, a \n     Democrat, in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ``The \n     federal response has just been unacceptable. It is like \n     talking to a brick wall.''\n       Even conservative housing experts have criticized the Bush \n     administration's handling of the temporary housing response. \n     ``I am baffled,'' said Ronald D. Utt, a former senior \n     official at the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     and Reagan administration aide who is now a senior fellow at \n     the Heritage Foundation, the conservative research \n     organization. ``This is not incompetence. This is willful. \n     That is the only way I can explain it.''\n       Nicol Andrews, a FEMA spokeswoman, said the federal \n     government was moving as quickly as it could to find \n     temporary housing. But the scale of the catastrophe has made \n     it difficult, she said.\n       ``Clearly we have never encountered the size and scope of a \n     disaster like Hurricane Katrina,'' she said. ``Housing half a \n     million people is a challenge by any standard.''\n       The American Red Cross started the hotel program days after \n     Hurricane Katrina struck, when it became clear that the \n     shelters it had opened were not adequate to deal with the \n     600,000 to 700,000 families displaced by the storm, a \n     spokeswoman, Carrie Martin, said.\n       The hotel program was intended to last a couple of weeks \n     but has twice been extended by FEMA. Now Red Cross officials \n     are saying there is no end to the initiative, which pays for \n     192,424 rooms in 9,606 hotels across the United States, in a \n     range of cities as diverse as Casper, Wyo., and Anchorage, \n     Alaska.\n       Congress last month appropriated a $62.3 billion for the \n     relief effort, most of it designated for FEMA. The agency had \n     told Congress that it expected to spend more than $2 billion \n     to buy up to 300,000 travel trailers and mobile homes to \n     house displaced residents. The agency also planned to give \n     out $23.2 billion in assistance to victims for emergency \n     needs and for temporary housing and housing repairs.\n       But the temporary housing program has been troubled since \n     the start, observers say. Instead of setting up as many as \n     30,000 trailers and mobile homes every two weeks, as of \n     Tuesday, just 7,308 were occupied. Even counting berths on \n     the four ships that FEMA has leased and rooms on military \n     bases and elsewhere, the agency has provided only 10,940 \n     occupied housing units for victims in the three Gulf states.\n       FEMA, reacting to criticism that it might create super-\n     concentrated slums, has scaled back plans to build so-called \n     FEMA villes with up to 25,000 trailers.\n       Even a less ambitious plan--complexes with 200 or so \n     units--has been slow to unfold. FEMA officials cite the \n     reluctance by some rural parishes or landowners to welcome \n     evacuees.\n       But landowners and some state officials in Louisiana blame \n     bureaucratic fumbles by FEMA. Bill Bacque, co-owner of a \n     trailer park in Lafayette, La., said he offered property for \n     45 trailers within days of the storm. Negotiations with FEMA \n     were still under way this week, he said. ``Things do not move \n     fast,'' Mr. Bacque said.\n       Late last month, FEMA began handing out $2,358 for three \n     months so that families in shelters or hotels could rent \n     apartments.\n       To date, more than 415,000 households have been approved \n     for that aid, totaling $979 million. But FEMA officials \n     cannot say how many families have used the money for \n     apartments, or simply spent it on expenses while also living \n     in a government-financed hotel room.\n       David Degruy, his wife, Debra, and their six children, of \n     New Orleans, have done just that while staying in two rooms \n     paid for by FEMA at the Greenway Inn and Suites in Houston.\n       ``We're trying to save the money so that when do get in a \n     house we'll be able to buy things,'' Mr. Degruy said. ``We \n     eat out sometimes, we buy clothes, personal hygiene things.''\n       Some officials criticize FEMA for a passive approach in \n     dealing with cities and hurricane evacuees.\n\n[[Page S11507]]\n\n       Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, who \n     sits on a House panel that helps oversee the housing effort, \n     complained that it was unreasonable for the federal \n     government to expect that a family led by jobless parents, \n     with no car, little savings and little familiarity with a new \n     city could independently find an apartment.\n       ``The administration's policy is incoherent and socially \n     seriously flawed,'' he said in an interview.\n       Real estate officials say that although there are few \n     available apartments in Louisiana, there are many vacancies \n     in apartment buildings across the South, including perhaps \n     300,000 in Texas alone.\n       ``What are these guys doing?'' Jim Arbury, an official with \n     the National Multi Housing Council, a group of building \n     owners and managers, said of FEMA. ``All of this housing is \n     available now.''\n       Some housing experts say the Bush administration should \n     follow the approach taken after the 1994 Northridge \n     earthquake in Los Angeles, when displaced residents were \n     given prepaid housing vouchers instead of having to negotiate \n     and pay a lease on their own.\n       ``We are wasting money hand over fist because we did not \n     deploy the right policy tools,'' said Bruce Katz, a vice \n     president at the Brookings Institution, a liberal research \n     group in Washington. ``We could have thousands, if not tens \n     of thousands of families, in stable permanent housing right \n     now. And we would not have to turn to these costly measures, \n     like hotels, motels and cruise ships.''\n       Ms. Andrews, the FEMA spokeswoman, defended the housing \n     policy. ``The program is designed to give those who it \n     affects the most the control over their own lives,'' she \n     said.\n       Some cities, including Houston and San Antonio, have taken \n     an active role in helping families find housing by creating \n     their own voucher program, identifying vacant units, paying \n     for six-month leases and then turning over the unit to the \n     evacuees. FEMA has promised to reimburse the cities for the \n     housing costs.\n       ``You can't just give people a check and say, `Good luck, \n     we will see you,' '' said San Antonio's assistant city \n     manager, Christopher J. Brady. ``It would not be a sufficient \n     solution.''\n       FEMA officials said other cities can set up similar \n     programs. But Mayor Franklin of Atlanta and Mayor Laura \n     Miller of Dallas have said they cannot do so without being \n     paid in advance by the federal government.\n       Expressing frustration that she could not offer more help \n     to the 39,000 displaced people who have come to Georgia, \n     Mayor Franklin said FEMA's expectations that her city could \n     advance housing money were unrealistic.\n       ``Our government is not large enough to do that,'' she \n     said. ``We can't absorb the costs.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 12, 2005]\n\n                Housing Aid Called Too Much, Too Little\n\n                          (By Spencer S. Hsu)\n\n\n         fema critics cite waste as evacuees stran to pay rent\n\n       The Federal Emergency Management Agency's evolving efforts \n     to shelter Hurricane Katrina victims continue to waste huge \n     amounts of taxpayer dollars and could soon leave many \n     evacuees short of money and facing eviction, according to \n     renter advocates and housing industry officials.\n       The concerns focus on FEMA's extension of an $8.3 million-\n     a-day program to house 549,000 people in hotel rooms beyond \n     an Oct. 15 deadline and its handling of a new rental \n     assstance program, which offers displaced families a lump sum \n     of $2,358 for three months' rent. The disaster agency has \n     previously drawn criticism for its troubled $1 billion-plus \n     effort to house hurricane evacuees in 125,000 trailers.\n       The National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy \n     group, said that ecause the rent program is based on the \n     $786-per-month national median rent for a two-bedroom \n     apartment--rather than city-by-city rates used by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development--many evacuees \n     taken to more costly cities are already short on cash. \n     Typically, the coalition said, renters must pay a deposit and \n     first month's rent; it cited Washington as an example, where \n     the average rent is about $1,100 and where about 5,000 people \n     have been resettled.\n       Apartment owners say they also are encountering problems \n     collecting rents because FEMA hands money directly to storm \n     victims, instead of using housing vouchers or payments to \n     landlords as HUD does for some low-income renters. Some \n     families that left their homes with only what they could \n     carry have used FEMA's cash for food, clothing and \n     transportation.\n       ``We felt if we did the right thing, FEMA would step up and \n     provide housing assistance for all these folks. Here we are \n     four weeks later, and a lot of these folks simply do not have \n     rent money to pay,'' said Kirk H. Tate, a member of Houston's \n     Katrina housing task force and a parter at Orion Real Estate \n     Services Inc., which manages 12,000 apartments in the city.\n       Houston authorities welcomed 20,000 Katrina households into \n     rental units in as few as three or four days, mostly waiving \n     deposit and rent requirements, Tate said. ``The last thihg we \n     want to have to do is ask for them to move out when they \n     can't pay the rent,'' he said, but property owners have \n     mortgages, utilities and expenses to pay and may need to \n     start eviction proceedings by month's end.\n       Benicha McCraney, 49, left New Orleans two days before \n     Hurricane Katrina with two children and a suitcase holding \n     three days' worth of clothes. Now the family lives in a \n     $1,096-per-month two-bedroom apartment in a suburban Houston \n     complex called Tranquility Bay.\n       She received $2,358 for three months from FEMA but \n     estimates her monthly expenses at about $1,700.\n       With $1,500 in savings and her husband, a police officer, \n     fearing he will be laid off in New Orleans, McCraney is \n     worried about paying for children's clothes when the weather \n     cools.\n       McCraney is not facing eviction yet, but having lost her \n     home to floodwaters, she is postponing replacing the worn \n     tires on her car. ``I would like to stay here as long as I \n     can,'' she said. ``I don't have anywhere else in the world to \n     go.''\n       The warnings come as a wide range of players in the \n     nation's housing and lodging industries express mounting \n     exasperation with FEMA's shifting efforts to cope with the \n     evacuee crisis. Although the administration has proposed \n     cruise ships, trailers, President Bush's nascent ``urban \n     homesteading'' initiative, hotels and now apartment grants, \n     they say FEMA is ignoring advice from experts inside and \n     outside the government.\n       ``The normal FEMA programs just aren't working. They may be \n     good for 1,500, 2,000 people, but when you're talking a half \n     a million, they do not work,'' said Douglas S. Culkin, \n     executive vice president of the National Apartment \n     Association.\n       Culkin said 1 million rental units are vacant in the \n     southeastern United States at half the rate of FEMA's $1,770-\n     a-month hotel program. He called the current spending rate of \n     $250 million a month ``a horrendous waste of tax dollars.''\n       Linda Couch, deputy director of the low-income housing \n     coalition, agreed that taxpayer money could be saved by using \n     vacant apartment units. ``If the federal government made a \n     choice to subsidize them at the rents they are available at, \n     it looks like it still would be less than having them live in \n     a hotel,'' she said.\n       FEMA spokeswoman Nicol Andrews said that the agency's \n     rental aid program can be extended to 18 months. If renters \n     keep receipts and show that their housing costs exceed $786 a \n     month, FEMA will allow them to spend more on rent, Andrews \n     said. But Congress has set a $26,200 limit per family for \n     FEMA aid of all kinds, including home repairs, for Katrina \n     victims.\n       Andrews acknowledged that the trailer process is not moving \n     as fast as the agency would like. She declined to comment on \n     criticism from the housing sector but noted that FEMA is \n     establishing huge new programs and that shelter populations \n     have dropped 75 percent in two weeks.\n       The scale of Katrina's exodus is immense and growing. On \n     Thursday, FEMA's acting director, R. David Paulison, \n     increased the agency's estimate of the number of families \n     expected to need housing for up to several months, from \n     300,000 to between 400,000 and 600,000.\n       FEMA said Friday that the number of people in temporary \n     shelters, which Bush has pledged to clear by mid-October, has \n     fallen to 31,500 from a peak of more than 300,000. FEMA is \n     providing rental assistance to 412,000 displaced households \n     and has registered 2 million storm victims.\n       ``The recovery process for Hurricane Katrina will be \n     neither fast nor easy,'' Paulison said. ``Many . . . \n     rightfully are concerned about the cost, as we all are.''\n       Critics in Congress and elsewhere have focused on large \n     trailer contracts and the difficulty FEMA has encountered in \n     acquiring trailers and sites for trailer parks. So far about \n     6,800 FEMA trailers are occupied by emergency workers and \n     evacuees across the Gulf Coast. Some also have criticized \n     spending $236 million to house 7,000 people on three Carnival \n     Cruise Lines ships.\n       Last week, three major national apartment owner \n     associations criticized FEMA for ignoring their offers of \n     help and expressed bewilderment over why the agency extended \n     the hotel program. The average room rate of $59 per day is \n     more than twice the cost of rental vouchers in HUD's low-\n     income Section 8 housing program and the rental aid provided \n     by FEMA and HUD to Katrina victims. It also exceeds the \n     median monthly rent in some of the nation's most expensive \n     cities.\n       The groups cited 50,000 vacant apartments in Dallas-Fort \n     Worth alone and 1 million in the southeastern United States \n     at rents that range from $700 to $1,200 a month-- vacancy \n     totals confirmed by others outside the industry.\n       ``Our message is simple. There are currently tens of \n     thousands of available rental units that would offer evacuees \n     the opportunity to more quickly recover from their \n     devastating losses,'' the National Multi Housing Council, the \n     National Apartment Association and the National Leased \n     Housing Association wrote to HUD Secretary Alphonso Jackson \n     and Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. ``To extend \n     the hotel program indefinitely prolongs homelessness and \n     makes no sense,'' they said.\n       Housing officials point to the city of Dallas's Project \n     Exodus as an example of better planning. It has placed about \n     1,000 people in 481 apartments using $2.5 million raised \n     through contributions by individuals and large companies. The \n     units rent for HUD market rates, including utilities. \n     Although city funds are set to expire after 60 days, Dallas \n     expects FEMA to pick up costs after that.\n\n[[Page S11508]]\n\n       Houston also has agreed to pay up to 12 months of housing \n     assistance for Katrina victims, hoping for FEMA \n     reimbursement, Tate said.\n       About 37,000 evacuees are in Dallas area hotel rooms, said \n     Miller, and more than 150,000 evacuees are in rooms across \n     Texas.\n       ``We said, We can't wait for FEMA,''' said Dallas Mayor \n     Laura Miller. ``What worries me is reading about all these \n     other cities who are waiting for trailer homes to show up so \n     they can re-create these trailer villages. That would be the \n     worst thing you can do.''\n\n  Mr. CARPER. While it is certainly reasonable to house evacuees in \nhotels on a short-term basis, this situation is simply unacceptable \nnearly 2 months after Katrina struck the coast. I am told that real \nestate and housing experts have pointed out that perhaps hundreds of \nthousands of suitable and likely much more affordable apartments could \nbe had throughout the gulf coast region. I am certain that they could \nprobably be had for significantly less than the cost of a hotel room. \nIn addition, the Washington Post recently reported that a joint FEMA-\nHUD rental assistance program is likely wasting millions of dollars. In \nat least some cases, the program is not doing much to help evacuees in \nsome parts of the country find suitable housing.\n  Each evacuee participating in the voucher program, according to the \nPost, initially receives a subsidy amount based on the national median \nrent for 3 months. In some parts of the country, such as Houston, the \nnational median rent probably isn't enough to find suitable housing. In \nother communities, it might be more than enough. This means that \nKatrina evacuees in some parts of the country may be getting more \nassistance than they need, and those in higher cost areas might not be \ngetting what they need to provide for their families.\n  It has been suggested that the solution to the housing crisis in the \ngulf might be to place evacuees in trailers or some other form of \nmanufactured housing. But I have heard reports that FEMA is buying many \nof its trailers straight off the lot at retail prices. I have also \nheard that there are thousands of trailers just sitting around \nunoccupied in vacant lots. We have all heard stories about how \nmiserable some of the trailer camps are to live in that FEMA has set up \nin places like Florida.\n  We can do better than this. FEMA owes it to Katrina victims and to \nthe American taxpayers to find a more comfortable, less expensive way \nto house our fellow Americans who are going through such a difficult \ntime right now. That is why I am sending a letter today to Acting FEMA \nDirector David Paulison to ask him to tell us exactly what FEMA's plan \nis to get Katrina evacuees out of hotels and into more stable living \nenvironments so that they can begin the process of bringing their lives \nas close to normal as possible.\n  The problems and the waste we are seeing in FEMA's Katrina housing \nprogram remind me yet again that we need to do some work to ensure that \nthe money we are spending to help Katrina victims is spent wisely and \neffectively. To date we have approved in the Congress $62 billion for \nKatrina. More money will probably be needed, but given the number of \nstories we see almost on a daily basis now about financial \nmismanagement, about confusion at FEMA, and the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we should not be writing a blank check.\n  A recovery effort this large needs additional oversight to make sure \nthe money we are spending is going to the people who need it most, to \nmake sure we eliminate wasteful spending and get the most bang for our \nbuck, and to make sure we reduce the potential for fraud.\n  It is my understanding that we are not sure what legislation is \ncoming to the floor next week. I have a suggestion. The Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, of which I am a member, \napproved two bills a couple of weeks ago that I believe are desperately \nneeded to make sure Katrina recovery funds are spent properly and go to \nthe people who are most in need.\n  One of the bills we passed would appoint a chief financial officer to \noversee the day-to-day use of Federal funds in the cleanup and \nreconstruction efforts underway in the gulf. I cosponsored this \nlegislation with Senator Coburn of Oklahoma and Senator Obama of \nIllinois. It enjoys bipartisan support, including the cosponsorship, I \nbelieve, of both the Republican leader and Democratic leader of the \nSenate.\n  The chief financial officer would oversee the various Federal \nagencies involved in the recovery efforts and hold them financially \naccountable. The CFO would be Congress's personal watchdog, issuing \nperiodic financial reports about whether the money is going to the \npeople who need it the most and whether it is being used to hire local \nworkers who need jobs.\n  The second bill would expand the authority of the inspector general \nassigned to Iraq reconstruction to oversee the Katrina recovery \nefforts. The expanded office would audit recovery operations and \ninvestigate allegations of waste, fraud, and inefficiency.\n  Together, these two bills would better protect American taxpayers and \nbring some much-needed accountability to the recovery efforts.\n  We shouldn't settle for the stories we see in the papers every day \nabout the lack of decent housing for Katrina victims or the lack of \ncompetition for Federal contracts. We shouldn't read stories about \nwaste and resign ourselves to the fact that waste is just something \nthat happens in the Federal Government. We can do better, and we must. \nWe owe it to the American taxpayers to do better, and we owe it to \nKatrina's victims to do better.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, I think it is appropriate this morning \nthat those of us in elected office, and every American, show some \nappreciation for what is going on in Iraq this morning.\n  I turned on the television and saw a new face of Iraq. I saw a judge \nschooled in the law, loyal to the law, presiding over a trial of Saddam \nHussein, a person who was schooled in thuggery, loyal to himself and \nhis agenda, one of the most brutal murderers the Middle East has known. \nAnd I saw an attorney general laying out the case against Saddam \nHussein.\n  How did that all happen? It happened through sheer will. First, \nviolence had to replace diplomacy because diplomacy was failing. The \neffort to contain Saddam Hussein's regime, to rein it in, to clearly \nunderstand what his purposes were about weapons of mass destruction, to \nget him to stay out of the upheaval of the Middle East, to be a \nproductive member of the Middle East society, the world community, in \nmy opinion, failed miserably and we had to resort to force and violence \nto oust a man who had perpetuated many crimes against his own people \nand his neighbors.\n  How did it happen, at the end of the day? It happened through the \nbravery, commitment, and sacrifice of the American military, their \ncoalition partners, and the Iraqi people themselves.\n  We have lost around 2,000 troops since the war began. To those \nfamilies who have lost loved ones, there is nothing I can say other \nthan I am sorry and, in my opinion, for what it is worth, your loved \nones have advanced the cause of freedom by participating in a military \noperation to take Saddam Hussein off the throne and into the dock as a \ndefendant.\n  To those coalition members who have stood with us and who have \nsacrificed, thank you. Because of your sacrifice, the cause of freedom \nhas been advanced.\n  We do not appreciate enough, in my opinion, the sacrifice of the \nIraqi people. I believe it is the judge or one member of the court \nwhose brother was assassinated. To sit in judgment of Saddam Hussein is \nno easy thing to do. They are literally risking their lives to be a \nprosecutor, a policeman, or member of the army. They wear a target on\n\n[[Page S11509]]\n\ntheir back. Their families are at risk because the terrorists see it as \na risk to their way of life. Those who take up arms against the \nterrorists in Iraq are literally changing the course of history.\n  To those men and women who have served in the American military, \nthose who have lost life and limb, I hope you take pride in what is \nhappening today. To the families of the loved ones who have been lost, \nthose who have been injured, and those who are still serving, because \nof your sacrifice and commitment, your willingness to leave your \ncomfort zones, to leave your family and friends, Guard members and \nReservists leaving their businesses and loved ones behind, you have \nchanged the course of Middle East history.\n  At the end of the day, we can't kill enough terrorists to win. \nTerrorism is about hijacking of a great religion. There is no place in \nthe terrorist world for a different faith, people of moderation in the \nIslamic community, and there is no role for a woman. For that to \nchange, it is going to have to be deeper than force of arms. It is \ngoing to have to be a transformation of a culture.\n  The culture of the rule of the gun versus the rule of law is \nhappening before our eyes. What is going on today in Iraq is a sea \nchange in the Middle East. It is about time a dictator in that region \nanswers for his crimes. It is about time people in that region be \nallowed to live their lives in a normal fashion and raise their kids in \npeace.\n  That day is still far away, but we are closer than we have ever been. \nSo to those men and women serving in our American military and those \nwho have suffered, congratulations and God bless. Because of your \nsacrifice and those sacrifices of our coalition partners and the Iraqi \npeople, there has been a sea change in the Middle East and you deserve \nall the credit.\n  I hope the American people will be patient to see this thing through \nbecause what happens in Iraq is directly related to our own security.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to make a \nstatement about the situation taking place in Darfur and to update my \ncolleagues. But I wish to speak briefly to my colleagues and to others \nabout the amazing trial of Saddam Hussein that has started.\n  This is a trial that is going to reveal a great deal about what took \nplace, the carnage that happened under his rule, and what he did to the \npeople of Iraq. I worked with a number of Iraqi dissidents over a \nperiod of time. The things they reported--the mass graves, the \npersecutions, the intimidation by this Government of Saddam Hussein--is \nsomething that has not been well revealed. Hopefully, that is going to \ncome out in this trial. We will see change as it progresses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11509-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11509-S11510]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 DARFUR\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to update my colleagues on what \nis taking place in Sudan in the Darfur region. This is something about \nwhich I spoke several times in this Chamber. It is a genocide as the \nSenate, the House, and the President declared it a genocide. Others at \nthe U.N. call it crimes against humanity. Under either definition, it \nis a horrific set of circumstances that has occurred in that region. \nYet the response to date has still not been effective. People are \ncontinuing to be killed and slaughtered and run out of their villages, \nand the African Union troops have not succeeded in securing peace in \nthat region. I want to update my colleagues about what is taking place.\n  The mandate of the African Union troops--and this is the African \ncountries that have formed the African Union force--is simply to \nmonitor and report on the current cease-fire. That is insufficient. I \nam going to detail why it is insufficient and what has happened because \nof their insufficient mandate and rules of engagement not being \nappropriate for the circumstances.\n  To date, they have largely written and filed away reports. Without a \nmandate robust enough to protect the civilians or prevent violence or \nassistance robust enough to provide a well-sized and equipped force, \nthere is not much hope for the people seeking safety in Darfur.\n  A few weeks ago, the African Union came out with their strongest \nstatement regarding the violence. This was a clear call for the \ninternational community to shine the spotlight on this crisis and to \nrealize the implications it will have on the entire region.\n  While the parties are engaged in the sixth round of peace talks--and \nthat is progress; we do have peace talks engaged in by the people in \nDarfur, the Government in Sudan, the jingaweit militia that has been \ngiven equipment by the Government in Sudan--violence continues to take \nplace even as these peace talks move forward.\n  In the last few weeks, attacks have been carried out by the jingaweit \nmilitia, the Government forces, and the rebel movement--all three. The \nAfrican Union announced:\n\n       You would recall that in the past one month, we witnessed a \n     series of violations in Darfur, with widespread violence \n     against villages, commercial and humanitarian conveys, and \n     even IDP camps.\n\n  These are camps where individual citizens are going to get away from \nthe raids and carnage.\n\n       This rendered the work of the humanitarian agencies and \n     NGOs in the area difficult and, in some cases, they were \n     forced to suspend their activities.\n\n  There was an unprecedented move against IDP camps and the first \nreports of the Government of Sudan's use of helicopters since January. \nA number of coordinated attacks has been reported since mid-September \ninvolving hundreds of jingaweit militia--this is the militia armed by \nthe Government of Sudan--and Government forces working together killing \nand injuring many and displacing thousands more. Just this week, a \nnumber of civilians were killed in fighting that took place in the town \nof Kutum after a rebel and Government force clashed.\n  The African Union articulates:\n\n       A clearly premeditated and well rehearsed combined \n     operation was carried out by the Government of Sudan military \n     and police at approximately 11 a.m. in the town of Tawilla \n     and its IDP camps in North Darfur. The Government of Sudan \n     forces used approximately 41 trucks, 7 land cruisers in the \n     operation which resulted in a number of deaths, massive \n     displacement of civilians and the destruction of several \n     houses in the surrounding areas, as well as some tents in the \n     IDP camp.\n\n  In addition to these violations, there are reports that the \nGovernment of Sudan has painted their military trucks in the African \nUnion colors, making it extremely difficult for civilians to \ndistinguish between monitors or attackers. All parties have violated \nthe cease-fire agreement on several occasions since it was established \nin 2004. Conditions for humanitarian organizations remain extremely \ndifficult. This week, the United Nations announced its plan to withdraw \nall nonessential staff from Darfur.\n  In addition to an upsurge in violence by the Government and the \ngovernment-backed jingaweit militia, I am very troubled by the recent \nviolence aimed at the African Union by rebel groups. In particular, the \nrecent kidnappings and killings of African Union troops should be \nstrongly condemned and swift justice should be brought to the \nperpetrators of these crimes. The African Union has called for these \nevents to be brought to the attention of the Security Council in their \ncommunique of October 10 of this year.\n  The New York Times reported yesterday that some of the once-\ngovernment-backed militia groups are fracturing and targeting \ngovernment-run entities, such as police stations. Infighting amongst \nthe rebels is another common hurdle to achieving peace. This is the \nchaos that has plagued Darfur.\n  Ambassador John Bolton's recent decision to block the UN Envoy on \nGenocide from testifying before the Security Council has undoubtedly \nraised some eyebrows. However, if he means what he says--that actions \nspeak louder than words--then I urge the Congress, the administration, \nthe United Nations, and the international community to do something. I \napplaud Ambassador Bolton's recognition of the fact that the current \narms embargo is not adequate, it must be expanded, and there must be \ncompliance.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider these recent events and to redouble \nour efforts to bring an end to the genocide that is happening as I \nspeak. I urge my colleagues and the chairman of the\n\n[[Page S11510]]\n\nForeign Relations Committee to quickly report out the Darfur Peace and \nAccountability Act. I have not spoken directly to it, but I will speak \nabout getting this act passed. We need to get it put into law.\n  This legislation increases pressure on Khartoum, provides greater \nsupport for the African Union mission in Darfur to help protect \ncivilians and impose sanctions on individuals who are responsible for \nthe atrocities, and encourages the appointment of a U.S. special envoy \nto help advance a comprehensive peace process for Darfur and all of \nSudan. It also calls for the United States to push for a strong \nSecurity Council resolution, amongst other things, that expands the \narms embargo.\n\n  We can no longer remain indifferent to the suffering Africans of \nDarfur. We must move beyond the politics and agree on the fundamentals \nthat will help save lives immediately. It is quite simple. When the \n``never'' is removed from ``never again,'' it will happen--again and \nagain and again. We cannot be silent and inactive on Darfur as people \ndie.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the people of Iraq \non writing another chapter in the history of their nation. After the \ncoalition forces toppled Saddam's oppressive regime, many believed it \nwould take years until the Iraqis would be in control of their \ngovernment apparatus. They were wrong. On June 28, 2004, the transfer \nof power took place and Iraqis became the rulers of their nation. On \nJanuary 20, 2005, millions of people, including women, risked their \nlives to choose the members of a temporary Parliament responsible for \ndrafting the new constitution. This past weekend, millions of Iraqis \nlined up to cast their ballots in more than 6,000 polling places across \nIraq.\n  The Iraqi people's vision of a free and stable Iraq led them to an \nimportant milestone--voting on a democratic Iraqi-written constitution. \nLast weekend, through will and determination, more than 60 percent of \nthe eligible voters in Iraq chose to speak up against tyranny and \noppression--a higher percentage of voter turnout than in the 2004 U.S. \nPresidential election.\n  What we saw in Iraq on October 15, 2005, proved that even those \noppressed for decades will peacefully choose their own future when \ngiven a chance to participate in a fair and open electoral process.\n  There had been much speculation that a majority of Sunnis would \nboycott the referendum. However, until the last few days before the \nvote, leaders of the Shi'a and the Kurds worked relentlessly to \nconvince their Sunni countrymen and women to vote either for or against \nthe constitution. Their work came to fruition when millions of Sunnis \nlined up to cast their ballots and decide the future of their country.\n  While many Sunnis voted against the proposed constitution, the \nreferendum sent a clear message that all Iraqis are willing to invest \nin the democratic process.\n  By casting their ballots, millions of Iraqis also sent a strong \nmessage against terrorism. Ideology of hate has no place in the world, \nno place in Islam, and most certainly no place in Iraq. Terrorists' \ntactics of striking innocent men and women and children are despicable \nand cowardly. Terror has not derailed the political process, nor the \nestablishment of the rule of law. Despite fears of retaliation by al-\nQaida and other terrorists, millions of Iraqis chose to participate in \nthe process that will decide the future of their nation.\n  The Iraqi security forces have also started to make a significant \ndifference. According to our military leaders and officials on the \nground, the Iraqi security forces were clearly in the lead in securing \npolling sites around the country. Backed by the coalition forces, the \nIraqi military presence was increased by 35 percent since January. \nPress reports indicated that scattered instances of violence were \nquickly suppressed by the Iraqis.\n  This accomplishment indicates the willingness of the Iraqi security \nforces to stand up to insurgents and protect their fellow countrymen. \nWith each Iraqi soldier trained and equipped to carry out the mission, \nIraq draws closer to be able to stand on its own and protect Iraq's \nfreedom.\n  As they have learned the power of the ballot box, Iraqis will soon be \nexperiencing the strength of the rule of law during the trial of Saddam \nHussein that convenes today. Only a couple thousand years ago, \nthousands of Iraqis--including women and children--were killed, \ntortured, and wrongfully imprisoned. Nevertheless, the current Iraqi \nGovernment fully understands the importance of a fair trial and the \nprecedents it will establish. As a result of these advancements in \nIraq, the country's most brutal dictator will face trial by a jury of \nhis peers, a trial that thousands of Saddam's victims never received. \nThe world will pay close attention as the Iraqi judicial system moves \nforward with this challenge. I am confident the Iraqis will adhere to \nthe highest standard of the rule of law to reach a proper conclusion.\n  Today, the successful referendum in Iraq would not have been possible \nwithout our brave men and women in uniform who were called by our \nNation's leaders to perform a noble but difficult task. Their \ncommitment and dedication to peace and prosperity around the globe has \nnever been more evident. Nearly 150,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines are deployed in Iraq, doing their duty with pride, patriotism, \nand perseverance. Our success in Iraq and Afghanistan has not come \nwithout cost. Those who have fallen have served a cause greater than \nthemselves and deserve a very special honor. My heart goes out to the \nfamilies whose sons and daughters have made the ultimate sacrifice.\n  The people of Iraq have clearly spoken of their desire for a free and \ndemocratic Iraq. The terrorists understand that their only chance is to \nbreak the will of the American people and force us to retreat. We will \nnot waver in our support of the Iraqi people. We will not waver in our \nsupport of the democratic process and the rule of law. And we will not \nwaver in our cause for freedom in a land that has known nothing but \noppression. The lessons learned in previous world conflicts have proven \nthat when the stakes are so high, we must remain firm, resist the \nenemy, and fight until the war is won.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S11510, October 19, 2005, the following sentence \nappeared: We will not waiver in our support of the Iraqi people. \nWe will not waiver in our support of the democratic process and \nthe rule of law. And we will not waiver in our cause for freedom \nin a land that has known nothing but oppression\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: We will not waver \nin our support of the Iraqi people. We will not waver in our \nsupport of the democratic process and the rule of law. And we will \nnot waver in our cause for freedom in a land that has known \nnothing but oppression\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Mr. President, our Nation has a leader who has made it clear that \nwinning the war on terror is a defining moment for the civilized world. \nSince September 11, 2001, President Bush has taken bold steps to ensure \nthe safety and the security of the United States, especially against \nterrorist organizations and the nation states that support them.\n  Specifically, since President Bush has taken office, the United \nStates, under his leadership, has--and I would like to list a number of \nsuccesses against terrorist organizations--overtaken two terrorist \nregimes, rescued two nations and liberated some 50 million people; \ncaptured or killed close to two-thirds of known senior al-Qaida \noperatives; captured or killed 45 of the 55 most wanted in Iraq, \nincluding Iraq's deposed dictator, Saddam Hussein; hunted down \nthousands of terrorists and regime remnants in Afghanistan and Iraq; \ndisrupted terrorist cells on most continents and likely prevented a \nnumber of planned attacks.\n  This is an astounding record of accomplishment for our Commander in \nChief, his national security staff, and the phenomenal men and women of \nour military services. The United States went to war in Afghanistan and \nIraq, risking significant loss of life and treasure to protect our way \nof life. Our goals are clear and twofold: Destroy the nexus of \nterrorism and weapons of mass destruction that personified the two \nousted regimes and create in their stead stable, democratic states able \nto participate in the modern world today. And we see the results of \nthat successful effort in both Afghanistan and Iraq. We succeeded in \nour first goal, having killed or captured perpetrators and supporters \nof the enemy terrorists.\n  As I discussed previously, the courageous people of Afghanistan and \nIraq are making remarkable progress toward adoption of constitutional \nreforms to secure momentum for a lasting democratic independence. Our \nCommander in Chief deserves recognition for these achievements. America\n\n[[Page S11511]]\n\nis safer because he took action, and the world will be a better place \nwhen the foes of freedom are defeated. We must stay the course and \nfollow through with determination and perseverance. We must turn to \nthose who doubt our mission and speak of the tremendous courage being \nshown by the Iraqi and Afghan people who are just beginning to enjoy \nthe fruits of freedom. We must constantly thank our men and women in \nour Armed Forces who have so valiantly served our Nation, and we must \nremind ourselves that the global war on terrorism is not about religion \nor ethnicity; it is about freedom and whether we will allow others to \ndictate our freedom. We must not give in to the ideology of terror, and \nwe must remain committed to those who need our assistance so much.\n  As we review the history of Saddam Hussein as he begins standing \ntrial today, I view with optimism the ability of the Iraqi people to \nconduct a fair and just trial. They face a history of continued \ninhumane actions by a ruthless dictator in Saddam Hussein for thousands \nupon thousands of people who were massacred and killed for no real, \napparent reason other than the fact that they disagreed with Saddam, \nwho was the ruthless dictator in charge.\n  History takes us back many years. Saddam came into power a number of \ndecades ago, and during that time we saw a record number of injustices \nthat occurred to the Iraqi people. We saw, in 1980, the persecution of \nthe Faylee Kurds. We saw, in 1983, the Kurdish massacres targeted \nagainst Barzanis and the KDP. In 1988, we saw the Anfal campaign. As \nmany as 182,000 people disappeared during this time period.\n  In 1988, we saw in Halabja the Saddam regime launched chemical \nattacks against more than 40 of its own villagers. On March 16, 1988, \nthe regime dropped sarin and VX on the town of Halabja, killing more \nthan 5,000 people and injuring thousands more. Many of the survivors \nsuffered long-term medical complications, and thousands died. There \nhave been significant instances of birth defects in children born to \nparents of Halabja, and many are still suffering from the effects of \nthe attack.\n  In 1991, during the Shi'a uprising in the south, the regime brutally \nmassacred tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians. Also in 1991, \nonce Kurdish autonomy was declared, many Kurds living below the green \nline were massacred, leaving mass gravesites in the Kirkuk region. In \n1991, with an uprising in Najaf, we saw again the demonstrated \nbrutality of this regime. As it put down the uprising, many of the \nperpetrators were rounded up, were arrested, and many of the \nparticipants who were placed in jails were tortured.\n  The Marsh Arabs, whose people had lived for thousands of years in the \nlongstanding Marsh Arab area, were forced to leave the land after it \nwas no longer cultivable and habitable because the regime decided to \ndivert their waters to other sources.\n  All Iraqis who opposed or questioned the leadership of Saddam \nHussein, whether Shi'a, Sunni, Christian, Kurd, Turkoman, or other, \nwere systematically intimidated, tortured, and executed during the \nregime.\n  We are now in a new chapter of the trial of Saddam Hussein. Many of \nthese atrocities will come to light. As I mentioned earlier, I have a \nlot of faith in the Iraqi people, that they will conduct the trial in a \nresponsible way following international law and also, in some \ninstances, applying their local law.\n  The credit for freeing the Iraqi people I think goes to the men and \nwomen in the Armed Forces, it goes to the American people who have \nshown perseverance through this period of time, and also to our \nPresident, our great leader, who has demonstrated strong leadership not \nonly in America but across the world in this fight for freedom. The \nreal beneficiaries are going to be the Iraqi and the Afghani people.\n  I, along with many other Americans, will be watching as the trial \nruns its course. This is not going to be an American trial or any kind \nof world trial, although international procedures will be followed. But \nit will be a trial that will reflect the freedoms of the Iraqi people \nand reflect their form of justice.\n  I wish the Iraqi people well. I commend our President for a job very \nwell done. Again, I want to recognize the sacrifice and commitment of \nour men and women in the military who have been so brave and \nforthright, and have done overall a great job in representing America \non the battlefield in their fight for freedom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding is \nthe time at this point had been reserved for statements regarding the \nelections in Iraq. Am I correct? What is the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business time has now expired.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the time be extended for a period \nnot to exceed 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my distinguished colleague from Colorado \nhas spoken very eloquently with regard to the elections in Iraq. I \nwould like to add a few thoughts of my own, for it was truly a \nmomentous event in the sense that a nation which had not had any \ngovernment since 1920 was given the opportunity to begin its course \ntoward joining the nations of the free world to have some form of \ndemocracy of their own choosing--and I underline that: Of their own \nchoosing. They thereby take a place in the world with a responsibility \nfor securing the basic freedoms people worldwide desire.\n  On Saturday, October 15, 2005, the Iraqi people, once again, \nfollowing their historic election in January of this year, took another \nsignificant step forward in Iraq. We saw millions of Iraqis indicate \ntheir willingness to embrace the democratic process by virtue of their \nvoting. There was a strong turnout nationwide, a significantly higher \nturnout than we anticipated in certain areas. This turnout, \nparticularly in the Sunni regions, is more remarkable because it was \noften in the face of insurgent intimidation.\n  We all observed three important signs of Iraqi progress in the events \nof October 15th. First, the electoral process proceeded as planned. \nInsurgent efforts to disrupt the elections that were attempted \nthroughout the summer and right up to the elections simply did not \nsucceed.\n  Second, Iraqi Government's outreach to Sunni leaders during the \nconstitutional drafting process is having an effect. Prime Minister al-\nJafari said, ``The victory for Iraq is that Iraqis are voting.''\n  Third, the Iraqi security forces provided protection to more than \n6,000 polling sites. I cannot overstate the importance of that. The \nUnited States, together with its coalition partners, worked hard for \nsome 2 years now to establish a military and a police force. I would \nsay, having followed this very carefully in the Armed Services \nCommittee, that significant progress has been made in the last 120 \ndays. We have established criteria to assess the quality and the \nprofessional level attained by these individuals, and how best to \nintegrate them in the overall security framework needed to preserve and \nprotect the Iraqi people and preserve their sovereignty. Real progress \nhas been made. The voting day was an example of how they perform. At \nthe polling sites, security was primarily the responsibility of either \nthe Iraqi police or the national forces. It was clear and visible that \nthe Iraqis took the lead in this effort. No security incident appeared \nto affect voting. The level of security breaches was far below the high \nof some 300 breaches during the January election of this year. I \nbelieve there was less than 20 incidents total that tried to disrupt \nthe election, but all failed to affect the casting of votes at these \npolling places.\n\n  We have no confirmed figures on the results yet. We, the world, await \nthe outcome. Newspapers throughout the world carry reports of the \nimportance of the election and saluting those who made it possible--not \njust the security forces but also the United Nations and other \ninternational organizations which came in and supervised this historic \nday. Basically the streets were calm. In some places there were mild \ncelebrations.\n  Last month, for example, in Tall Afar in northern Iraq, coalition and \nIraqi forces were engaged with insurgents for control of that city--a \nbitter battle. It is interesting that on Saturday the Independent \nElection Committee of Iraq estimated that 80 percent of the registered \nvoters in that community\n\n[[Page S11512]]\n\nvoted. Therefore we must praise the efforts of the Iraqis, the U.S. \ncivilian and military personnel, all those of our coalition partners \nand those of international organizations for planning and executing an \nelectoral referendum in such a challenging environment. The United \nNations chief electoral adviser in Iraq said:\n\n       The process has gone so smoothly and well, from a technical \n     point of view.\n\n  The Vice Chairman of the International Mission for Iraqi Elections, a \ncoalition of electoral monitoring bodies, praised the referendum for \nits legal framework, planning, and logistics. Now the world will await \nthe final result, due hopefully later this week. The Independent \nElectoral Commission in Iraq is supervising this process and will \nannounce an official tally after votes are counted at a central \nlocation overseen by the United Nations election advisory team to \nensure that international standards are being met.\n  There are, no doubt, difficult days remaining ahead. Generals Abizaid \nand Casey told the Congress, the American people, and indeed the whole \nworld, just that in appearances throughout the United States last \nmonth. Both men were confident that we are moving in the right \ndirection. We saw that progress this Saturday and we salute them for \ntheir leadership and their participation and their responsibility in \nachieving the results that came about on Saturday.\n  If the constitution is ratified, Iraqis will vote again on December \n15. This time they will vote for a permanent government to take office \non December 31. That leaves 60 days, basically, between now and \nDecember 15. It will be a very unusual period in the history of Iraq, \nin that many of those in this current government, the interim \ngovernment, will be seeking office in that election. So we have to \nexercise a degree of patience as we watch them, as they pursue their \npolitical campaigns at the same time they have official duties to \nmaintain a government and serve the needs of the people of Iraq--\nwhether it is the power, whether it is the water, whether it is the \nsecurity. All of those things must be maintained during this \ninterregnum until the election takes place.\n  Then, following December 15 there is basically a 60-day period as \nestablished under the law that they have adopted. There is a 60-day \nperiod in which that government must replace the existing one and take \nthe reins of authority and govern Iraq for a period of 4 years--truly a \npermanent government.\n  As this political situation matures, so too will the Iraqi security \nforces, and I am confident we will see a continued strong pace to \nobtain the needed numbers of trained police, border security, internal \nsecurity, national guard, and a standing army to provide that nation \nwith protection for its sovereignty and internal protection from the \ninsurgents. With an Iraqi permanent government in place and steady \nprogress in these security forces, I see--and I want to say with great \ncaution--an opportunity, following the first of the year, to begin to \nreview our present force structure and to consider such options as will \nhopefully be available to lessen the size of our overall troop \npresence.\n  Watching Iraqis vote, we as Americans should be especially proud of \nthe contributions of those men and women who proudly wear the uniform \nof the United States. When I speak with them in Iraq, as I did weeks go \non my sixth trip, and in Afghanistan, they know the importance of what \nthey are doing.\n  I would like to underline that. Individually, they know and \nunderstand the importance of the mission which they, as members of the \nall-volunteer force of our military, have undertaken. Together with the \ncommitments in support of their families back home, they are performing \nbrilliantly in Iraq, Afghanistan, and all across the world, protecting \nthe security of this Nation and the security of our principal allies.\n  We will continue to demand from these people as we always have, but \nthey are like generations before them, answering a call to duty to \ndefend the values and freedoms we cherish. We wish them well. We wish \nthe blessings of the Almighty on them and their families. We have taken \nheavy casualties in this conflict, both in terms of lost lives and \nwounded. Not a day goes by that those who are privileged to serve in \nthis Chamber do not have that foremost in their minds, as do most \nAmericans.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Journal clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: Limits the availability of funds under this Act for use in \n                 paying for eminent domain activities)\n\n       Insert the following on page 348, after line 5, and \n     renumber accordingly:\n       ``Sec. 321. No funds in this Act may be used to support any \n     federal, state, or local projects that seek to use the power \n     of eminent domain, unless eminent domain is employed only for \n     a public use: Provided, That for purposes of this section, \n     public use shall not be construed to include economic \n     development that primarily benefits private entities: \n     Provided further, That any use of funds for mass transit, \n     railroad, airport, seaport or highway projects as well as \n     utility projects which benefit or serve the general public \n     (including energy-related, communication-related, water-\n     related and wastewater-related infrastructure), other \n     structures designated for use by the general public or which \n     have other common-carrier or public-utility functions that \n     serve the general public and are subject to regulation and \n     oversight by the government, and projects for the removal of \n     blight (including areas identified by units of local \n     government for recovery from natural disasters) or \n     brownfields as defined in the Small Business Liability Relief \n     and Brownfields Revitalization Act (Pub.

Mr. President, there has been much discussion with many \nMembers who are interested in this. I am filing it now, and I will ask \nunanimous consent that others who wish to be added as original \ncosponsors add their names. But I wanted to get it here on the floor so \neverybody could have a chance to look at it. We will shortly set it \naside because I think we are perhaps ready to go forward with the \nminimum wage amendments.\n  At this point, permit me to explain what the amendment is about.\n  This amendment is in response to the U.S. Supreme Court case, Kelo, \net al. v. City of New London, et al., in which the Court upheld by a 5-\nto-4 majority decision the use of eminent domain by the city of New \nLondon, CT. The Court noted that New London utilized a comprehensive \nplan that seeks to revitalize the city by using the land occupied by \nsome 115 privately owned properties as well as 32 acres of land \nformally occupied by a naval facility to accommodate a $300 million \nPfizer research facility, a waterfront conference hotel, a ``small \nurban village,'' as well as 80 new residences. The opinion seems to \nrely on ``affording legislatures broad latitude in determining what \npublic needs justify the use of the takings power.''\n  The opinion also notes that nothing precludes any State from placing \nfurther restrictions on its exercise of the takings power.\n  As discussed by the four-Justice dissenting opinion, this majority \nopinion goes much farther than the facts of the case and would \nessentially allow the use of eminent domain in virtually any \ncircumstance where the locality believes some benefit could be derived.\n  In particular, the four-Justice dissenting opinion concludes that \n``under the banner of economic development, all private property is now \nvulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner so \nlong as it might be upgraded--i.e., given to a owner who will use it in \na way that the legislature deems more beneficial to the public--in the \nprocess.''\n  There are a number of problems that have already been raised in the \neminent domain field. I say none are more striking than the proposal by \na developer to condemn the land on which the home of one of the \nJustices in the majority opinion sits to put a new hotel and the Lost \nFreedom Bar on his property.\n  In my State of Missouri, we have seen the use of eminent domain for a \nprivate purpose having tremendously harmful impacts in the Sunset Hills \ncommunity in St. Louis County. Eminent domain was used by a private \ndeveloper to condemn a large number of homes, forcing the residents out \nof their homes. The residents, in expectation of being forced out of \ntheir homes, purchased other houses. They began to move into other \nhouses. The private developer went broke. Now these people are stuck \nwith two mortgages, and the place they left is being declared a \nblighted area because everybody has left.\n  This has had a double impact, not only on the homeowners who were \nforced to take out a second mortgage but on a community which now is \nblighted, and some enterprising developers are seeking tax subsidies \nand other help to renovate a blighted property.\n  I believe most of us--and certainly the people I listen to in my home \nState of Missouri--believe this is absolutely wrong.\n  When you look at the New London case, you see how a tragic result can \noccur under the Kelo decision if legislatures do not act. The Governor \nof Missouri has called for a task force to study eminent domain.\n  I believe we have responsibility here to make sure that Federal funds \nare not used in the taking of property for a private use and utilizing \nFederal funds to bolster that effort.\n  In the Kelo case, the dissenting opinion notes that the petitioners \nare nine resident or investment owners of 15 homes in one of the \nneighborhoods subject to eminent domain. One of the petitioners lived \nin the house that has been in her family for over 100 years. She was \nborn in the house in 1918. Her husband has lived there since their \nmarriage in 1946, and their petitioner son lives next door with his \nfamily. Moreover, the record makes no claim that these are anything but \nwell-maintained houses that do not pose any source of social harm, \nunlike the circumstances of several earlier cases cited in the majority \nopinion.\n\n  The opinion warns that despite the majority opinion's reliance on the \ncity's comprehensive plan, there is nothing in the majority opinion \nthat prohibits property transfers generated with less care, that are \nless comprehensive, that happen to result from a less elaborate \nprocess, where the only projected advantage is the incidence of higher \ntaxes or the hope to transform an already prosperous city into an even \nmore prosperous one.\n  Despite my misgivings about the Kelo case and its implications, this \namendment today is very narrow and merely limits the availability of \nFederal funds from within this act for the year for which it is \napplicable for use in funding eminent domain activities. The key issue \nin this amendment is that these funds should not be used to provide \nFederal support for eminent domain activities that primarily benefit \nprivate entities. The amendment recognizes the importance of supporting \neminent domain activities in support of transportation projects, \nutility projects, and projects to remedy blight. Funds may still be \nused from the Federal sources in this act for these projects.\n  Moreover, the amendment requires the GAO to conduct a study that \nanalyzes the use of eminent domain throughout the Nation, as well as \nthe results accomplished by these uses of eminent domain.\n  I know some of my colleagues are proposing significant substantive \nauthorizing legislation which would have a much broader band. This \nobjective is worthwhile. I hope to join them at a later stage. This is \njust a starting step. It is a starting point to make sure eminent \ndomain for private purposes is not funded in the coming year from funds \nfrom the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, and related agencies bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this amendment. It \nestablishes a very important principle. I hope to have a very solid \nvote for this amendment when it comes to the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for offering this \namendment. The Kelo v. New London decision by the Supreme Court came as \na great shock to many. The amendment being offered seeks to impose some \nmeaningful limitations on the potential use of eminent domain with the \nfunds provided in this act. I emphasize this provision is limited to \nthe funds in this act and does not seek to overturn the Kelo decision. \nIt merely ensures that funds appropriated for 2006 for the Department \nof Transportation and Housing are not to use eminent domain for \nprojects that primarily benefit private interests.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the chairman \nof the committee for offering this critical amendment at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nWashington. There are other amendments that are going to be offered, \nand at the appropriate time I will ask this be set aside so further \namendments can be offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2078\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I intend to offer two amendments to this \nlegislation. I take a moment now to offer the first of those \namendments. While I do that, I thank my colleague from Missouri and my \ncolleague from the State of Washington for their work on this piece of \nlegislation. This is an appropriations subcommittee bill on which they \nhave done an excellent job. I appreciate that.\n\n[[Page S11514]]\n\n  I will offer an amendment at the completion of my comments. The \namendment deals with the issue of contracting, particularly contracting \nin Iraq, and also now contracting in this country for reconstruction of \nthe Gulf States that were hit so hard by Hurricane Katrina and then \nRita. I will talk about the reason I am offering this and point out I \nhave offered it previously, and I lost in the vote that was conducted \nin the Senate. However, I have previously indicated I do not intend to \nbe discouraged by losing a vote. I will ask the Congress to reconsider \nby having another vote, and I will do it again following this if I am \nnot successful.\n  Let me describe the circumstances that bring me to the conclusion we \nneed a special committee of the type that Harry S. Truman led when he \nwas a Senator. Incidentally, he was a Democrat Senator who had the \nSenate establish what was called the Truman Committee to investigate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse in defense spending back in the middle of what \nbecame World War II, the middle of the Second World War. With a \nDemocrat President, a Democrat Senator was doing investigative hearings \nabout waste, fraud, and abuse with respect to spending in the area of \ndefense. He uncovered billions and billions and billions of dollars of \nwaste. Good for him. I am sure it was not pleasant for the White House \nbecause Senator Truman was a member of the party of the President at \nthat point. Nonetheless, he did what he believed was important and \nright for this country. It was very important to have done.\n  These days we have something happening with respect to the country of \nIraq. We have a war in Iraq. We also have reconstruction programs for \nthe country of Iraq paid for by the American taxpayers. We have \ncontracts that are sole-source, no-bid contracts given to some very \nlarge corporations. We have tales of horror about the waste of the \ntaxpayers' money, and nobody seems to care very much.\n  We also now have similar tales with respect to contracting--again, \nno-bid, sole-source contracting--with respect to the reconstruction and \nthe response to Hurricane Katrina and Rita.\n  Let me describe just a few of these, if I might. First, let me talk \nabout contracting in Iraq. We have a substantial amount of contracting \nin Iraq, no-bid contracts, that are worth billions of dollars. I have \nheld six or seven hearings on this subject. It ranges from the small, a \nfellow holding up a towel, a hand towel, because he worked for \nHalliburton Corporation, which was suppose to buy towels for our troops \nin Iraq. He holds up a hand towel and says: I was the purchasing agent \nand was supposed to buy towels for the troops. But the company wanted \ntheir logo imprinted on the towels, which nearly doubled the price.\n  So the American taxpayer paid twice the price, or nearly twice the \nprice, for these towels because the company wanted the logo on the \ntowel.\n  He said they were paying $7,500 a month lease on SUVs in Iraq; \n$85,000 brand new trucks were left by the side of the road because they \nhad a flat tire and torched; $85,000 trucks discontinued to be used and \nleft by the side of the road because they had a plugged fuel pump, and \ntherefore torched. These purchasing agents were told it didn't matter, \nthese are cost-plus contracts. It does not matter that money is wasted, \nthey could spend what they wanted to spend. They were told the good old \nAmerican taxpayer will pick up the tab.\n  We had a man named Rory in charge of food service, a supervisor at a \nfood service area in Iraq. Rory described what his instructions were \nfrom Halliburton. His instructions were: If a government auditor comes \nby, you get out of there. You refuse to talk to a government auditor. \nIf you talk to an auditor that comes by to try to evaluate what is \ngoing on, one of two things will happen to you. You will either be \nfired, or you will be moved to an area in Iraq that is under active \nhostile action. Those are your choices.\n  Rory decided to tell what was going on. He said they were feeding \nsoldiers who did not exist. We have read the headlines, charging for \n42,000 soldiers to be fed every day; 42,000 meals, three times a day. \nIt turns out there are only 14,000 soldiers. A big error? Maybe. Rory \nsays it was happening in his area, about 4,000 or 5,000 soldiers in his \narea. He said: By the way, we had expired food. The date stamp had long \nsince expired, and we were told by the supervisors, it does not matter, \njust feed the food to the troops. Convoys come through in hostile \naction, with lead in the meat and lead in the food in the back of the \ntruck, and they were told to separate out the lead from the food, and \nby the way, for the bullets, give them to the supervisors as souvenirs \nand feed the food to the troops.\n  That is on the record from a guy who worked there, came back to the \ncountry, and became a whistleblower. He says here is what is going on. \nWe are being stolen blind.\n  Let me show a picture of another fellow who testified at a hearing I \nheld. Incidentally, I am doing the hearings not because I enjoy holding \nhearings. We are holding hearings because there is no oversight in the \nCongress. My intention is not to embarrass anybody but to represent the \ntaxpayer.\n  This represents hundred-dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. This \nfellow testified at a hearing I held. He said: In our area, we wrapped \nup hundred-dollar bills like this in Saran Wrap and told contractors--\nthis is contracting in Iraq--bring a bag because we pay in cash. If we \nowe you some money, bring a bag, we pay in cash. He said they actually \nplayed football in this office by passing back and forth these batches \nof hundred-dollar bills wrapped in Saran Wrap. He said it was like the \nOld West. Just bring a bag; if we owe you money, we fill it with cash.\n  When we hear these stories--and we pass emergency legislation for \nnearly $20 billion for reconstruction of Iraq; we spend $4 billion, $5 \nbillion, or $6 billion a month now in Iraq and Afghanistan--we push a \nmassive amount of money out there with some of it, a fair amount of it, \ngoing, particularly in the reconstruction, to no-bid contracts, to big \ncompanies, and then we hear stories such as, OK, here is the task: We \nwill put air conditioning in this building. So the big company gets \nmoney for air conditioning, subcontracts it, the subcontractor \ncontracts it, and when the work is all done you have ceiling fans--and \nwe paid for air conditioners. Who cares? Who is watching over this \nmassive amount of waste, fraud, and abuse? I will not go through it \nall, but it is unbelievable what is going on. Nobody seems to care.\n  What is happening with respect to reconstruction down in the gulf as \na result of Hurricane Katrina and Rita? We hear people talking about \n$200 billion. This Congress has appropriated slightly more than $60 \nbillion already. We have seen, once again, some of the same companies \nperforming no-bid contracts in Iraq now with no-bid contracts in the \ngulf.\n  First, we start with waste, fraud, and abuse with FEMA, an \norganization that used to be something really special. I remember when \nmy colleague, Fritz Hollings, sat in the chair behind me. Fritz \nHollings, back in another era, said: We had two natural disasters down \nin our part of the country. The first disaster was a hurricane; the \nsecond disaster was FEMA.\n  But then FEMA changed. All of a sudden James Lee Witt came in from a \nbackground that was unusual. The guy had experience. He came from a \nbackground of disaster preparedness, disaster emergency services. And \nall of a sudden, FEMA became something very special.\n  I know that because my State had a community of 50,000 in the flood \nof 1997 in Grand Forks, ND, that required the evacuation of almost an \nentire city. It was a massive evacuation and flood response. Guess who \nwas there at the lead. FEMA. Everybody there would say: What a \nremarkable organization. It worked. It knew what it was doing. It was \nsharp, on the ball, had plans, and it made things happen.\n  Now what has happened to FEMA? Let me describe it. I will not go into \ngreat length about FEMA because everybody knows some of the top \npositions of FEMA were filled with cronies who had no experience at all \nin disaster preparedness or emergency services and that then it was \nsubsumed into the Homeland Security Department. I do not need to go \ninto great length about that.\n  As shown in this picture, this is a truckdriver. We had a hearing the \nother day and he testified. This truckdriver, by the way, was \ncontracted for by a company that was doing work for FEMA. He was asked \nto haul ice. You\n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\ncan see all these trucks in the picture. There were hundreds of trucks \nwhere he was sitting. He was asked to haul ice to the victims of \nHurricane Katrina.\n  He picked up a load of ice with his 18-wheeler in New York, and away \nhe went. They said: We want you to go to Carthage, MO, so he drove his \n18-wheel truck, with a refrigerated trailer, to Carthage, MO. He got \nthere, and they said: Well, but now you need to go to Maxwell Air Force \nBase in Alabama. He said: Well, it would have been good to know that \nwhen I left New York. I would have saved about 700 miles. But that was \nthe way it was, so he headed off with his truck to Maxwell Air Force \nBase, AL.\n  He got to Alabama with a load of ice, and was parked at the Air Force \nbase with many others, hundreds of other trucks, we are told, that had \nfood, blankets, clothing, ice--all the things the victims of Hurricanes \nKatrina and Rita were begging for on television. He was sitting there, \nwatching the little television in his truck, hearing the victims of \nthese hurricanes describing what their needs were--and the needs were \nin the back of these trucks.\n  He sat there 12 days--12 days--and he finally went up to them and \nsaid: What is going on? They said: We have changed our mind. We want \nyou to drive your truck with ice to Idaho. He said: I didn't know there \nwas a hurricane in Idaho, and I don't intend to haul this ice to Idaho. \nThey said to him: You have a bad attitude. We are thinking of having \nthe National Guard escort you off this base.\n  It cannot be funny because it is so unbelievably inept. But about 2 \nhours after they told him that, they said: OK, we have changed our \nmind; you won't go to Idaho. You haul this ice to Massachusetts. This \nis like that television program, ``Where in the World is Carmen San \nDiego?'' If I had a map, I would show you where these ice cubes went. \nTo help the victims of the hurricane, directed apparently by FEMA and \nits contractor, they went from New York City, to Carthage, MO, to \nMaxwell Air Force Base, AL, to storage, now being paid for by the U.S. \nGovernment, in Massachusetts.\n  We paid $15,000 for this one truck to haul ice cubes between New York \nand Massachusetts--destined for victims of the hurricane. What \nunbelievable--unbelievable--ineptness by a Federal agency. This \ntruckdriver could have run FEMA better than that.\n  When he testified, he said: It would have been easy. All they would \nhave had to have is some sort of transportation system by which \neverybody calls in there and then you are directed. No such thing.\n  He finally said to them, as he sat 12 days on the base before they \nsent him to Massachusetts with his ice cubes: I'll tell you what I'll \ndo; I will pay for the ice cubes in my truck. I will pay you $1,500. \nThey said: What are you going to do with them? He said: I'm going to \nhaul them to Biloxi, MS, and give them away to victims who want them. \nThey said: Who is going to sign for them? He said: It shouldn't matter \nto you. Once I have paid for them, you're out of the picture. They \nsaid: We can't do that. You haul them up to Massachusetts. We are going \nto store them.\n  I told this story and somebody, the other day, said: Yeah. That's \njust one trucker. Oh, yeah, don't let the facts get in the way of good \ntheories, right? This is one trucker, but he said there were hundreds \nof truckers in exactly the same situation.\n  This was chaotic bungling. And who gets paid for this? Well, I assume \nthe contractor FEMA had who directed these truckers to haul ice cubes \nfrom New York to Massachusetts or, incidentally, a trucker who hauls \nice cubes from Canada down to Maxwell Air Force Base and back to \nCanada. What unbelievable waste.\n  So now here is the second piece of all of this and why there needs to \nbe investigations. This is a dormitory, by the way, as shown in this \npicture. It does not look much like a dormitory. It looks like a bunch \nof two-by-fours with blankets on top. This picture was taken last \nSaturday in Louisiana.\n  These people are not from Louisiana. These people were brought in to \nreplace some people from Louisiana who had jobs--qualified electricians \nwho had jobs--to begin doing some work under a contract. Those workers \nfrom Louisiana are displaced now by workers, most of whom, \nincidentally, are expected to be undocumented workers, who will come in \nand work for a fraction of the wage you would pay the people from \nLouisiana who need the jobs.\n  Why? Because Davis-Bacon is waived. What is Davis-Bacon? It is a \nforeign language to a lot of people, perhaps. The Davis-Bacon \nprovision, in law for some long while, says when you are going to have \nthe Federal Government come in and do contracting work, the Federal \nGovernment must pay the prevailing wage. The contractors who work for \nthe Federal Government must pay the prevailing wage. They cannot try \nand ratchet up a contract for themselves by abusing their workers and \ndeciding to pay them a tenth or a half of what they should be paid. You \nhave to pay the prevailing wage.\n  Well, the minute that happened in this area, the people who had the \njobs these people now have--the people, by the way, who were from \nLouisiana, skilled electricians, who needed the work in the shadow of \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita--lost their jobs. The foreman who was on \nthe jobsite with them was here and talked to me about it. They lost \ntheir jobs because they were replaced by these folks: largely \nundocumented workers willing to work for a fraction of the cost--not \nfrom Louisiana. The folks from Louisiana who had those jobs lost them \nwith reconstruction. That is what is happening.\n  My point is this: There needs to be some investigation. I am not \nsuggesting that it is an investigation to tarnish anybody. It is an \ninvestigation to evaluate what on Earth is wrong with the oversight for \nthis waste and fraud and corruption that exists in these contracts.\n  In the newspaper this morning, in the Style section, there is a \npicture of a woman named Bunny Greenhouse, who was the highest ranking \nofficial in the Corps of Engineers in the U.S. Government working in \nthe Pentagon. She lost her job. What a remarkable woman. She has three \nmasters degrees.\n\n  As an aside, I did not know this, but the story says she comes from a \ndirt-poor background. Her parents were uneducated. Her sister became a \nprofessor. Her brother, incidentally, scored 27,000 points in the \nNational Basketball Association, and was rated one of the 50 best \nbasketball players to ever play the game--Elvin Hayes.\n  Bunny Greenhouse, this woman, rose to become the highest ranking \ncivilian official in the Corps of Engineers. She just lost her job. Do \nyou know why? All of her references, all of her evaluations were \noutstanding--outstanding. What a terrific person--until she started \ntelling the ``old boys network'': You can't do what you are doing here. \nYou can't give Halliburton big no-bid contracts and even have them \nsitting in on the meetings about the scope of the work. You cannot do \nthat. It violates all of the rules and procedures. The minute she \nstarted interrupting the little playground that exists with these \nfavorite no-bid contracts, all of a sudden she was persona non grata.\n  You can read the story in this morning's Washington Post. She has \nbeen here twice to talk to us on Capitol Hill. Not many seem to care \nabout that. But it is a symptom of something much more than her; it is \na symptom of a culture about corruption, about waste, and, yes, fraud. \nIf you wonder whether that is justified, I will be happy to give you, \nand anyone in the Senate who wants, the written testimony of a good \nmany witnesses who have testified on these very issues.\n  So my proposition is simple. My proposition is Congress should \nestablish a type of Truman committee. I describe it as a Truman \ncommittee because we have done it before--a special committee that \ntakes a hard look at all of this contracting that is going on and tries \nto shut down the waste, fraud, and abuse the taxpayers in this country \nshould not have to be accepting and this Congress should not allow. \nThis committee would not be necessary if we had aggressive oversight \ncommittees.\n  Let me say that the chairman from Missouri and the ranking member \nfrom the State of Washington--this is an appropriations committee. I \njust described the job they have done. They have done a great job. This \namendment has nothing to do with them. They are good appropriators. I \nam proud of their work. This appropriations subcommittee, is awfully \ngood, and I am\n\n[[Page S11516]]\n\nhere to support the subcommittee work. So my amendment does not have \nanything to do with them.\n  But I would say this: Almost everyone who watches this Congress work \nunderstands there is virtually no oversight and no accountability after \nwe do appropriate that money. The American taxpayers deserve better \nthan that. We have had a previous vote, and we had more than a majority \nof the Members of the Senate say no, they do not want to have anything \nto do with a special committee to take a look at investigating this \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. I hope others will change their mind. This is \nnot about Democrats and Republicans; it is about protecting the \nAmerican taxpayers. And it is about making sure we root out the waste, \nfraud, and abuse that exists in these sole-source contracts. What is \nhappening is almost unbelievable to me. Yet this Senate seems nearly \nasleep on these issues.\n  Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2078 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2078.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Tuesday, October 18, 2005, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make the point that this amendment \ndiffers from one we have considered previously in that the scope of the \nevaluation and investigation of expenditures and contracting would \ninclude not just with respect to Iraq but also the contracting and \nreconstruction in the gulf in relation to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \ndamages.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for bringing this \nforward. As I mentioned, this is an appropriations bill. It is a very \nimportant subject he has raised, but I raise a point of order under \nrule XVI that this is legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to rule V, I have offered proper \nnotice to suspend the rules. My expectation would be we would have a \nvote on suspension of the rules. As the Senator knows, I referenced \nthat in the Senate Journal last evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to suspend is debatable.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this measure be \nset aside so we can work out a time for a vote on the measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I, in fact, will agree to a time agreement \nat some point. I have no intention of extending debate. I do want to \nmake some additional comments at some point when we set up a vote, but \nI understand there are others who wish to offer an amendment, so I will \nbe happy to allow this to be set aside, after which I will consult with \nthe Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Washington about a time \nfor the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I believe there are \nsome on this side who will want to respond. I hope we can get a tight \ntimeframe because we are going to be very busy this week. We have to \nfinish this measure.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2113\n\n  Mr. President, now, since it appears we are going to be having some \naction today, I ask unanimous consent that we bring up the amendment \nfiled this morning, amendment No. 2113. I believe it can be adopted by \na voice vote, with Senators who wish to speak on it permitted to speak \nduring time later on today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is pending.\n  Is there further debate? If not, the question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2113) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues and I look forward to \naction on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor on the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2115\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2115.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with, since copies have been given to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senator Kennedy that would increase the Federal minimum \nwage. I have offered an amendment myself. Although both of the \namendments would raise the minimum wage by the same amount, $1.10 over \n18 months, only my amendment recognizes the enormous burden mandates \nsuch as this one have on American's small business and works to \nalleviate that. We probably ought to be in agreement on this since the \nnumbers are the same. All I do is add some things that will offset \nthose burdens that have been placed with the minimum wage.\n  When Senator Kennedy offered his original amendment, he referred to \nits economic effect as ``a drop in the bucket in the national \npayroll.'' A drop in the bucket in the national payroll? Comments like \nthis are precisely why small business owners across the Nation feel \nthat Washington, DC, politicians do not understand their needs.\n  We must also bear in mind that these are the people who create jobs, \nwho provide an increasing percentage of employment for all workers, \nincluding those with minimum skills. It is usually the small business \nthat takes a person who has minimum skills and trains them to a higher \nlevel. Quite often, they train them to a higher level where they even \nstart their own business or they go to work for somebody else, taking \nthe skills from where they are to an even higher level.\n  A lot of the problem with employment in the United States is that we \ndon't have the people in the right places for the employment. They \ncould be making more at what they are doing if they were in a different \nplace. But sometimes they are not willing to move. They need more \ntraining, too. We have provisions for more training.\n  I would like to mention a little facility we have in Casper, WY, that \nwill train people to work on oil rigs, and placement is 100 percent. \nThe minimum is $16, and depending on what part of it you do, how long \nyou are there, and what other skills you pick up, it goes considerably \nhigher than that.\n  The mines in Campbell County, WY, are looking for additional \nemployees. There are some requirements. You have to have a clean drug \nrecord. You have to be able to pass a drug test because when you are \nworking around heavy equipment, if you don't have all of your \ncapacities, you can hurt people, including yourself. That should not \nhappen. So they do have requirements about having to have drug tests. \nBut if you can pass the drug test, they will train you for the heavy \nequipment you need to operate in the mine. We are talking $50,000, \n$60,000, $70,000 without overtime, and then you have the right on both \nof those to have overtime as well, probably to the extent of whatever \nyou are willing to put in and the law allows. There are some \nconstraints on it since you are handling heavy equipment, but those are \nalso nontraditional jobs.\n  We had a marvelous hearing in the HELP Committee. We had a person\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\nfrom New York City. The young lady was talking about the training she \nhad received in nontraditional jobs and the way her wages had \nincreased. Quite frankly, at the present time she makes more than a \nU.S. Senator. What she is doing is putting rock trim on skyscrapers in \nNew York. But there are some tremendous things out there, if a person \ngets the opportunity and takes the opportunity to increase their \nskills. If you are a minimum-skill person, if you are just doing the \njob and getting by and not learning anything, you are going to get \nminimum-skill wages.\n  I mentioned just getting by, just putting in the time. There is a \ndifference. I know when my dad was interviewing people for the shoe \nbusiness, he sometimes said, after he had interviewed them: That person \ntold me they had 5 years' experience. I asked them a few questions, and \nwhat they had is 1 month's experience 60 times because they never \nlearned anything from the first day they were on the job. They didn't \nhave basic skills. He believed in training people and making sure they \nhad, in 5 years, actually 5 years' worth experience. I can guarantee \nyou, after the very first short training time, they never had minimum \nwage. But it is tied to the skills.\n  So to suggest that this is a drop in the bucket in the national \npayroll is a little bit offensive and does not recognize the job that \nsmall business is doing at getting people into the workforce and \nactually training them. It is particularly offensive to employers to \nsuggest that a 41-percent increase in their labor cost, which is what \nis being proposed at this time, amounts to a drop in the bucket. A 41-\npercent increase in labor costs forces a small businessperson to face \nchoices such as whether to increase prices, which often is not a \nchoice, or face a potential loss of customers from lack of service or \nwhether to reduce spending on health insurance coverage or other \nbenefits to employees or to terminate employees. These choices are far \nmore significant than a drop in the bucket, particularly if you are the \nemployee who got terminated. It is a 100-percent problem to you.\n  Apart from its failure to mitigate the cost of this mandate for small \nbusinesses, the Kennedy amendment also fails to address the root of the \nproblem for our lowest paid workers. I have touched on that a little \nbit. Congress, by simply imposing an artificial wage increase, will not \nmeaningfully address the real issues of our lowest paid workers. \nRegardless of the size of any wage increase Congress might impose, the \nreality is that yesterday's lowest paid worker, assuming he still has a \njob, will continue to be tomorrow's lowest paid worker as well. That is \nnot advancement. Advancement on the job and earned wage growth cannot \nbe legislated. We do a disservice to all concerned, most especially the \nchronic low wage worker, to suggest that a Federal wage mandate is the \nanswer.\n  What we need to focus on is not an artificially imposed number but on \nthe acquisition and improvement of job and job-related skills. In this \ncontext, we should recognize that only 68 percent of the students \nentering the ninth grade 4 years ago are expected to graduate this \nyear. And for minority students, that hovers right around 50 percent. \nIn addition, we continue to experience a dropout rate of 11 percent per \nyear. These noncompletions and dropout rates and the poor earnings \ncapacities that come with them can't be fixed by a Federal wage policy. \nWe have to get the kids to stay in school, to get the education. We \nhave to make sure the education is relevant and that when they graduate \nat whatever level, there is a job out there for them and that the job \nis transportable, that they can take their skills other places in the \ncountry, as those areas open up, with a higher wage for those skills, \nand that they have the knowledge to be able to learn, to continue to \nadvance their skills so that when they move, they get more.\n  What we want are the best jobs kept in America for the people who \nlive in America. That is an opportunity we have but not with an \nartificially mandated minimum wage. I would hope that nobody in the \nUnited States would work at the minimum wage. I know for a fact that \nmost of the people who start at minimum wage, if they pay attention to \ntheir job, are not in minimum wage very long. If they pick up the \nskills, they get paid for those skills. That is so that they don't go \nsomewhere else and work. But if they don't have the skills, they are \nlucky to get a job at all. I have people I have hired before who \ncouldn't read. What kind of opportunities do they have if they can't \nread? We have them in literacy programs. We moved them into GED \nprograms and trained them in something they could do and be proud of, \nand that is a higher wage.\n  We must keep this in mind. The phrase ``minimum wage worker'' is an \narbitrary designation. A more accurate description and one that should \nalways be at the center of the debate is that we are seeking to address \nthose workers who have few, if any, skills they need to compete for \nbetter jobs--that is what we are doing in the United States, \ncompeting--and then command higher wages. The effect may be low wages, \nbut the cause is low skills. In short, the problem is not the minimum \nwage, the problem is minimum skills.\n  If we are to approach this debate in a constructive and candid way, \nwe need to acknowledge certain basic principles of economics. Wages do \nnot cause sales. Sales are needed to provide revenue to pay wages. \nRevenue drives wages. Wages can cause productivity, but the \nproductivity has to come first to be able to afford the wages. When we \nraise the minimum wage, we are raising the price somehow. The people \nwho get the minimum wage have to buy stuff just like everybody else. If \nthe price goes up because a phony minimum wage went in, then their \nbuying ability did not increase at all. How pleased can you be if you \nget more money and you can't buy anything more? What we are trying to \ndo is set up a system where people will make more true wages and, with \nthe true wages, be able to purchase more than they could before. Some \nof that is basic need, but we are hoping they all get past the basic \nneed level and can get into the wants and desires as well, that they \ncan be part of the American dream.\n  Skills, however, operate differently than wages. Skills do create \nsales, and sales produce revenue. Skills do create productivity. Skills \nget compensated with higher wages or people find another job. The \nemployee simply goes elsewhere for higher wages. Wage increases without \nincreased sales or higher productivity have to be paid for with higher \nprices. Higher prices wipe out wage increases. Skills, not artificial \nwage increases, produce true net gains in income for the individual and \nfor the business. When it increases for the business, it increases \ntheir likelihood of keeping their job and getting to advance. The \nminimum wage should be for all workers what it is for most--a starting \npoint in an individual's lifelong working career, their lifelong \nlearning career. Those who advance in any jobs are the ones who look at \nit and say: How can I do this better? If they come up with a way to do \nit better, they will get more compensation. Their business will make \nmore money or they will go start their own business, which is also a \ndream of mine, to get people to do that. I hold an inventors conference \nevery year. The purpose of that conference is to get people to invent \nabout their surroundings and their jobs and to find some product that \nthey can make in Wyoming and ship around the world. I have found that \nanybody who has figured out a way to make a living in Wyoming lives in \nWyoming. We are a little short on jobs out there. That is why we only \nhave 494,612--that is last week's number--living in Wyoming. We hope to \nget past that half-million mark, but it does require jobs. The way to \nget jobs is to have the skills to be able to improve what you do.\n  The minimum wage should be for workers what it is for most; that is, \na starting point in an individual's lifelong working career, their \nlifelong learning time. Viewed as a starting point, it becomes clear \nthat the focus needs to be less on where an individual begins his or \nher working career. Instead, more emphasis should be placed on how an \nindividual can best progress. Real wage growth happens every day, and \nit is not a function of Government mandate. It is the direct result of \nan individual becoming more skilled and, therefore, more valuable to \nhis or her employer. As a former small business owner, I know that \nthese entry-level jobs are a gateway into the workforce for people \nwithout skills or experience.\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\nThese minimum-skill jobs can open the door to better jobs and better \nlives for low-skilled workers because they get more skills if we give \nthem the tools they need to succeed.\n  We have a great example in Cheyenne, WY, of minimum-skilled workers \nwho were given the tools and the opportunity to reach the American \ndream. Mr. Jack Price, who is the owner of 8 McDonald's in Wyoming--and \nwe use McDonald's as kind of a derogatory thing with people as being a \nminimum wage establishment; I assure you that people who start there, \nwho learn something, are not at the minimum wage very long--has had 3 \nemployees who started working at McDonald's at the minimum wage, and \nthose 3 employees now own a total of 20 restaurants. They learned \nsomething. They started at minimum wage. They didn't like it, I am \nsure. They learned. They got experience. They delved into it and found \nout all they could about the business and wound up owning the business. \nThat is what we want for people. It requires some individual \ninitiative, and it does require starting at the bottom. With almost \nevery job, you have to start at the bottom. If you learn it, you can \nprogress in it. Three employees at McDonald's who started at the \nminimum wage now own 20 restaurants.\n  It is a great success story. That is where I would like people to go. \nThis type of wage progression and success should be the norm for \nworkers across the country. However, there are some minimum-skilled \nworkers for whom stagnation at the lower tier wage is a longer term \nproposition.\n  The answer for these workers, however, is not to simply raise the \nlowest wage rung. Rather, these individuals must acquire the training \nand skills that result in meaningful and lasting wage growth. We must \nequip our workers with the skills they need to compete in technology-\ndriven global economies.\n  It is estimated that 60 percent of tomorrow's jobs will require \nskills that only 20 percent of today's workers possess. Let me say that \nagain. It is estimated that 60 percent of tomorrow's jobs will require \nskills that only 20 percent of today's workers possess.\n  Here is another interesting point. It is also estimated that the \ngraduating student will likely change careers some 14 times in their \nlife. There are a lot of people in America whose parents went to work \nfor one company, worked there 30 years and retired. I am talking about \na different world. It is estimated that the graduating students will \nlikely change careers some 14 times in their life.\n  Here is the part that is even more stunning, and I am not talking \nabout changing employers. I am talking about changing careers. Of those \n14 careers, 10 of them have not even been invented yet. We don't even \nknow what this change in technology is going to bring about, but we do \nknow that people better be able to change to get those jobs, and they \nare going to have to change pretty dramatically. It is going to be \nbased on the education they get and then the skills they acquire in the \nworkforce after they get out of school. School is never out; learning \nis never over.\n  To support these needs, we do need a system in place that can support \na lifetime of education, a lifetime of training and retraining for our \nworkers. The end result will be the attainment of skills that provide \nmeaningful wage growth and competition--successful competition--in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  As legislators, our efforts are better focused on ensuring that the \ntools and opportunities for training and enhancing skills over a \nworker's lifetime are available and fully utilized than they are on \nimposing an artificial wage increase that fails to address the real \nissues and, in the process, does more harm than good.\n  Skills and experience, not an artificial Federal wage hike, will lead \nto lasting wage security for American workers. We have to compete. It \nis an international competition. Skills count.\n  As chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \none of my priorities is reauthorizing and improving the Nation's job \ntraining system that was created by the Workforce Investment Act. This \nlaw will help provide American workers with the skills they need to \ncompete in the global economy. That will lead to real, not artificial, \nwage increases.\n  Last year, I was denied a conference committee being appointed to \nresolve the differences with the House on this important bill by the \nvery people proposing this increase. This year, we reported it out of \nthe HELP Committee by a unanimous voice vote again. It was unanimous \ncoming out of committee 2 years ago, it was unanimous passing the floor \nof this body, it was unanimous passing out of committee again this \nyear, and it is waiting to come to the floor. I am hoping we can get \nconsent to get it over to a conference committee with the House.\n  This bill will start an estimated 900,000 people a year on a better \ncareer path. You can't tell me that some of the same people who are \ndenied the opportunity in the last Congress now think a magic \nredetermination of the lowest wage for the lowest skills will change \npeople's lives.\n  Outside the glare of election year politics, I hope we can quickly \npass a job training bill that will truly improve the wages and lives of \nworkers in this country.\n  Let's be clear about what a minimum wage hike will and will not do. \nFirst, we must realize that large increases in the minimum wage will \nhurt low-income, low-skilled individuals. Mandated hikes in the minimum \nwage do not cure poverty, and they clearly do not create jobs. The \nCongressional Budget Office has said:\n\n       Most economists would agree that an increase in the minimum \n     wage rate would cause firms to employ fewer low-wage workers \n     or employ them for fewer hours.\n\n  That is a CBO estimate, October 18, 1999.\n  What every student who has ever taken an economics course knows is if \nyou increase the cost of something--in this case a minimum wage job--\nyou decrease the demand for those jobs. Misleading political rhetoric \ncannot change the basic principle of supply and demand. The majority of \neconomists continue to affirm the job-killing nature of mandated wage \nincreases. A recent poll concluded that 77 percent--that is nearly \n17,000 economists; that is scary, isn't it?--but 77 percent, nearly \n17,000 economists believe that a minimum wage hike causes job loss.\n  We simply cannot assume that a business that employs 50 minimum wage \nworkers before this wage increase is enacted will still employ 50 \nminimum wage workers afterwards. Whether a business is in Washington or \nWyoming, employers cannot absorb an increase in their costs without a \ncorresponding decrease in the number of jobs or benefits they can \nprovide workers. So we know there are losers when we raise the minimum \nwage, but who are the individuals who will benefit?\n  Minimum wage earners who support a family solely based on wage are \nactually few and far between. Fully 85 percent--85 percent--of the \nminimum wage earners live with their parents, have a working spouse or \nare living alone without children--85 percent; 41 percent live with a \nparent or relative; 23 percent are single or are the sole breadwinner \nin a house with no children; and 21 percent live with another wage \nearner.\n  Our research shows that poor targeting and other unintended \nconsequences of the minimum wage make it terribly ineffective at \nreducing poverty in America, the intended purpose of the policy. In \nfact, two Stanford University economists concluded that a minimum wage \nincrease is paid for by higher prices that hurt poor families the most.\n  A 2001 study conducted by Stanford University economists found that \nonly 1 in 4 of the poorest 20 percent of families would benefit from an \nincrease in the minimum wage. The way to improve--truly improve--the \nwages and salaries of these American workers is through education and \ntraining, not an artificial wage increase.\n  With these realities in mind, I am offering an amendment that \nrecognizes the true cost of a minimum wage increase on American workers \nand businesses, particularly small businesses. My amendment includes a \nminimum wage increase of $1.10, which is just like Senator Kennedy's \namendment right now. So we are really not talking about the minimum \nwage amount.\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\n  My amendment addresses other needs for reform and the needs of small \nbusinesses that create most of the jobs in this country. That is where \nthe two amendments differ. I have added some things beyond the $1.10 \nminimum wage increase, and that is to smooth out the bump a little bit \nfor these small businesses that are creating these jobs, that are \nproviding the training, that are helping people get better skills so \nthey can get better jobs.\n  So my amendment addresses other needs for reform and the needs of \nsmall businesses that create most of the jobs in this country. \nTherefore, my amendment is protective of economic growth and job \ncreation. I think if we had worked this out in committee, probably the \nother side would have accepted what I am about to do in additional \npieces to this bill, and a lot of this discussion would not have been \nnecessary.\n  Let me briefly review the provisions contained in my amendment. In \ndoing so, we must bear in mind that small businesses continue to be the \nengine of our economy and the greatest single source of job creation. \nAny wage increase that is imposed on small businesses poses \ndifficulties for that business, the owner, and his or her employees. I \nwill tell you, in small business, the employees recognize how tenuous \ntheir job is. There are not a whole lot of layers that can be laid off \nbefore they get to them because there is the owner and a couple of \nemployees. And because there are just a few in the business, they know \nhow the business operates. They know what the dollars coming in are and \nwhat the ability is to change that unless they can increase \nproductivity or sales.\n  Any wage increase that is imposed on small businesses poses \ndifficulties for that employer and his or her employees. My amendment \nrecognizes that reality and provides a necessary measure of relief for \nthose employers. My amendment would make the following changes that are \ncritical, particularly for small business.\n  First, we would update the small business exemption. Having owned a \nsmall business in Wyoming, I can speak from personal experience about \nhow difficult any minimum wage increase is for small business and job \ngrowth, particularly for the entry-level people during the first couple \nof months they are on the job.\n  Small businesses generate 70 percent of new jobs. Let me say that \nagain. Small businesses generate 70 percent of new jobs. Since a \nnegative impact of a minimum wage increase will affect small business \nmost directly, we have proposed addressing the small business threshold \nwhich is set under current law at half a million dollars. If the \noriginal small business threshold, which was enacted in the 1960s, were \nto be adjusted for inflation, it would be over $1.5 million.\n  The small business threshold was last updated 15 years ago. In those \nensuing years, the national minimum wage has been hiked, the economy \nhas undergone dramatic shifts, and the way work is done in this country \nhas changed forever. The pending amendment raises that threshold to $1 \nmillion to reflect those changes. It ought to be at $1.5 million. That \nis what inflation shows. But we are being reasonable. I like to be \nreasonable on any of the proposals I put forward. So instead of going \nfrom a half a million dollars to $1.5 million, this bill only raises it \nto $1 million to reflect part of those changes.\n  My amendment also incorporates bipartisan technical corrections that \nwere originally proposed in 1990 by then-Small Business Committee \nChairman Dale Bumpers, who used to serve on that side of the aisle when \nI was first here. It was cosponsored over the years by Senators Reid of \nNevada, Harkin, Pryor, Mikulski, Baucus, Kohl, and many others.\n  As those Senators can attest, the Department of Labor disregarded the \nwill of Congress and interpreted the existing small business threshold \nto have little or no meaning. The Labor Department would make a Federal \ncase out of the most trivial paperwork infraction by the smallest \nbusinesses because of what it interpreted as a loophole in the law. \nSome would say that the 1989 bill to hike the minimum wage and small \nbusiness threshold was unartfully drafted and permitted this result. \nOthers say the Department is misreading the clear language of the \nstatute.\n  Regardless, the fact is that a threshold enacted by Congress is not \nproviding the balance and fairness that was intended. This amendment \ncorrects that problem by stating clearly that the wage and overtime \nprovisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act apply to employees working \nfor enterprises engaged in commerce or engaged in the production of \ngoods for commerce. My amendment also applies those wage-and-hour \nworker safeguards to home work solutions.\n  The second change: ensuring procedural fairness for small business. \nThis next provision is commonsense, good Government legislation. \nSurely, we can all agree that small business owners, the individuals \nwho do the most to drive our economy forward, deserve a break the first \ntime they make an honest paperwork mistake when no one is hurt and the \nmistake is corrected.\n  Small business owners have told me over and over how hard they try to \ncomply with all the rules and regulations imposed on them, mostly by \nthe Federal Government. As a former owner of a small business myself, I \nknow what they mean. Yet for all that work, a Government inspector can \nfine a small business owner for paperwork violations alone, even if the \nbusiness has a completely spotless record and the employer immediately \ncorrects the unintentional mistake. Who is hurt? Nobody is hurt, but it \nis an extra burden on small business.\n  I have to tell you a little bit about small business. They don't have \na lot of employees. They don't have any specialists out there. Big \nbusiness can hire people to take a look at the paperwork, and small \nbusiness has to stay as lean and mean as they can to make a profit. \nLook at the difference between profits in your small businesses and \nyour big businesses, and you will see they are staying pretty lean and \nmean.\n  I remember the first hearing I held in Wyoming after I became a \nSenator was on small business issues.\n  One has to remember, Wyoming has kind of a small population. So I was \nthrilled when people from about 100 businesses showed up for this \nhearing.\n  Afterwards, one of the reporters came up to me and said: Were you not \nkind of disappointed in the turnout?\n  I said, no, I was not disappointed in the turnout. These are small \nbusinesses we are talking about, and if they had an extra person to \nspend half a day at a hearing, they would fire them, as they have, to \nstay mean and lean, to stay in business.\n  So there is a whole world of difference in trying to meet some of the \nFederal paperwork mandates that are fineable. They are hard enough to \nlearn about, so the first mistake that does not affect anybody and is \ncorrected immediately ought not to be a fine. Even the best intentioned \nemployer can get caught in the myriad of burdensome paperwork \nrequirements imposed on them by the Federal Government.\n  The owners of small businesses are not asking to be excused from the \nobligations or regulations, but they do believe they deserve a break if \nthey have previously complied perfectly with the law.\n  As Jack Gold, the owner of a small family business in New Jersey, \ntold Congress a few years ago at one of our hearings:\n\n       No matter how hard you try to make your business safe for \n     your employees, customers, neighbors and family members, in \n     the end, if a government inspector wants to get you, they can \n     get you. The government cannot tell me that they care more \n     for my family's safety and my company's reputation than I do.\n\n  When one has a small business, the people who work there are part of \na family. Small business men and women who are first-time violators of \npaperwork regulations deserve our protection.\n  The third change: Providing regulatory relief for small businesses. \nAs any increase in the minimum wage places burdens on small employers, \nit is only fair that we simultaneously address the ongoing problem of \nagencies not fully complying with congressional directives contained \nwithin the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act.\n  I will say that again: The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement \nFairness Act. The titles are long to read, let alone the bills that go \nwith them.\n  Under the law, agencies are required to publish small entity \ncompliance guides for those rules that require a\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\nregulatory flexibility analysis. Unfortunately, agencies have either \nignored this requirement, or when they tried to comply have not done so \nfully or carefully. Now, the previous issue I talked about was small \nbusinesses having a little imperfection in a regulation for the first \ntime and correcting it immediately. Now we are talking about the \nFederal Government having problems and ignoring requirements.\n  We do not have a penalty for that, but it is something to which the \nFederal agencies have to pay attention, and my amendment does this by \nincluding specific provisions that the Government Accounting Office has \nsuggested to improve the clarity of the requirements. People ought to \nbe able to read the rules and know what they say without having to hire \na specialist or a lawyer.\n  The fourth change: Removing the barriers to a flexible time \narrangement. My amendment includes legislation that could have a \nmonumental impact on the lives of thousands of working men, women, and \nfamilies in America. This legislation could give employees greater \nflexibility in meeting and balancing the demands of work and family. \nThe demand for family time is evident.\n  Let me give some of the latest statistics. Seventy percent of \nemployees do not think there is a healthy balance between their work \nand their personal life. Seventy percent of the employees say that \nfamily is their most important priority.\n  The family time provision in my amendment addresses these concerns \nhead on. It gives employees the option of flexing their schedules over \na 2-week period. In other words, employees would have 10 flexible hours \nthey could work in 1 week in order to take 10 hours off in the next \nweek.\n  We are not shifting pay periods or anything. We are making \narrangements that if the employer and the employee agree, there can be \na shift in their work schedule. Here is a really important part. \nFlexible work arrangements have been available in the Federal \nGovernment for over two decades. We are not asking for anything that \nthe Federal Government does not already allow for Federal employees.\n  I have to say, one of the problems and one of the reasons this came \nto my attention is that Cheyenne, WY--that is our biggest city in \nWyoming--has a little over 53,000 people. That is the capital. We have \na lot of Government workers there because it is the capital. The \nGovernment workers are allowed to take flextime.\n  The private businesses that are there are not allowed to give \nflextime. So we have one spouse who works for the Government who can \nshift their schedule around to take an afternoon off to go watch their \nchild play soccer in another town--and we have to drive some long \ndistances in Wyoming to get to the other towns to watch the soccer \ngames--but the other parent cannot because the other parent is working \nfor a private company.\n  Why would we discriminate that way? Why would we allow Government \nworkers to do some things that the private ones cannot do under the \nsame law?\n  Flexible work arrangements have been available in the Federal \nGovernment for over two decades. This program has been so successful \nthat in 1994 President Clinton issued an Executive order extending it \nto parts of the Federal Government that had not yet had the benefits of \nthe program. President Clinton then stated:\n\n       The broad use of flexible arrangements to enable Federal \n     employees to better balance their work and family \n     responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job \n     satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.\n\n  Now, why would we not want that to be in the private sector, too? I \nmean, the private sector ought to have broad use of flexible \narrangements to enable their employees to better balance their work and \nfamily responsibilities, which would increase employee effectiveness \nand job satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.\n  That sounds reasonable to me, that what we said the Government could \nbenefit from that the private sector could benefit from, too. Why are \nwe not allowing the private sector to do that?\n\n  I could not agree more with President Clinton, but we now need to go \nfurther and extend this privilege to private-sector workers. We know \nthis legislation is not a total solution. We know there are many other \nprovisions under the 65-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act that need our \nattention, but the flexible time provision is an important part of the \nsolution. It gives employees a choice, the same choice as Federal \nworkers.\n  I want to give a little bit of a summary on that flextime proposal \nbecause this is a key part of it. I have heard some flak before and, \nagain, I think if we were debating this in the committee situation and \nworking it out when we were not in front of the TV cameras that we \nwould probably come up with this as a reasonable solution. It would be \nincluded in a bill, and we would probably pass it through by unanimous \nconsent. But it gets mixed in with the minimum wage debate, and needs \nto be, so I want to make sure people understand this.\n  The flextime proposal would provide employees with the option of \nchoosing time paid off for working overtime hours through a voluntary \nagreement with their employer. It will do this by allowing them the \noption of flexing their schedule over a 2-week period. In other words, \nemployees would have up to 10 flexible hours they could work in 1 week \nin order to take paid time off during the following week.\n  I do not want anybody confusing this with a comp time provision that \nwas put in before. This does not include the comp time provision. So \nany accusations that this is taking overtime away from anybody, I would \ncontend, even under the comp time solution is not valid. Under a \nflextime proposal, it is not valid. Again, it is the same thing that we \ndecided that Federal employees could have, and if we would put any \nextra strain on a Federal employee I am sure that would be illegal \nunder wage and labor laws. So what we are proposing is the same thing \nas Federal workers.\n  Now, as I mentioned, this provision will allow them the option of \nflexing their schedules over a 2-week period, give them up to 10 \nflexible hours they could work in 1 week in order to take paid time off \nduring the following week. This program would be strictly voluntary. No \nemployer and no employee can be forced to enter into a flextime \nagreement. However, this legislation prohibits intimidation, threats, \nand coercion by the employers and would provide penalties for \nviolations of the prohibition. The flextime legislation will not take \naway anyone's right to overtime pay.\n  The authority to allow employees flextime also sunsets 5 years after \nenactment of the bill. I am that confident that it will be proven to be \na necessity for the employees, so much so that in all 50 States they \nwill be demanding that their Senator keep flextime for them. The only \nreason it is not being demanded in all 50 States at the present time is \nbecause there are a bunch of employees who have not heard about it. \nEmployees in Government areas such as Cheyenne, WY, have heard about it \nbecause, as I mentioned, one spouse has the right because they work for \nthe Government. The other spouse does not have the right because they \nwork for private business.\n  I have to say, both of those spouses are really upset that we have \nnot changed the law. We need to do that.\n  Sometimes there is some criticism of this so I have to repeat again \nthe flextime proposal does not affect the sanctity of the 40-hour week. \nThe 40-hour week remains the law. Under the flextime proposal an \nemployee would earn overtime in the very same way he or she currently \ndoes, by working more than 40 hours in the same 7-day period. This \nproposal does not impact any worker who prefers to receive monetary \novertime compensation. It will not require employees to take \ncompensatory time--I should say flextime. I do not even want that word \n``compensatory'' in there because I do not want any confusion, as has \nbeen stated previously. Previously, we have offered flextime and comp \ntime. This is a flextime proposal.\n  It will not require employees to take flextime, nor will it require \nemployers to offer it. The bill contains numerous safeguards to protect \nthe employee and to ensure the choice and selection of flextime. It is \ntruly voluntary on the part of the employee.\n  The proposal does not prevent an employee from changing his or her \nmind\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\nafter he or she chooses time off in lieu of monetary compensation. An \nemployee can choose at any time to cash out any and all time off. The \nemployer must make the payoff.\n  The fifth change I am making: extending the restaurant employee tip \ncredit. A major employer of entry-level workers is the food service \nindustry. The industry relies on what is known as the tip credit, which \nallows an employer to apply a portion of the employee's tip income \nagainst the employer's obligation to pay the minimum wage.\n  Currently, the Federal law requires a cash wage of at least $2.13 an \nhour for tipped employees, and it allows an employer to take a tip \ncredit of up to $3.02 of the current minimum wage. To protect tipped \nemployees, current law provides that a tip credit cannot reduce an \nemployee's wages below the required minimum wage. Employees report tips \nto the employers, ensuring that an adequate amount of tips are earned.\n  The facts are that seven States--Alaska, California, Minnesota, \nMontana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington--do not allow a tip credit, \nhowever, requiring raises for an hourly employee when States increase \ntheir minimum wage. The lack of a tip credit requires these employers \nto give raises to their most highly compensated employees, the tipped \nstaff, under State minimum wage laws. Non-tipped employees in these \nStates, in these businesses, are negatively impacted by the mandated \nflow of scarce labor dollars to the tipped positions. In addition, \nemployers in these States are put at a competitive disadvantage with \ntheir colleagues in the rest of the country who can allocate employee \ncompensation in a more equitable manner.\n  My amendment expands the tip credit to non-tip credit States, \nconsistent with the initial establishment of the credit under the Fair \nLabor Standards Act.\n  I can probably give a little better and more detailed explanation. \nWhat is the tip credit? The tip credit allows an employer to apply a \nportion of an employee's tip income against the employer's obligation \nto pay the minimum wage. Federal law requires a cash wage of at least \n$2.13 an hour, and it allows an employer to take a tip credit of up to \n$3.02 of the current minimum wage.\n  Seven States do not allow a tip credit, instead requiring the tipped \nemployees receive the same minimum wage as other employees. Non-tipped \nemployees are negatively impacted by the flow of scarce labor dollars. \nThis amendment expands the tip credit to non-tip credit States, \nconsistent with the initial establishment of the credit under the Fair \nLabor Standards Act. Therefore, States which do not currently recognize \nthe tip credit will be allowed to take a credit for tips of up to $3.02 \nof the minimum wage, which will be $6.25. For other current law, this \ncalculation will be based on employees' own reporting of tips to their \nemployers.\n  There is a false accusation out there, and it happened in previous \ndebates. The Democrats misconstrued the effect of this change and \nalleged it would nullify all State wage-and-hour statutes in States \nthat do not have a tip credit. This was never the intent of the \nprovision, and additional language has been added to clarify that only \naffects the minimum wage rate provisions. Furthermore, the provision \nwill only affect States that currently lack a tip credit. So we have \nadded language to clarify it so it is only the minimum wage rate \nprovisions. That is a very important part of that.\n  The sixth provision is a small business tax relief. I apologize for \nhaving to explain all of these on the floor. Again, this would be much \nbetter as committee work, but that has not been the opportunity.\n  If we are to impose greater burdens on small businesses, we should \ngive them tax relief at the same time. My amendment would extend small \nbusiness expensing, simplify the cash accounting methods, and provide \ndepreciation relief for restaurants. All these tax provisions are fully \noffset; they are paid for. But they, again, smooth the bumps on those \nbusinesses that will be most impacted by an increase in the minimum \nwage, which gives them a way to be able to pay the increase in the \nminimum wage. Remember, that has to be paid for, too. Otherwise it \ndrives them out of business, which means fewer jobs or it requires them \nto reduce other benefits, and often there are not other benefits.\n  In total, the additional provisions of my amendment are intended to \nmitigate the small business impact of a $1.10 increase in the minimum \nwage. I share the view of my colleagues, if we are going to impose such \na mandate on the Federal level, we must do our best to soften its blow. \nThis may be the best we can do today, but I entreat all of my \ncolleagues to look at the true root of the problem for minimum wage \nworkers, and that is minimum skills. We all share the same goals, to \nhelp American workers find and keep well-paying jobs. Minimum skills, \nnot minimum wages, are the problem. Education and training will solve \nthat problem and lead to the kind of increased wages and better jobs we \nall want to create for our Nation's workers.\n  Let's work together to get the Workforce Investment Act passed and \nconferenced--conferenced this time--so the President can sign it and \nget higher skills training accelerated.\n  Let me run through quickly what those six proposals are: raise the \nminimum wage by $1.10 over 18 months--we agree on that; permit family \nflextime for workers so that workers in private business have the same \nopportunity as workers in the public sector; increase the small \nbusiness exemption from the Fair Labor Standards Act so that the small \nbusiness level changes from $500,000 to $1 million; the small business \none-time paperwork errors relief, when it is for the first time and \ncorrected immediately; the small business regulatory relief actually \nbeing operated to protect small businesses; the minimum wage tip credit \nfor restaurant workers; and then some other small business tax relief \nmainly aimed at those businesses that will be most affected by what we \nare doing.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy and urge all Senators to support my amendment so we get the \nwhole process taken care of. Again, I thank my colleagues for their \npatience. I needed to explain this in some detail since it has not been \nhandled in committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Murkowski). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2077\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside and further ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 2077, pending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Cantwell, \n     Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Coleman, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. \n     Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Smith, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Baucus, \n     Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Salazar, Mrs. Lincoln, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n     Corzine, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Dodd proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2077.\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for appropriations for the Low-Income Home Energy \n                          Assistance Program)\n\n       At the end of title VI, insert the following:\n\n                Administration for Children and Families\n\n\n                   Low Income Home Energy Assistance\n\n       For making payments under title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), \n     $3,100,000,000, for the unanticipated home energy assistance \n     needs of 1 or more States, as authorized by section 2604(e) \n     of the Act (42 U.S.C. 8623(e)), which amount shall be made \n     available for obligation in fiscal year 2006 and which amount \n     is designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     402 of H. Con. Res. 95 (109th Congress), the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2006.\n\n  Mr. REED. I also ask unanimous consent Senator Dodd be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Nelson of \nFlorida be added as an original cosponsor of amendment No. 2113.\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, the topic of this amendment is increasing \nthe funds available for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, \nLIHEAP. We are about to see a second tidal surge from Katrina and Rita; \nit is not rising waters, it is rising energy prices, and those rising \nprices are going to break with ferocity on people all over this \ncountry, particularly those individuals who live in States that are \ngoing to see a cold winter, which is beginning shortly. Low-income \nAmericans are going to be faced with extraordinary challenges in \nmeeting their energy bills this winter.\n  We have already seen huge increases in prices of heating oil, natural \ngas, and propane. We understand, without some further assistance, we \nwill be in a very precarious position, and these families will be in a \ndistressed position. I particularly thank Senator Collins, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Coleman, and Senator Smith for their bipartisan \nleadership on this amendment--particularly Senator Collins--for joining \nme in this effort. She has been a stalwart over several Congresses with \nrespect to supporting the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program.\n  We are reaching across the aisle and across the country to provide \nmore assistance to the LIHEAP program. We offer this amendment with 30 \ncosponsors. It is bipartisan, stretching across the length and breadth \nof this country. It seeks to add $3.1 billion to the HUD appropriations \nbill in emergency energy assistance.\n  Energy costs for the average family using heating oil are estimated \nto hit $1,577 this winter, an increase of $378 over last winter's \nheating season. For families using natural gas, prices could hit $1,099 \nthis winter heating season, an increase of $354. Families using propane \ncan see heating costs on average this heating season to be \napproximately $1,400. That is another increase of $300. For families \nliving in poverty, energy bills now are approximately 20 percent of \ntheir income compared to 5 percent for other households. Unless we take \naction now, we are going to see families in this country, low-income \nworking families, families struggling with the issue of poverty, \nseniors who are living on fixed incomes being devastated.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I yield to the Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I would state Senator Baucus has a unanimous consent \nrequest and would like to make a few remarks prior to that. Will the \nSenator yield to Senator Baucus?\n  Mr. REED. I am prepared to yield. My colleague from Maine is here to \nspeak.\n  Mr. REID. I ask you to yield to your colleague from Montana first.\n  Mr. REED. If I could do so and then, with the order being that at the \nconclusion of Senator Baucus, Senator Collins be recognized to speak.\n  Mr. REID. We, of course, have no objection if you get the floor \nfollowing Senator Baucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Let me make sure I understand this.\n  Mr. REID. I asked the Senator from Rhode Island to yield to the \nSenator from Montana. He has a brief statement and unanimous consent \nrequest he is going to make. Then I have no problem.\n  Mr. REED. Reclaiming the floor, I ask how long the Senator from \nMontana might speak?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I expect maybe 4 or 5 or 6 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the Senator from Rhode Island and I \nhave been waiting for some time to give our comments. I expect that my \ncomments are only going to be 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We will be happy to wait until the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and the Senator from Maine finish their statements.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I think probably the most efficient way to \ndo this is let me yield the floor to the Senator from Maine. When she \nconcludes, I ask the Senator from Montana be recognized. At the \nconclusion of the comments of the Senator from Montana, if I can be \nrecognized again, I will finish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, first, let me thank my colleague and \nfriend from Rhode Island for accommodating my schedule and for his \nusual graciousness. It has been a great pleasure to work with him on an \ninitiative that is so important to low-income families in our country \nand that is increasing the funding for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. We are proposing to increase the funding to the \namount authorized by the energy legislation that was signed into law a \ncouple of months ago, so we are proposing to bring it to the fully \nauthorized level of $5.1 billion.\n  Madam President, I am sure it is very similar in your State. When I \ngo home to Maine, as I do every weekend, the No. 1 issue that people \ntalk to me about is the high cost of energy. They have expressed over \nand over their fear that they simply will not be able to afford the \ncost of heating oil for their homes this winter. The cost increases \nhave been enormous. They are, in part, attributable to the two \nhurricanes that we have endured, and that is why I view this as part of \nthe emergency response to Hurricane Katrina and Rita.\n  Right now in Maine, we have already had some nights that have plunged \nbelow freezing. In Maine, 78 percent of all households use home heating \noil to heat their homes. Currently, the cost of home heating oil is \nmore than $2.50 per gallon. I actually paid $2.72 per gallon recently. \nThat is a considerable increase, 60 cents or more a gallon, over last \nyear's already high prices.\n  These high prices greatly increase the need for assistance. More low-\nincome families are going to be in dire straits. Moreover, as it \nincreases, it has an impact on the amount of money that can be given \nout, so we have a pot of money that is going to have to be spread over \na larger population at a time when prices are soaring.\n  Last year, there was an average benefit in Maine of $480. This year \nit is expected that the benefit would have to be cut to $440. That \nwould purchase only 173 gallons of oil, far below last year's \nequivalent benefit of 251 gallons, and not nearly enough, of course, to \ngo through a Maine winter. To purchase the same amount of oil this year \nas last, Maine would need an additional $10.8 million in LIHEAP funds.\n  This really is a choice, for many low-income families in our country, \nof buying the home heating oil or natural gas that they need to keep \nwarm or putting adequate food on the table or buying much-needed \nprescription drugs. Surely, in a country as prosperous as ours, no low-\nincome family should be forced to make those kinds of choices.\n  I urge support for the amendment offered by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland and myself, and again I thank the Senator for his courtesy in \nyielding to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n\n\n                   unanimous-consent request--s. 1716\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it has been more than 7 weeks since \nHurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast--7 weeks. Nearly 1.5 million \nAmericans have been displaced. Tens of thousands of these survivors \nhave no health care coverage and no money to pay for care. It is high \ntime for passage of the Grassley-Baucus Emergency Health Care Relief \nAct, S. 1716.\n  On Monday, the Los Angeles Times ran a story on a 52-year-old \nschoolbus driver from New Orleans, Emanuel Wilson. Mr. Wilson survived \nKatrina, but his life is still at risk. Why? Because he has intestinal \ncancer and he has no health insurance.\n  Mr. Wilson was getting monthly chemotherapy injections before the \nstorm, but now he cannot get any health care.\n  He lost his job and his health coverage because of Katrina, and he is \nineligible to receive Medicaid.\n  According to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, more than half of all \nhurricane evacuees still in Louisiana who sought Medicaid coverage \nsince Katrina have been turned away. More than half were turned away. \nThese are poor people. They aren't people with a lot of money. They are \npoor people. They can't get coverage because they do not meet the rigid \neligibility guidelines under Federal Medicaid law.\n  We need to relax those guidelines on a temporary basis, on an \nemergency basis, to help those survivors desperately in need.\n  This morning, my staff met with Secretary Cerise, secretary of \nLouisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals.\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\nAnd Dr. Cerise reported that Louisiana's Medicaid Program has enrolled \n60,000 new individuals because of Katrina, which would cost the State \nabout $83 million if they were to pay for the care.\n  Louisiana has just lost about one-seventh of its total expected State \nrevenue this year, and they cannot bear these additional costs. They \nare likely to need to make dramatic cuts to the Medicaid Program if \nthey don't get help soon.\n  Dr. Cerise reports that Louisiana will have to cut all optional \nservices to beneficiaries if they do not get help.\n  What does that mean? That means ending their hospice programs, ending \ntheir pharmacy benefits, ending their institutional care for the \nmentally retarded, ending their dialysis and other benefits, cutting \noff care for their medically needy, breast and cervical cancer \npatients, as well as thousands of low-income children.\n  We have spent far too long talking about this bill. Far too many \ntimes have we been asking unanimous consent to get this bill passed--\nfar too long. These are temporary provisions.\n  America can do better. America can help its people in need in times \nof emergency.\n  Where is America? Where is the Senate?\n  My colleagues, Senator Grassley, Senator Landrieu, Senator Lincoln, \nand Senator Reid have all spoken passionately supporting moving this \nbill forward and moving it forward immediately.\n  I hope we can get this bill passed and enacted into law without \ndelay. We owe at least this much to our fellow Americans hit by Katrina \nand its aftermath.\n  It ties in very much with the latest dialog on the floor with the \nSenator from Rhode Island about the need for LIHEAP money. Energy costs \nare going up around the country. They are going up so quickly, so high, \nand it is the kind of problem facing the people down on the gulf coast.\n  I urgently ask our colleagues to support this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration \nof Calendar No. 214, S. 1716, a bill to provide emergency health care \nrelief for survivors of Hurricane Katrina; that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, if I might reserve the right to object, \nwe had this conversation on the floor before. The bill has been brought \nto the floor, and attempts have been made to pass it by unanimous \nconsent.\n  This bill includes provisions that change the reimbursement rates \nunder Medicaid for 29 States, regardless of how many evacuees they \nmight have in that State, regardless of whether they were affected by \nHurricane Katrina or Hurricane Rita. It is completely inappropriate to \ntry to make adjustments in Medicaid under the umbrella or the cover of \nhurricane relief.\n  There are legitimate questions about whether and how we can provide \nassistance to those under Medicaid affected by Hurricane Katrina or \nHurricane Rita.\n  Eight States have already been granted waivers to modify eligibility \nto help provide that coverage. But in an effort to deal with some of \nthe concerns I have--and other Senators have concerns about this bill--\nthis $9 billion bill to support a statute that gives the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services the power to change reimbursement rates to \ncompensate States for additional costs incurred under Medicaid as a \nresult of the hurricane, we would put into law the uncompensated care \npool that is part of this legislation to help deal with some of the \ncosts outside of Medicaid. We have even proposed providing some support \nand assistance to community health centers, something that is not even \nin this legislation--community health centers being so critical to \nproviding assistance not just to Medicaid beneficiaries but to those \nwho are underinsured or those who are without any health insurance for \nwhatever reason. I think these are very reasonable proposals.\n  I think this is a good-faith effort to address some of the concerns \nthat have been presented, but even in the absence of legislation \nthrough the State waiver process, through the efforts of Secretary \nLeavitt of Health and Human Services, I think every good-faith effort \nis being made to provide assistance, to provide coverage to those in \nneed.\n  Given that fact, I will object at this time to the unanimous-consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, with all due respect, we have heard \nthese lamentations before. We have heard it all, with due respect, \nbefore.\n  Let me just clear the record a little bit. The Senator mentioned \nwaivers. The Secretary has admitted that he does not have authority \nunder the waiver system to do what needs to be done. He does not have \nauthority to make these hospitals--not whole but to get some \nuncompensated care for these hospitals. He does not have authority to \ndo so. He does not have authority to make other provisions that are \nnecessary in this bill.\n  I must say this is a temporary bill. It is only on an emergency \nbasis.\n  I am willing to--and I think a lot of my colleagues are willing and \nconcerned about the costs--take it out of the unspent FEMA money. We \nappropriated in this body about $60 billion for FEMA. I understand that \nmaybe roughly $40 billion of that has not been spent.\n  If the Senator is concerned about the costs, we could take it out of \nFEMA and help people who really need help. The Secretary does not have \nthe authority to do what needs to be done. And, second, the \nadministration has not come up with any real plan to say where the \nmoney is going to come from. It is all just talk, words.\n  If the Senator from New Hampshire is willing to take the money out of \nFEMA, or if he is willing to say trim back a little bit to come up with \na deal with 29 States to immediately pass a bill that may be trimmed \ndown a little bit and paid for out of FEMA, then we would be doing the \ncountry a great deal of service.\n\n  But to stand here day in and day out for 27 weeks, for a Senator to \nstand on the floor and say we can't help people in Louisiana and the \nGulf States, we could sure help New Yorkers after 9/11. We can help \nthem, but we can't help the people on the gulf coast.\n  These are the same Medicaid provisions that we gave the people in New \nYork City as a consequence of 9/11--the same eligibility standards, the \nsame.\n  In other words, let us do it for the gulf coast people, if we can do \nit for New Yorkers. It is great for New Yorkers. We are all for it. Let \nus figure out a way to help the people in the Gulf States--help them a \nlittle bit. This administration does not want to do so, and the other \nside doesn't want to do so. I cannot believe it when the big rush right \nnow is to cut Medicaid--cut Medicaid, cut Medicaid. We want to help the \npeople.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would love to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Montana will yield for a question, I \nwould like to ask him about New York City. Isn't it a fact that after \nthe 9/11 disaster, within 2 weeks we expanded Medicaid coverage under a \ndisaster relief Medicaid assistance program so that 340,000 New Yorkers \nwere able to start receiving Medicaid for 4 months? We spent $670 \nmillion on that assistance. We did that within 2 weeks. And now 7 weeks \nhave passed, and this administration has not come forward with any help \nfor Hurricane Katrina victims when it comes to Medicaid.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In answer to the question of my colleague, it is \nabsolutely true. We came to the aid of people who needed aid in New \nYork within a couple of weeks. That was the right thing to do. We are a \npassionate people, a country willing to help people in need, \nparticularly when it is an emergency need.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a further question, this is \na bipartisan amendment which the Senator just offered, along with \nSenator Grassley, Republican of Iowa, Senator Baucus, of course, of \nMontana, and many other colleagues to come forward to try to help the \nvictims of this hurricane. Have we turned the page now? Are we not \nthinking about what happened down there? I hope we haven't.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Montana, is it a fact, No. 1, that the \nrelief\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\nthat he is proposing is temporary and short term? It is 5 months of \nMedicaid relief for these people who are in the worst circumstances. \nAnd, second, it would help States like mine and many others that have \nbrought in evacuees. In our case, we brought 5,000 evacuees into our \nState to help them out. We have incurred more expenses in Medicaid \nexpenditures to help these families so that these caring people in \nStates around the gulf coast area who are really trying to help will \nnot be ignored by the Federal Government.\n  Is that the intent of the amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. That is the intent of the \namendment. I thank the Senator for raising that point.\n  This is not a partisan effort at all. This is just a compassionate \neffort on the part of both Republicans and Democrats. I might say that \nall Senators--Republicans and Democrats--in the States affected would \nlike to see this bill passed. All the Governors in the States \naffected--Republicans and Democrats--would like to see this bill \npassed. The House delegations from the States affected would like to \nsee this bill passed. It is very much bipartisan.\n  The second point the Senator made is a very good one. A lot of \nevacuees have gone to a lot of States across the country--many in \nIllinois. Some have come to my State in Montana from New Orleans. We \nare very gracious and want to do all we can to help the people who are \nso dislocated.\n  If we stop and think for a moment, the Senators lead pretty \ncomfortable lives. For these people, it is incredible hardships they \nare going through. We forget all they have to go through. They don't \nhave houses, anyplace to live, no way to pay bills, no job, their kids \nare out of school, or where they can go to school, health care needs--\nthey are incredibly affected.\n  I do not know how many Members have gone down to the gulf coast. \nRaise your hand if you have gone down to the gulf coast and have seen \nit all. There are two. We have seen it. It is Biblical. There is not a \nword for it. It is a tragedy that is affecting people on the gulf \ncoast. It is Biblical. My Lord, my God, why can't the Senate do \nsomething about it?\n  Why are we here, Senators? To say no? That is not why we are here. We \nare here to do the right thing. We are not asking for the Moon. We are \njust asking for a little bit of help.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can ask one more question, so those who are \nfollowing this debate understand, the Senator asked unanimous consent \nto go to this temporary measure--a 5-month measure, a bipartisan \nmeasure--to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, and because one \nSenator from one State on the other side of the aisle objected, we \ncannot move to consider this issue at this time. Is that true?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is correct. That is the situation we are in.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if the Senator will yield for a \nquestion, I think I heard those who object to the unanimous consent \nrequest of the Senator from Montana suggest that somehow he is trying \nto solve a problem that doesn't exist; that this can be handled in \nother ways. Could the Senator from Montana describe to me the \ncircumstances of people who are affected? If this legislation is not \nmade available on an emergency basis in human terms, isn't it a fact \nthat we have people, particularly low-income people, who have lost \neverything?\n  Incidentally, I went to the Armory here in Washington DC and talked \nto those folks who have come here, left home with nothing to escape the \nravages of the flood waters and are there with their children and the \nclothes on their back and nothing else.\n  What are the real consequences for people who are in that situation \nif the Senator's legislation is not adopted? We did this for 9/11 \nvictims. We did it for a good reason, I assume. If we don't do it here, \nand now weeks have marched by with no action, what are the human \nconsequences of our deciding not to do this?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the Senator's question. People are not going \nto get health care. The diabetics will be scrambling wondering where \nthey are going to get their insulin shots. People getting chemotherapy \nwill be wondering where in the world they are going to get their \nchemotherapy. For mentally affected people, where are they going to get \ntheir assistance? Particularly those who have lost their jobs and don't \nhave any insurance anymore, where are they going to get their \ninsurance? If they lost their jobs and they do not have money to even \npay for basics, let alone health care, how are they going to pay for \nfood? Where are they going to live? It is incredible.\n\n  I wish all Members in this Senate would go to the gulf coast and walk \naround New Orleans, walk around the gulf coast of Mississippi, and \nfeel, see, smell, taste how devastating this tragedy is. We would be \nrushing to pass this legislation if Senators would go down there to see \nwhat is going on.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask an additional question, this is about \nhealth care. Health care is not a luxury. When you or your kids are \nsick, particularly in the circumstances where you have been the victim \nof a significant disaster, you have been displaced and lost everything, \nhealth care ought not be a function of whether you have money in your \nbillfold.\n  I ask the Senator from Montana, is it the case that your legislation \nwill not break the bank? You have suggested other ways to pay for it. \nIt is bipartisan. You are coming to talk about something that is an \nessential for people. This is not some luxury. We are talking about \nhealth care. When we talk about the five most important things for \npeople here, there, or wherever, health care is right near the top. If \nyou do not have health care, if you do not have your health, you do not \nhave much.\n  The Senator from Montana has been here a number of times. My hope \nwould be that our colleagues would not object and that the Grassley-\nBaucus proposal would be accepted and we would move on. This ought not \nbe a point of contention at all. This ought to be easy for this \nCongress.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I might also add, the primary sponsor of \nthis legislation is the chairman of the Committee on Finance, Senator \nChuck Grassley from Iowa. Senator Grassley is known in this Senate, \nprobably more than any Member for doing the right thing. He is not a \npartisan. He is not political. He does what he thinks is right. It is \nclear to the chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance that this is \nright. I join with him to do something that is right.\n  We have talked this out with all members of the committee, both \nsides, how to tailor this, modify it, make it work or not work, and I \nam quite confidence it would be agreed to unanimously by all members of \nthe committee.\n  I mentioned the States affected. The Senators of the States affected \nall want this. The Governors all want this--and there are more \nRepublican than Democrat. And the mayors want it because they know it \nis the right thing to do.\n  Again I make the request.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \napologize for taking additional time, I know Senator Reed is due to be \nrecognized by consent as soon as this lengthy and, in my opinion, \nunnecessary discussion is complete. It is important to note this bill \ndoes not take the funding out of FEMA as has been represented. We \nsuggested that.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator is willing to take it out of FEMA, we are \nwilling to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized under the previous \nagreement.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I will continue my remarks about the \nLIHEAP program. I certainly salute the Senator from Montana for his \npassion, his eloquence, and his sense of decency. We should be moving \non this legislation. It is a bipartisan effort, just as this LIHEAP \nlegislation is a bipartisan effort. They are both linked by the \ndevastation in the gulf. So many families have been displaced from \ntheir homes, their homes destroyed. They are looking for health care. \nOther families in the Northeast, in the Midwest, in the Far West, and \nin the Mountain States where this winter will be cold and difficult to \nbear will also see the effects of Katrina. They have seen them already \nin rising energy prices.\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\n  As I indicated in my prior remarks, this is the second wave, the \nsecond surge. The first was waters through the gulf. The second is \nincreased energy prices for the rest of the country.\n  No family should be forced to make choices between heating or eating. \nThat is precisely what many families will be faced with this winter \nunless we adopt this proposal and increase LIHEAP funding by $3.1 \nbillion.\n  The RAND Corporation found in a study that low-income households \nreduced food expenditures by roughly the same amount as their increases \nin fuel expenditures. They cut back on food to pay for heat. That is \nnot something any American wants to see or wants us to tolerate.\n  It is particularly difficult for seniors. Recently, I visited the \nhome of Mr. Ohanian in Cranston, RI. Mr. Ohanian is an 88-year-old \nveteran of our military service. He served this country. Now he lives \non a Social Security check of $779 a month. One does not have to have \nadvanced training in economics to figure out that with these energy \nprices this year in the Northeast--Senator Collins indicated she was \npaying $2.70 a gallon for heating oil--that adds up quite quickly, and \nit wipes out a monthly income of $779. As a result, Mr. Ohanian has to \ngo to his daughter's house sometimes for food, goes to soup kitchens to \nget help. He deserves it. He served this country in a most difficult \ntime, in uniform. What we have is a situation where last year Mr. \nOhanian received $600 in LIHEAP payments. It helped. It did not pay for \nall the fuel costs, but it helped. Unless we put this money in, his \ncosts will be way out of proportion to what he can bear.\n  Recently, the Social Security COLA was announced. It is $65 a month. \nAny increase is appreciated, but that is already wiped out more or less \nby increased contributions to health care programs that are required. \nWhen you put on top of that for a senior this huge spike in energy \nprices--be it natural gas, heating oil, or propane--they are losing \nground rapidly, unless, of course, we act to at least bring them up to \nthe level of last year's program.\n  We need to fully fund the LIHEAP program at the $5.1 billion \nauthorized in the Energy bill. This amendment would do that. It would \nadd $3.1 billion in emergency spending to the $2 billion the President \nhas requested. That is roughly what we had last year, just a little bit \nbelow. Do the math. If we have just $2 billion and we have increased \nenergy prices--just take heating oil. Last year, heating oil was \nroughly $1.92. Expensive? Yes. Now it is $2.70. The same amount of \nmonthly income, huge increases in energy costs. How can we provide that \nassistance we provided just last year?\n  As Senator Collins indicated, look at the poverty numbers. Poverty \nhas increased every year for the last several years. There are more \npeople qualified for this program. This is an anticipated disaster--in \nsome respects, the same way Katrina was anticipated.\n  I hope we can learn from Katrina, not just sit back and watch idly, \nwatch the impact, watch poor people suffer. Not just poor people who \nwere caught up in the tumult and terror of New Orleans--but poor people \nin Portland, ME; New Haven, CT; in Cleveland, OH; in Seattle, WA; in \nButte, MT. I expect it gets cold out there in the winter. They will be \ncaught up.\n  I thought after Katrina we had a coming together, led by the \nPresident, to recognize we are failing people who are poor, that we are \nnot doing what we have to do to keep faith with them. I can remember \nhis words at the Washington National Cathedral. Have those words \nevaporated already? Are those words not operative now? I hope they are. \nI hope we take them to heart. If we do, we will pass this amendment, \nand we will pass the legislation of Senator Baucus and Senator \nGrassley. That is what I thought the President was telling us to do at \nthe Cathedral speech.\n  Now, even if we do have funding of an additional $3.1 billion, we are \nstill only serving about one-seventh of the 35 million households poor \nenough to qualify for assistance. So we are not talking about a program \nthat has so much money that they do not know what to do with it. What \nthey have is so many customers and clients that they do not know what \nto do with them. And what happens, is these people will apply to the \ncommunity action agencies across the country, and they will be put on \nwaiting lists. They will try to help some. We can do much better. I \nhope we can start by passing this legislation.\n  We also need Presidential leadership. What has happened from the \nspeech on the pulpit of the National Cathedral until today when it \ncomes to LIHEAP? Nothing. Those were very powerful words, but they \nrequire powerful actions. We have not seen, in this respect, those \nactions.\n  We have to do other things to get our energy house in order. In fact, \nthis is not just an issue of domestic politics. It is probably the \nsingle most important thing we can do over the next several years to \nimprove our strategic position in the world vis-a-vis those who would \nbe our adversaries or those who compete with us. From a national \nsecurity standpoint, we have to take steps to make our energy future \nmore independent, more sensible. But we have to do things today that \nwill help Americans.\n\n  I am very proud Senator Cantwell is a cosponsor of this particular \namendment. She is also the sponsor of the Energy Emergency Consumer \nProtection Act to bring prices down at the gas pump in the wake of \nnatural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.\n  In addition, we have to pass Senator Dorgan's Windfall Profit Rebate \nAct which imposes a temporary windfall profit tax on big oil companies \nand uses the revenue to bring a rebate to American consumers to help \noffset the higher cost of oil and gasoline products. I am told the oil \ncompanies--the energy companies--will be reporting their quarterly \nearnings in the next few days, and most estimates are they could be the \nmost profitable reports ever issued by companies in this country \nbecause of this extraordinary run-up in pricing. Some of that money \nshould come back to Americans.\n  Total energy spending in this Nation this year will approach $1 \ntrillion--24 percent higher than in 2004. It will claim the largest \nshare of U.S. output since the end of the oil crisis 20 years ago. Oil \nand natural gas companies make huge profits while workers' salaries are \ndeclining in real terms. This is wrong. We have to fix it.\n  We have to pass Senator Cantwell's legislation, Senator Dorgan's \nlegislation, and, of course, immediately, we have to help restore \nfunding and increase funding for LIHEAP program. The President and \nSecretary Bodman have called on Americans to reduce their energy use. \nThey have to lead by example. One way to lead is to support, \narticulate, and advocate, for sensible energy programs and this LIHEAP \nproposal to increase that funding.\n  We have to do much more. I hope we begin, with respect to energy, by \nrecognizing the pending crisis that will face so many families in this \ncountry, so many seniors. They will be cold this winter. They will give \nup eating so they can heat their homes. They will miss mortgage \npayments and rent payments because they have to at least stay warm.\n  We can do much better. America can do better. I hope we do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Pursuant to section 402 of H. Con. Res. 95 of the 109th \nCongress, the fiscal year 2006 concurrent resolution on the budget, I \nmake a point of order against the emergency designation contained in \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I move to waive the applicable sections of \nthe act referenced by the Senator and at the appropriate time would ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that this measure \nbe set aside to be set for a vote at a time determined by the leaders \non both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I would \nlike to enter into a time agreement to speak on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object to the request?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, there is time to speak. We would be happy \nto find the time for the distinguished Senator from Washington to \nspeak. We are just asking this be set aside. If the objection is \nsustained, we will go immediately to a vote and get it out of the way.\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: I believe what \nhappened, the floor manager raised a budget point of order. I have \nrequested a waiver of that act. We have agreed at some time in the \nfuture we will have a vote on that. Now it is in order to have further \ndiscussion of the amendment, and Senator Cantwell can discuss her \namendment.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I believe that is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senators are correct.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, before I yield the floor to the other \nSenators who wish to speak, first, let me point out that while LIHEAP \nis a very important subject, it has nothing to do with this bill. There \nwill be the Labor-HHS appropriations bill on the floor next week. There \nwill also be a supplemental bill which will deal with it. While I am a \nbig supporter of LIHEAP, this measure should be appropriately discussed \nin the forum where LIHEAP is handled. Either one of those two vehicles \nis appropriate.\n  Now, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 today, the \nSenate proceed to a vote in relation to the Kennedy amendment No. 2063, \nto be followed by a vote in relation to the Enzi amendment No. 2115. I \nfurther ask consent that prior to those votes there be 3 hours for \ndebate equally divided between Senators Enzi and Kennedy to run \nconcurrently on both the Enzi and Kennedy amendments; provided further \nthat no second-degree amendments be in order to either amendment prior \nto the votes. I further ask consent that if either amendment does not \nhave 60 votes in the affirmative, that amendment then be automatically \nwithdrawn or fall to the point of order, if applicable. I further ask \nconsent that there be 2 minutes equally divided prior to each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, reserving the right to object--I do not \nthink I will object--but in order to expedite consideration of \namendments on the floor, I was wanting to offer the remaining amendment \nI have, with very brief comments, so that at least I have offered the \namendment on behalf of myself and Senator Craig. I was hoping to be \nable to do that following the remarks of the Senator from Washington, \nwho I believe is going to comment on the legislation she is \ncosponsoring with Senator Reed. So if it would be acceptable to the \nchairman and ranking member, following the remarks of the Senator from \nWashington, if I would be recognized simply to lay the amendment down. \nI ask unanimous consent to do that.\n  Mr. BOND. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the initial request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2077\n\n  Madam President, I do rise to support the Reed-Collins amendment to \nfurther make a down payment on the low-income energy assistance program \nknown as LIHEAP.\n  This is a program the State of Washington knows all too well. I say \nthat because our State was hard hit by an energy crisis in the last \nseveral years that left many low-income people suffering the \nconsequences of high energy costs. If anything, the Northwest is a \nposter child for what is about to happen to the rest of the country. \nThose results were devastating. In one county alone, Snohomish County, \nwhere I live, we had a 44-percent increase in disconnect rates in 1 \nyear. That meant 14,000 people lost power to their homes because of \nhigh energy costs.\n  Those high energy costs were also passed on to school districts, \nwhich had to choose between hiring teachers and getting books and \npaying the high cost of energy. It also had an impact on economic \ndevelopment. Businesses decided that perhaps they did not want to move \nto that county if they were energy-intensive users and businesses on \nlow margins until the energy rates come down again. We saw people who \nactually lost their jobs and lost their pensions because of those high \nenergy costs.\n  What this amendment does, added to this bill, is to give the \nconsumers in America who are the most hard hit by energy costs some \nrelief. If you think about it, we are talking about the elderly, the \ndisabled, those who are on low incomes. We are talking about an \nindividual who may make less than $12,000 a year or a couple who may \nmake less than $16,000 a year. Now they are faced with anywhere from a \n30- to 50-percent increase in energy costs. It is a question as to \nwhether they are going to be able to keep the lights on and the heat in \nthe home or whether they are going to be left out in the cold by this \nadministration and by this Congress.\n  I hope my colleagues will do the right thing in adopting the Reed-\nCollins amendment and being serious about LIHEAP, knowing the \ndevastating consequences of the high cost of energy to our economy and \npeople on the margins. It is heartless to think we would continue to \nadopt resolution after resolution dealing with other impacts to our \neconomy and leave those most vulnerable out in the cold.\n  The LIHEAP Program serves a very small percentage of the people who \nactually qualify. Last year, 72,000 Washington State residents received \nassistance from the LIHEAP Program, but many more could actually \nqualify. That is, there are many more who are living on the margins who \nneed that kind of help and assistance to stay in their home.\n  Last week, I met with a woman who has lung cancer, the mother of \nfive, who is disabled, who needs the LIHEAP Program to continue to \nremain in her home. Yet 76 percent of those who qualify who will not \nget aid. This piece of legislation will not help all of them, but it \nwill help a small percent. It will help a small percent of Northwest \nresidents who will be battling the high cost of energy again for \nanother year in a row, to get some assistance from the low-energy \nincome program.\n\n  This amendment should be a top priority for the Members of this body. \nI say that because, having fought to get these LIHEAP Programs from the \ncontingency fund in the past when my State was greatly impacted, I know \nhow important it was to the residents who actually received them. Now \nthe rest of the country is going to be impacted by those same dynamics \nof very high energy costs. The question is whether we will, as a body, \napprove the Reed-Collins amendment to actually take the appropriations \nlevel up to the level that has been in the authorizing bill. I think it \nis the prudent thing to do. I think it is the wise thing to do to help \nthe residents of this country, who are going to suffer from a very \ntough winter and high energy costs.\n  I, like my colleague Senator Reed, want to fight for other \nlegislation that will help us reduce the high cost of energy and \ncertainly look at the practices of predatory pricing. We need to give \nconsumers the confidence that there is competition in the marketplace, \nthat there are Federal agencies that will protect consumers from price \ngouging, and that those who participate in price-gouging activities \nwill spend time in jail. But in the meantime, as we are continuing to \npush and fight for that legislation, we need to make sure those who are \nmost vulnerable in our society get the help and support they deserve. \nSo I hope my colleagues will take the Reed-Collins amendment this \nafternoon and realize we cannot give tax breaks to others and leave \nthose most vulnerable in our society without the hope of a warm, secure \nwinter.\n  America can do better. We can take care of the elderly, the disabled, \nand the low income when it means they are going to have to pay \nexorbitant energy costs.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thune). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2133\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senator Craig from Idaho, Senator Enzi from Wyoming, and \nSenator Baucus from Montana, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself, \n     Mr. Craig, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2133.\n\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To restrict enforcement of the Cuban Assets Control \n              Regulations with respect to travel to Cuba)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) None of the funds made available in this Act \n     may be used to administer or enforce part 515 of title 31, \n     Code of Federal Regulations (the Cuban Assets Control \n     Regulations) with respect to any travel or travel-related \n     transaction.\n       (b) The limitation established in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply to--\n       (1) the administration of general or specific licenses for \n     travel or travel-related transactions;\n       (2) section 515.204, 515.206, 515.332, 515.536, 515.544, \n     515.547, 515.560(c)(3), 515.569, 515.571, or 515.803 of such \n     part 515; or\n       (3) transactions in relation to any business travel covered \n     by section 515.560(g) of such part 515.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I offer this bipartisan amendment on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Craig, Senator Enzi, and Senator Baucus. It \nis an amendment that has been considered previously, and considered \nsuccessfully by the Senate, but it has not made it into law because of \nproblems in conference committees. It deals with the issue of \nrestricting the rights of the American people to travel to Cuba.\n  As you know, we now have a situation where the American people are \nnot free to travel to Cuba. We are free to travel to China, a Communist \ncountry. We are free to travel to Vietnam, a Communist country. We are \nfree to travel to North Korea, a Communist country. We are not free to \ntravel to Cuba, however. The reason for that is Fidel Castro has been \nsticking his finger in America's eye for a long while. It is a \nCommunist country, a government that causes a lot of problems for our \ncountry, and the decision was made some long while ago that we are \ngoing to somehow punish Fidel Castro by restricting the American \npeople's right to travel to Cuba.\n  We also, for 40-some years now, have had an embargo with respect to \nthe country of Cuba. For most of that time, we also prevented American \nfarmers from selling food to the country of Cuba. I have always felt it \nis basically immoral to use food as a weapon and to prevent the selling \nof food to the Cubans. Canadians sell food to the Cubans. European \nfarmers sell food to the Cubans. But we could not; that is, until then-\nSenator Ashcroft from Missouri and I offered an amendment on the floor \nof the Senate that opened, just a crack, that embargo so that we are \nnow able to sell some food into the country of Cuba.\n  We have sold about $1 billion worth of food since that amendment of \nours became law. Even now, the administration is trying to shut down \nthat ability of farmers to sell food into Cuba, by dramatically \nchanging the legal definition of the term ``payment of cash in \nadvance'' that is in the law, something the Congressional Research \nService believes is inappropriate for the administration to do. With \nthis change of definition they are actually requiring the payment for \nthe food products our farmers would sell into Cuba to be made before \nthe food is even shipped. That is not the way commerce works, and yet \nthey are doing that to try to shut down the ability of American farmers \nto sell food into Cuba.\n  Nonetheless, we have sold $1 billion worth of food to the Cubans. It \nis the right thing to do. Withholding food and medicine as a part of \nany embargo is the wrong thing to do. Fidel Castro has never missed \nbreakfast, lunch, or dinner because of our embargo. He has eaten just \nfine, thank you. It is poor, sick, and hungry people who get hurt with \nthese kinds of public policies.\n  I put in this appropriations bill at the subcommittee level a \nprovision that trips the administration's attempt to inhibit farmers \nfrom selling into Cuba. So I fixed that problem. That is in the bill as \nit comes to the floor. We had kind of a contentious discussion about \nthat in the subcommittee, but I won. And again, on a bipartisan basis, \nwe stuck that in the bill. It says to this administration: You cannot \nbe doing these things that we believe are not legal to impede the \nability of American farmers to sell food into the Cuban marketplace.\n  We have not, however, dealt with the issue of restricting the \nAmerican people's right to travel to Cuba. Are we hurting Fidel Castro \nby prohibiting Americans from traveling to Cuba? I do not think so. All \nthat does is slap the American people around by restricting their right \nto travel.\n  Let me show you a couple of examples, if I might. This young woman in \nthis picture was in my office. This young woman's name is Joni Scott, a \nwonderful young woman. She went to Cuba. She went to Cuba to distribute \nfree Bibles on the streets of Cuban cities. Joni Scott went to \ndistribute free Bibles in Cuba. Why? She is a person of great faith, \nwith a missionary spirit, and she wanted to take that faith and talk \nabout that faith with the people of Cuba.\n  Well, guess what happened to Joni Scott. The U.S. government says you \ncan't distribute free Bibles to the people of Cuba. You have to get a \nlicense from the State Department to go to Cuba, and they are not going \nto give you a license. She did not know that, of course. She simply \nwent to Cuba to distribute free Bibles. The U.S. government slapped her \nwith a big fine. Do you know who did that? The folks who are being \nfunded in the bill, OFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, deep in \nthe bowels of the Treasury Department.\n  The people in OFAC are supposed to be tracking the financing of \nterrorism. They are the folks who ought to be looking at the arteries \nthat control the money that finances Osama bin Laden, for example, and \nother terrorist organizations. But guess what. Those folks down in \nOFAC, the Office of Foreign Assets Control, have been spending their \ntime tracking down American citizens who are suspected of taking \nvacations in Cuba--American citizens under suspicion of taking \nvacations in Cuba.\n  Well, they tracked Joni Scott down and slapped a big fine on Joni \nScott, an American citizen, for trying to distribute free Bibles in \nCuba. Apparently, they are not even embarrassed about it.\n  This is a picture of Sergeant Lazo, U.S. Army National Guard. He won \nthe Bronze Star for bravery in the country of Iraq, fighting for this \ncountry. His children are in Cuba. One of his kids was very ill. After \nhe finished his tour of duty in Iraq and was back in this country, he \nwanted to go visit his sick son. This United States soldier, a hero, \nhaving fought and won a Bronze Star in Iraq for his country, was told \nby his country: You might have been fighting for freedom in Iraq, but \nyou don't have the freedom as an American soldier--you don't have the \nfreedom as an American citizen--to go visit your sick child in Cuba. \nUnbelievable.\n  We voted on that here on the floor of the Senate. The only way I \ncould get that up for a vote was to require suspension of the rules, \nwhich takes 66 votes. I got 60 votes. It fell short. So this man has \nnever been allowed to go to Cuba to visit his child.\n\n  There is an epilog to this. His children are going to come here for a \nbrief visit. The Cuban Government has approved that. But the U.S. \nGovernment won't give him the freedom to travel to Cuba to visit his \nchildren.\n  I could talk about Joan Slote. Joan Slote answered an ad in a \nbicycling magazine to take a cycling trip to Cuba. Joan was 75 years \nold. She was a cyclist and she wanted to go on a bicycling tour with a \nCanadian bicycling group. She did. She came back and found out her son \nhad brain cancer. She didn't get her mail on time and didn't see that \nthe Federal Government was trying to fine her $10,000 for having \ntraveled to Cuba to ride a bike. Because she was attending to her son, \nshe didn't get the letter from the Treasury Department, so they decided \nthey were going to try to slap an attachment on her Social Security \ncheck.\n  This is America? I don't think so. We should restrict the freedom of \nthe American people because we want to slap around Fidel Castro? How \nabout deciding we are not going to restrict the freedom of the American \npeople. If you want to bring a different kind of government to Cuba, \nyou do it through trade and travel. That is what we argue in regard to \nother countries. This administration and past administrations have said \nthat the way to advance the interests toward democracy and greater \nhuman rights in Communist China is through trade and travel. The way to\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\nadvance the interests toward greater human rights and democracy in \nCommunist Vietnam is through trade and travel. Cuba? No, we have to \nrestrict the right of the American people to travel to Cuba. And if \nthey do, track them down. There is a little agency, this arthritic \nagency in the Department of Treasury, called OFAC. They have more \npeople in that agency tracking American citizens who are suspected of \ngoing to Cuba than they have searching for the financial links that are \nsupporting Osama bin Laden's terrorism. Isn't that unbelievable? I have \nhalf a notion to offer an amendment to get rid of OFAC. We have all \nthese acronyms around here. All I know is, these are people sitting \nsomeplace in the basement of the Treasury Department trying to figure \nout, through lists of names, whether somebody might have gone to Cuba. \nAnd God forbid they brought a cigar back. Let's double the fine.\n  In fact, even more Byzantine, last year OFAC sent people to airports \naround the country to train Border Patrol and Homeland Security agents \non how to intercept Americans who were suspected of visiting Cuba. I \nlooked through the list of what they recovered. The most ominous thing \nthey recovered was carbon dioxide used to make seltzer water. They did \npick up a couple cigars and some ordinary cold medicine. But they \ncertainly took some resources away from Homeland Security that probably \nought to have been looking at terrorist threats so they could track \ndown Joni Scott who wants to deliver Bibles on the streets of a city in \nCuba.\n  There was also the disabled sports team that participates in \nmarathons using artificial legs and in wheelchairs. They planned to \nparticipate in the Havana Marathon and then distribute racing \nwheelchairs and handcycles to Cuba's disabled athletes. Except OFAC \nsaid that our team couldn't go. These disabled Americans were told, no, \nyou can't go. That is unbelievable.\n  We will have a vote on this. The President will threaten a veto of \nthe bill if it is in the bill, and we will have people around here \nscratching their heads and thumbing their suspenders and saying: How \nshould I vote on this?\n  How about a simple vote that represents a little bit of common sense, \njust a smidgeon. Go to any cafe in America, have a cup of coffee and \nask somebody, do you think it is a good idea that we ought to slap \naround the American people and go investigate them and chase them down \nand slap them with a $10,000 fine because they joined a Canadian \nbicycle tour of Cuba? Or do you think we ought to say to a veteran who \nearned the Bronze Star for heroism in Iraq that when you come back to \nthis country, you have all the freedoms of an American except you don't \nhave the freedom to travel to Cuba to see your sick son? We know what \nthe answer is. If we have enough people around here with the courage to \nvote the right way, to use a smidgeon of common sense--I am not asking \neverybody to use all the common sense, just a smidgeon, this just \nrequires a blink--to vote the right way, maybe we will get something \ndone.\n  This isn't about Democrats or Republicans. It is about public policy \nthat makes sense for this country. If something is happening that is \nbasically ``dumb,'' we ought to fix it. This makes no sense. This \npolicy is at odds with our entire foreign policy with respect to other \nCommunist countries. Can you imagine today if I proposed having the \nCuba policy with respect to China and Vietnam? We would say to those \nAmericans, you can't travel to China. Why? Because we don't like the \nChinese Government, so you can't go there. Does that make any sense? Do \nyou think that would be in our best interest? Would that represent good \nforeign policy? The answer is no.\n  We have advocated that the best way to move these countries toward \ngreater human rights and greater democracy is through trade and travel. \nIt would be nice if the only voice Cubans are hearing would not be \nFidel Castro but, in fact, Joni Scott or Joan Slote or a couple from \nDubuque who might be vacationing in Havana. It would be nice if the \nCuban people would hear those voices as well. They do not now because \nthey are prohibited as a result of American law. It is a law I aim to \nchange.\n  I offer this amendment with my colleagues, Senators Craig, Enzi, and \nBaucus--two Republicans, two Democrats. This is not about partisanship. \nIt is about doing the right thing. My hope is this amendment will see a \nsuccessful vote. I understand there will be some sumo wrestling between \nnow and when we get a vote, because no one ever wants to have a vote on \nthis. There will be all kinds of contortions going on to find a way to \navoid having a vote on this. But it is perfectly germane and relevant. \nIt is a restriction on funding. My expectation would be before the bill \ngets off the floor, we would have a vote on this. I hope a sufficient \nnumber of colleagues on both sides of the aisle will decide to vote for \nit and we can get this done finally.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by my \nfriend from North Dakota. He has made an excellent case for this \namendment. I want to note that I am a cosponsor of bipartisan \nlegislation introduced earlier this year that would allow this travel \nbetween the United States and Cuba.\n  Current policy with regard to Cuba, as enforced by the Treasury \nDepartment's Office of Foreign Assets Control, permits travel to Cuba \ntoday only with permission in the form of a license from the Treasury \noffice for certain reasons such as visits to relatives or journalism or \nreligious or humanitarian purposes. According to Treasury documents, \nbetween 1996 and 2003, about a third of Cuba travel cases opened for \ninvestigation were referred for civil penalty enforcement action.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota said, these typical penalty \nassessments for unauthorized travel range from $3,000 to $7,500. That \nis preposterous. For the last 40 years, the United States has \nmaintained this isolationist position toward Cuba, and the current \nregime has been there the entire time. I believe, as the Senator from \nNorth Dakota so eloquently stated, that permitting travel to Cuba will \nhelp demonstrate to Cuba's citizens what a democracy is all about.\n  I tell my colleague that I had a young group of baseball players who \nwent through the entire rigmarole as a young team to go to Cuba a \nnumber of years back. They had to go through an entire process. It was \namazing what they had to go through to go down and participate in a \nLittle League team playoff with a number of players from Cuba. I had \nthem come back and visit with me when they returned. They wanted to \nthank me for helping them get through this process. I sat there and \nlistened to them as they told me that they actually lost every single \ngame. Finally, it was so lopsided that the Cuban young boys and they \ngot together and decided, this is ridiculous. We are just losing. So \nthey intermixed their teams, half Cuban and half American, and finished \nthe playoffs that way. What a great thing for democracy. These young \npeople showed to all of us exactly what we want happening in Cuba, that \nwe can sit down, a group of 12-year-old boys, and learn how to get \nalong and to be able to promote some real important values.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am wondering if that wasn't under the old rules. The \nnew rules have been tightened up dramatically by administration edict. \nUnder the new rules, teams such as that in most cases would not be able \nto visit Cuba.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is absolutely correct. This was about 10 \nyears ago. Since that time, if these young kids were to come today to \nmy office to ask for help, they would not be able to go and do it. What \na way to dampen the enthusiasm of young boys in our country. It is \ntelling them that democracy is not about conversations and learning and \neducation and participation. I think that is a negative message. I \nappreciate the Senator's offering the amendment. I know the \nadministration has issued a veto threat on this bill if this provision \nis allowed to be included. I say that veto threats have been made on \nother provisions in this bill. I don't see any reason why the Senate \nshould not go on record and state its view. It is time to lift the \ntravel restrictions on Cuba for all the reasons the Senator from North \nDakota has outlined today. I hope we will\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\nget to a vote and be able to move forward on this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me finally show the chart I mentioned. \nI have many others. OFAC, Office of Foreign Assets Control, down in the \nbowels of the Treasury Department, is supposed to be tracking \nterrorists. Here is what OFAC did. These are disabled marathoners. They \ntrained and trained. In fact, as I understand it, these folks even had \nairline tickets, and they had everything all set. But were they allowed \nto go to the international meet in Havana? No. No, they were turned \ndown by our country because you don't have the freedom to do that. To \nsay that these folks were disappointed is an understatement. They might \nwonder about whether we have freedom in this country, when we don't \nhave the freedom to travel to this Cuba. Why? Because we don't like its \nleaders.\n  Look, there are many countries that have leaders I am not \nparticularly fond of. I don't want to restrict the right of the \nAmerican people to travel there. In addition to Joni Scott and disabled \nathletes and so many others, the stories now are unbelievable. In the \nlast 3 years, this has been laced up tight, even for folks with close \nrelatives. I can tell you of people whose parents were dying, on their \ndeathbed, 3 days away from dying, and their children in this country \nwere not allowed to go see their mother or father in Cuba.\n  I won't put up the picture of the guy from the State of Washington \nwhose father died, and his last wishes were that his ashes be dispersed \non the grounds of the church he served as a pastor in Cuba. So a \ncompliant son, after the death of his father, said: I want to do that. \nIt was his last wish. He took his dad's ashes and went to Cuba and went \nto the church and distributed his father's ashes on the grounds of the \nchurch his father had ministered at for many years. Then this country's \nGovernment tracked him down and tried to slap a big fine on him for \ndoing it. Unbelievable. We can do better than that. Our country doesn't \ndeserve this sort of nonsense.\n  I appreciate the support of the Senator from Washington. As I \nindicated, this is bipartisan. It is not about Republicans or \nDemocrats. It is about what is thoughtful and what is thoughtless. \nLet's choose the thoughtful approach for a change.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2063, as Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, there is a general \nagreement among the leadership that the time between 1:30 p.m. and 4:30 \np.m. be equally divided between myself, who offered an increase in the \nminimum wage, and the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, who has offered a \ndifferent approach. We will have an opportunity to control the time in \nthat way.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself what time I might use.\n  At 4:30 p.m., we will have an opportunity to vote in this body on \nwhether there ought to be an increase in the minimum wage, a minimum \nwage that has not been increased over the last 9 years. I am very \nhopeful that we will vote in this body in support of the proposal I \nhave before the Senate which will increase the minimum wage by $1.10. \nThis is the figure that was included in the Republican alternative of \nover a year ago. The Republican alternative had additional provisions, \nand we will have an opportunity to talk about those proposals.\n  For the information of those people who might be listening to the \ndebate, here is our amendment. It is 2 pages long, and it provides an \nincrease in the minimum wage of $1.10. This is the Republican proposal, \nwhich is 87 pages long, which will change the whole concept of the \nminimum wage and effectively eliminate coverage of the minimum wage for \nup to 10 million Americans.\n  The increase in the minimum wage is not complicated. We increase it \n$1.10. We do it over a 2-year period. It is all in the 2-page amendment \nI have offered.\n  There is an alternative, which is the Republican alternative, which \nbasically undermines, in a very significant and important way, the \ncoverage for minimum wage workers and effectively eliminates coverage \nand protection, even for minimum wage workers.\n  We will have a chance for this body to make a decision as to whether \nthey want to see those workers in this country, who have been left out \nand left behind, get a modest bump in their income.\n  I offered this measure on this legislation because this is the \nvehicle which carried the increase in the cost of living for Members of \nthe Congress and Senate. It seems to me, if we were going to vote on \nthat, we ought to vote on an increase in the minimum wage. It is the \njudgment--and one I support--that Members of Congress will not take a \ncost-of-living increase in their pay this year. We defer that increase.\n  The fact remains that over the last 9 years, the Congress has \nincreased its pay by $28,000 on seven different occasions. On seven \ndifferent occasions, it has raised its salary, but we have not \nincreased the pay for those who are at the lower end of the economic \nladder who are making minimum wage. I think that is absolutely \nunconscionable. We will have an opportunity this afternoon to find out \nwhether we are going to do that. In the institution that has raised its \nsalary $28,000 over the last 9 years, we will have an opportunity to \nsee whether we are going to increase annual income by $2,300.\n  This chart is an indication of the tradition of the Senate since the \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  This demonstrates very clearly the increase in the minimum wage. The \ninitiation was by President Roosevelt back in the 1930s and then Harry \nTruman increased it and then Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, increased \nit. The history of the increase in the minimum wage has been \nbipartisan. Dwight Eisenhower increased it. President Kennedy increased \nit; President Johnson; President Ford, a Republican, increased it; \nPresident Carter increased it; President Bush 1 increased it and \nPresident Clinton. So this has been bipartisan.\n  It is difficult for me to understand how the increase in the minimum \nwage has ended up as a partisan issue. It has been bipartisan. The \nreason it has been bipartisan is because of whom the minimum wage \naffects. The fact is minimum wage workers are men and women of dignity. \nThey are hard workers. They are the men and women who clean out the \nbuildings for American commerce. They help and assist our \nschoolteachers in schools all over this country. They work in our \nnursing homes to provide help and assistance for the frail elderly, the \nelderly who have sacrificed so much for their own children and have \ndone so much to make this a great nation. Many of them are served by \nthe minimum wage.\n  First, these are men and women of dignity, working hard, more often \nthan not having two or even three jobs, trying to provide for their \nfamilies and having an increasingly difficult time to make any ends \nmeet, and we will get to that.\n  This issue primarily affects women because about 65 percent of all \nminimum wage workers are women. The majority of the women who earn the \nminimum wage have children. So it is a women's issue, it is a \nchildren's issue, and it is a family issue because we have families, \nheads of household in many instances, single moms or single dads, \ntrying to provide for their children, working one or two or even three \njobs, trying to make ends meet. So it is a women's issue because so \nmany of the minimum wage workers are women and a children's issue \nbecause those children's lives are affected by obviously the \ncircumstance of the one who is providing for them. It is a civil rights \nissue because so many of these jobs are open to men and women of color. \nSo it is a civil rights issue, a family issue, a women's issue, a \nchildren's issue, but most of all it is a fairness issue.\n  The American people understand fairness. They understand if someone \nis going to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, they should not \nhave to live in poverty. Republicans\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nhave understood that, Democratic Presidents have understood it, and I \ncannot for the life of me understand why our Republican friends on the \nother side of the aisle, when we have changed our increase in the \nminimum wage from $2.10 down to $1.10 over the next 2 years, refuse to \nbe willing to accept it.\n  What is it that they have against working poor people, men and women \nwho are trying to get the first rung on the economic ladder? What is it \nabout it that is so offensive to this body that we do not give them an \nincrease in the minimum wage and we give ourselves repeated increases? \nThat is the issue. And at 4:30 this afternoon, this institution will \nhave a chance to express itself.\n  The American people understand this. The American people understand \nthe minimum wage. There are a lot of complex issues, and men and women \nacross this country are working hard every single day. They have little \ntime to spend trying to figure out a lot of different kinds of \nchallenges, but they understand an increase in the minimum wage. They \nunderstand what difference this makes. They will have an opportunity to \nhear about it because this issue is not going away. No matter how this \nturns out this afternoon, the Senate, and most importantly the workers \nat the minimum wage, can be confident that I am going to continue to \nraise this as long as I am in the Senate. We will have an opportunity \nto vote on this repeatedly.\n  So we can find those of our colleagues who want to try and confuse \nthe issue all they want with 87 pages, but this is an increase in the \nminimum wage which consists of 2 pages. That is what the vote is for \nthis afternoon. Some of my colleagues want to rewrite the labor laws on \nthis. Fine, let us get to it. But why are we doing that on this \nparticular bill? Increase in the minimum wage, one can ask, why on this \nbill? Very simply, it was a good enough vehicle to increase the salary \nof the Members of Congress until yesterday when we neutralized it and \nit ought to be a good enough vehicle to provide some assistance to \nthose on the first rung of the economic ladder. That certainly makes \nsense to me. That is not what the Republican alternative is about.\n  So we have seen that this has been historically something Republicans \nand Democrats, when they are at their best, have supported. Over a \nperiod of years, we have seen what has happened on the issues of \nproductivity. We hear frequently that we cannot afford an increase in \nthe minimum wage unless we are going to have an increase of \nproductivity. It is an old economic argument we do not want to add to \ninflation, but if we have an increase in productivity, of course, then \nwe can consider an increase in the minimum wage because it will not \nhave an inflationary impact in terms of the economy.\n  All right. Let us take that argument and see what has happened in \nterms of productivity over the period of recent years. We have seen \nnow, over the period of the last 40 years, productivity has gone up 115 \npercent. Notice that going back into the 1950s, the 1960s, the 1970s, \nthe minimum wage and productivity lines were always intersecting \nbecause we kept the increase in the minimum wage and productivity \ntogether. That was an argument that was made. There is plausibility to \nit.\n  If that argument was good enough for the 30 or 40 years that we first \nhad the minimum wage, look what has happened in recent times. Workers \nhave increased their productivity 115 percent, but the minimum wage has \ndeclined some 31 percent. So one cannot say we cannot increase the \nminimum wage because we have not had an increase in productivity. So \nthis is certainly one of the factors.\n\n  This chart is enormously interesting because it shows that Americans' \nwork hours have increased more than any other industrial country in the \nworld. Look at this chart. This is an indication of the changes in \nhours worked per person over the period of 1970 to the year 2002. \nActually, in a number of the countries in Western Europe, the percent \nhas gone down, but we have seen in Australia, Canada, and most of all \nin the United States, it has gone up. Americans are working longer, \nthey are working harder, they are producing more, and one would think \nthat their paychecks would reflect it, at least at the lower economic \nend, or in all areas it ought to reflect it, but, no, it does not work \nthat way. We refuse to give that kind of a recognition.\n  Unfortunately, when the President was asked about the challenges that \npeople working for the minimum wage face, the individual conversation \nbetween the President and Ms. Mornin, who is a single mother of three, \none of whom is disabled, Ms. Mornin said this was on February 4, 2005, \nin the Omaha Arena in Omaha, NE--I work three jobs and I feel like I \ncontribute.\n  President Bush: You work three jobs?\n  Ms. Mornin: Three jobs.\n  President Bush: Uniquely American, isn't it? I mean, that is \nfantastic that you're doing that. Get any sleep? (Laughter.)\n  That is an indication that there are people in this city who just do \nnot understand what is happening to people who are earning the minimum \nwage level. They are not getting any kind of recognition. People do not \nunderstand what their particular challenge is, but they ought to. I \nthink more Americans do today than they did several months ago.\n  One of the most moving covers of any magazine was this September 19 \ncover of Newsweek. It shows a child with tears on her face: Poverty, \nrace, Katrina, lessons of a national shame.\n  In this rather extensive article about the enormous tragedy that took \nplace in the gulf and in New Orleans, it talks about the other America: \nAn enduring shame Katrina reminded us, but the problem is not new. Why \na rising tide of people live in poverty, who they are, and what we can \ndo about it.\n  There are the striking photos of people who were left out and left \nbehind. The whole article is about hard-working individuals in that \nregion of the country down in Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana. \nSuddenly, the Nation was focused on their particular plight because \nwhen the floods came to New Orleans, we saw the tragic circumstances \nthat they were subject to, the lack of preparation, the lack of \norganization, and the lack of outreach to them for so many days. These \npeople are still struggling. Along the gulf coast, many of those \ncommunities were absolutely obliterated.\n  I had the opportunity, with several of my colleagues, to visit those \nareas 3 weeks ago or so and to meet a number of the individuals, not \nthe particular persons who are outlined in this article but individuals \nwhose lives were absolutely the same. We find so many of our fellow \nAmericans who are living in poverty. We find increasing numbers of \nAmericans living in poverty. There are 5 million more people living in \npoverty. I have a chart that shows it, but it certainly does not tell \nthe story that one sees when they visit the gulf area and visit New \nOrleans and meet some of these families or even visit with them.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts at the Otis Base, where we had \nseveral hundred of the evacuees who came there, many of them rescued \nvery late in the whole process because they had remained in their \nhomes, some of them trying to help elderly and disabled people, and \nmore than half of whom had arrived at Otis still in their damp and wet \nclothes, and they received an enormously generous and warm welcome, \nwhich they have expressed to our fellow citizens in Massachusetts.\n  Their stories and their lives are stories of lost hope, lost homes, \nlost jobs, lost health insurance, lost every aspect, tangible aspects \nof their lives, separated families, and lost everything but their faith \nand a sense of hope, a desire to try and get back on their feet. I ask, \nHow in the world is someone going to get back on their feet when they \nare getting paid $5.15 an hour? How are they going to get back on their \nfeet?\n  All they have to do is read through this magazine and read the life \nstories of these individuals who work and struggle in two and three \ndifferent jobs. There is the case of Delores Ellis: Before Katrina \nturned her world upside down, this 51-year-old resident of New Orleans' \nNinth Ward was earning the highest salary of her life as a school \njanitor, $6.50 an hour, no health insurance, no pension, and then she \nbounced around minimum wage jobs.\n  Ellis said: I worked hard all my life. I cannot afford nothing. I am \nnot saying that I want to keep up with the Joneses, but I just want to \nlive better.\n  Well, one of the ways that she can live better is an increase in the \nminimum wage. We cannot solve all of her\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n\nproblems, but we sure can provide some assistance by increasing her \nminimum wage. It is as simple as that.\n  Americans can understand that. ``What can we do?'' they say. Well, \nthere are a lot of things that have to be done. We cannot solve all of \nthe problems, but we have to start someplace, and we are starting with \nan increase in the minimum wage.\n  Here are the figures: 5.4 million more Americans in poverty over the \nperiod of the last 4 years. This is a fierce indictment, and we are \ngoing to see these figures have even expanded as a result of the \nterrible effects from Katrina.\n  This is what has happened. As we look over history, we see at other \ntimes and other Congresses, when Congresses were controlled by \nRepublicans and Democrats--look here, from 1960 all the way through \n1980, we have the minimum wage effectively at the poverty level. This \nis in constant dollars. This was over a period of some 30 years, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. We say if you work hard, want to work \nand work hard, you are not going to have to live in poverty here in the \nUnited States.\n  Look what has happened in recent years. Here were the last two \nincreases we had in the minimum wage and here is the collapse again of \nthe minimum wage in terms of its purchasing power.\n  What did our brothers and sisters in the Congress, what did \nRepublicans and Democrats know then, over a 30- or 40-year period, that \nwe do not understand now? What is it, so that we are so unwilling to \nsee a bump, a small bump of an increase in the minimum wage?\n  Oh, no, we have an 85-page alternative, they will call it. This is an \nalternative filled with what we call poison pills, filled with taking \npeople out of coverage, filled with new changes in overtime legislation \nto limit people from receiving any overtime.\n  We know the importance of overtime to workers. Many of them use that \novertime pay they receive to put away to educate a child. Here we have \nan attempt to undermine overtime for workers.\n  An argument is sometimes made that we cannot afford a minimum wage \nbecause it will be an inflator in terms of our overall economy. Our \neconomy is somewhat uncertain at the present time, and therefore we \ncannot afford to have an increase in the minimum wage because it will \nhave an adverse impact in terms of our economy.\n  This is an interesting chart: Increasing the minimum wage to $6.25 is \nvital to workers but a drop in the bucket of the national payroll. All \nAmericans combined earn $5.7 trillion a year. A minimum wage increase \nto $6.25 would be less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the national \npayroll; one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  You say this is an inflator; if we increase this to $6.25, this is \ngoing to add to the problems of inflation we are facing. Here it is, it \nis less than one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  Look at what these working people are faced with. There is an \nincrease in cost of gas of 74 percent. You ask so many of those people \ndown in New Orleans why they were left trapped in New Orleans, and so \nmany will tell you they were trapped because they couldn't afford a car \nor they couldn't afford the gasoline to get out, and therefore they \nwere trapped. A number of them lost their lives. Others lost \neverything, because we have seen the increase in the cost of gasoline, \n74 percent; health insurance is out of sight for any of these families, \nup 59 percent; housing and rental gone up through the roof, and college \ntuition--it has gone up 35 percent, effectively eliminating those \npossibilities to so many.\n  Now over this coming winter here, we have now at the end of October a \nchance to raise the minimum wage $1.10, the figure the Republicans had \nsuggested last year. Here we have what is going to happen in our region \nof the country. In the colder region--not only the Northeast but in \nmany of the colder regions--we are going to see a 50-percent increase \nin the cost of natural gas for heating, we are going to get about a 27 \nto 30-percent increase in the cost of home heating oil, and about an \nincrease of 5 to 7 percent in the cost of electricity. Our part of the \ncountry uses 40 percent natural gas, 40 percent heating oil, and this \nis the rest. We see what is happening in the home heating oil.\n  Now we can say at least Congress is going to help some of these \nfamilies because they are going to recognize the explosion of these \ncosts of heating and keeping warm in these homes. In many instances it \nis as important as their prescription drugs and the food they eat. They \nare going to have to make some hard choices. This is the reality. We \nare saying at least give them $1.10. You are going to find out if any \nof the minimum wage workers, maybe working a couple of jobs and maybe \nwith a home up in New England--their heating bills are going to go up \n$600 or $800 or $900 over the course of the winter.\n  What is Congress doing? Basically it authorized the $5 billion to try \nto help provide some relief. We hear the explanation for the increase \nin these costs is because of what has happened to refineries in the \ngulf. That is an act of God. We couldn't control it. So those \nrefineries are down. Now we find out that the gas and heating oil have \ngone up and it is going to be particularly harmful to needy people, to \npoor people, to people earning the minimum wage.\n  Are we giving them any help and assistance? The answer is no to that. \nWe are not seeing any increase in the home heating oil program, the \nLIHEAP Program. We are not seeing any increase in that.\n  They are getting the short shrift every single way: No help and \nassistance in facing a cold winter, no help and assistance we can \nprovide by approving a $1.10 increase.\n  I see my friend from Iowa here on the floor. I want to point out to \nhim, as someone who has been such a strong supporter on these issues, \nhere is a two-page increase for the minimum wage in $1.10. Here is the \nRepublican alternative, 85 pages. It rewrites the whole of labor laws, \n85 pages. If you are going to be against it, why don't you just be \ncourageous enough to say no?\n  No, no, they want to say: Oh, no, we have a real alternative in here. \nWe are going to exclude a number of people who are covered with the \nminimum wage. That is where we are going to start, so they are not even \ngoing to get the $5.15 an hour. And we are going to make many people \nwork overtime and not get overtime pay. Oh, yes, we will do that.\n  You know what else, I say to Senator Harkin. There are provisions in \nhere that say if you are an employer and you effectively violate what \nthey call a paper report in here, you will get a nonmonetary fine. You \nwill get no monetary fine, even though that might be an oil spill, that \nmay be contaminated food. Why are we pulling that here in the Senate \nthis afternoon? What is it about it that we suddenly know so much about \nthat particular issue here on this particular legislation?\n  If you are going to be against $1.10, be against $1.10. But they have \nall of the other shenanigans in that legislation that are going to \nprovide additional short shrift for the neediest people.\n  I will be glad to yield some time to my friend and colleague from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member for his \nleadership on this issue and so many issues that affect working \nfamilies in America. Senator Kennedy has been trying for years to get \nsome measure of justice for the working poor in this country, trying to \nget the minimum wage raised. Senator Kennedy has been out here each of \nthe last 7 or 8 years trying to get this done. Every year the other \nside turns him back. But this year we cannot turn him back. We have to \nadopt this increase, this modest increase in the minimum wage.\n  We debated this amendment by Senator Kennedy last March on the \nbankruptcy bill, to raise the minimum wage. It failed on a largely \nparty-line vote 46 to 49.\n  We are back at it again. You would think after what we saw with \nHurricane Katrina, where the mask was ripped off of George Bush's \nAmerica, an America where the poor are out of sight and out of mind, \nyou would think that Katrina brought home to us that they are very much \npresent all over this country. By the poor, we don't mean those who are \njust not working, who are loafing or sloughing off; these are people \nwho work. They go to work every day. They work hard. They try to raise \ntheir families. Yet, our minimum wage law says they are only worth \n$5.15\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\nan hour, the same wage it was over 8 years ago. We have not raised it \nin 8 years.\n  Thirteen percent of our people are living in poverty. I say to my \nfriend from Massachusetts, there is always this talk about all the \npeople who got off of welfare in the last decade. They may have gotten \noff of welfare but they didn't get out of poverty. They are the working \npoor. They are working every day but they are not out of poverty. They \nmay be off of welfare but they are not out of poverty.\n  You would think those of us here in the Senate who have had our pay \nincreased several times over the last 8 years to adjust for the \nincreased cost of living would at least raise theirs. Right now minimum \nwage workers are earning $10,712 a year. I don't know if any of you \nhave ever read the book by Barbara Ehrenreich called ``Nickel and \nDimed,'' where she went out and tried to live on minimum wage jobs and \nwhat it was like. I commend it for your reading. It will give you an \nidea of what people go through as they try to work and raise their \nfamilies.\n  We keep hearing the age-old argument. I have heard it every time in \nthe last 30 years I have served in both the House and Senate every time \nthe minimum wage comes up: These are teenagers flipping hamburgers; \nnobody else makes that.\n  But we know what the facts are. Facts are stubborn things. We have a \nlot of doubt--don't trust me, trust your own Department of Labor. Trust \nthe one that is run downtown right now. Here is what they will tell \nyou: 35 percent of those earning the minimum wage are their family's \nsole breadwinner--35 percent. It doesn't sound like a teenager flipping \nburgers to me.\n  Sixty-one percent are women and one-third of those are raising \nchildren--61 percent of those are women. This is a women's issue, too, \nwhen you think about it. Most of them are stuck. Many of them are \nsingle parents. Many of them are not receiving child support, and they \nare doing their darnedest to raise their kids. They are working and \nthey are making $5.15 an hour.\n  Last March, when we voted on the Kennedy minimum wage increase, there \nwas talk that the Senate Finance Committee would move a markup of a \nwelfare reauthorization bill. I heard the words on the other side of \nthe aisle--let's not do it now; we will wait for welfare \nreauthorization. We have been waiting. There is no welfare \nreauthorization bill. There is none.\n  So now is the time to do it. We cannot wait any longer and neither \ncan the working poor. The minimum wage needs to be raised to a level \nthat is not just a subsistence wage but a wage that respects work, \nhonors work, and rewards work at a reasonable level.\n  Listen to this: Franklin Roosevelt, when we passed the first minimum \nwage law in the 1930s and Republicans were opposed to it--I assume that \ncomes as no surprise to anyone here--President Franklin Roosevelt said:\n\n       No business which depends for existence on paying less than \n     the living wages to its workers has any right to continue in \n     this country.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       By living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level. \n     I mean the wages of a decent living.\n\n  President Franklin Roosevelt had it right. America can do better than \nwhat we are doing right now, a poverty wage of $5.15 an hour.\n  Senator Kennedy went over some things I think bear repeating when you \nlook at what is happening.\n  I was in Iowa this weekend. What I am hearing more than anything else \nis the cost of natural gas prices, heating oil prices double. I heard \ntestimony from a man that his heating oil prices have doubled.\n  Low-income people have to go pay their heating bills.\n  There is another little quirk in the law. The Senator from \nMassachusetts mentioned the LIHEAP program. We need to put money in the \nLIHEAP program. There is a little quirk in the law that even I didn't \nknow about, and I have been working and supporting LIHEAP for all these \nyears. If you are cut off of your supply, you are then ineligible for \nLIHEAP. Imagine that.\n  Let us say you get heating oil. It is a deliverable commodity. It is \nnot like a natural gas pipeline. Let us say you can't pay your bills. \nYou have some bills left over, you can't pay them, and they refuse to \ndeliver heating oil to your home. You are not now eligible for LIHEAP. \nThat is right. You have to get the money upfront.\n  That is what we are trying to get, more money for LIHEAP. Yet the \nother side will not allow us to do so. I had testimony from a young \nmother who got LIHEAP in this past year. You hear these stories. They \ntear your heart out. She is a single mother with a small baby. She said \nbecause they ran out of money, she put her baby in the bathtub in the \nsmall bathroom with a space heater during the day. Then at night, she \nputs her baby in two snowsuits and covers her up hoping that they would \nbe warm all night as she put her in bed next to her.\n  Real people live this way. It is hard for some of us to imagine. Real \npeople live that way. They are making the minimum wage. That is what \nshe was making, minimum wage.\n  If you look at the price of gas, up 74 percent; health insurance, up \n59 percent; housing, up 44 percent; college tuition, up 35 percent, yet \nthe minimum wage is stuck where it was 8 years ago. Who can afford to \npay all of these increases? Obviously, if you are one of these big \ncorporate CEOs, here is where you are, up here. Here is where workers' \nwages and benefits are, down here.\n  Listen to this. I don't mean to pick on any one person. Mark Hurd \ntook over as CEO of Hewlett-Packard in March of this year. He may be a \nfine, decent person. I do not know. I am casting no aspersions on him. \nI am just talking about what he got: an employment agreement worth $20 \nmillion in cash, stock, and perks. Included in his pay package was a $2 \nmillion signing bonus, a $2.7 million cash relocation allowance, free \nhousing for a year, and a 4-year mortgage interest subsidy.\n  With housing costs up 44 percent in the last 4 years, imagine what it \nwould mean to a low-income family to have a year's worth of rent or \nmortgage-free housing. Imagine that. But Mr. Hurd, who got $20 million, \ngot that.\n  In 1999, Mercer Human Resources Consulting began tracking the proxy \nstatements of 100 major U.S. corporations. In 2004, according to \nMercer's survey, CEO bonuses rose 46.4 percent to a median of $1.14 \nmillion, the largest percentage gain and the highest level in the last \n5 years. CEOs in this study enjoyed median total direct compensation of \n$4,419,300 per year. That CEO compensation figure in excess of $4 \nmillion is 160 times the income of the average U.S. production worker \nlast year.\n  All we are asking for is a paltry $1.10 increase in the minimum wage. \nYou would think this would be adopted unanimously in the Senate.\n  So you can see the ``suits'' are taking care of themselves in our \nsociety. But the working poor, forget about it. They are left on the \nside of the road in the shadows.\n  President Bush in New Orleans after Katrina said: ``We should \nconfront poverty with bold action.''\n  Where is the bold action? Where is the strong voice in the White \nHouse asking this Congress to step up to the plate to increase the \nminimum wage and do what is right. You have just the opposite. We have \nthe White House supporting the Republicans in the Senate saying no to \nthis small increase in the minimum wage.\n  I think it is unconscionable. Have we in the Senate finally joined \nthe Neiman Marcus crowd? Have we become so totally insulated from real \nfamilies who shop at Wal-Mart and Kmart? Have we become so insulated \nfrom families who struggle to get by day after day that we can't even \nsee the necessity of raising the minimum wage $1.10 an hour? Is that \nwhat we have become? I certainly hope not.\n  I am sorry that somehow it becomes a partisan issue. It should not be \na partisan issue. I would have thought the other side would join and \nsay, yes, we have to do this together. We wouldn't be standing here \nhaving this debate.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment. It is the \nright thing to do. It is long overdue. I hope when people come to vote \nthey think of those families out there who have nowhere else to turn.\n  If we don't increase the minimum wage, they are going to be colder \nthis winter, they are going to be sicker, they are going to go to the \nemergency\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\nrooms, and we will pick up that tab, too. Their kids are going to be \nless healthy. They will not learn as well in school. Anxiety levels \nwill rise and families will disintegrate.\n  To me, raising the minimum wage is a small price to pay for domestic \ntranquility, to say to those 37 million Americans out there--as I said, \nmost of whom are women, many of whom raise families on the minimum \nwage--we can do better, and we have to do better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank my leader and \nmy colleague from Massachusetts, not only for today but for all of the \nbattles he has waged for so many years on behalf of basic justice and \nfairness for America's working families.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me this time. I \nthank him for his great leadership on this and many other issues of \nbasic justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from New \nYork may use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I find it almost hard to believe that we are on the \nfloor of the Senate arguing over the necessity for an increase in the \nminimum wage.\n  I am strongly supportive of Senator Kennedy's amendment, and proud to \ncosponsor it. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote \nin favor of it and to oppose the second-degree amendment.\n  This amendment does not go as far as I or Senator Kennedy and others \nwould have preferred. It raises the minimum wage to $6.25 an hour, far \nshort of the $7.25 an hour that Senator Kennedy and I and 48 other \nSenators proposed in March. But we could never get a vote on that. This \namendment, however, should have even greater support than the 50 \ncosponsors we had last March. It should pass unanimously out of this \nbody. Fifty Senators just last March supported an increase to $7.25. \nAnd now we have to cut the increase with a hope that we can get, No. 1, \nthe vote we are hoping to get on this appropriations bill, and, No. 2, \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan passage.\n  Since March, we have seen even more evidence as to why this is \ncritical. At a time when working families are struggling to make ends \nmeet, it is critically important that we do something.\n  Senator Kennedy has called this amendment a downpayment on what is \ntruly needed. Today, the Federal minimum wage is $5.15 an hour, an \namount that has not been increased since 1997.\n  Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the cost of living. Over \nthe past 3 months, according to the Federal Department of Labor, \ninflation has increased more rapidly than any time since early in 1990.\n  We also know the poverty rate is going back up. The fact is, there \nhas not been one net new private-sector job created in the last 4\\1/2\\ \nyears.\n  This chart, which should be a rebuke to all of us, shows that we now \nhave increased the number of people living in poverty. In 2000, we had \n31.6 million people, which was far too many. Now we are up 5.4 million. \nWhy? Because the economy is not creating jobs, and many of the jobs \nthat are in the economy are no longer paying wages that families can \nlive on and can work their way out of poverty.\n  We know everything else has gone up. Across America, people are \nspending 74 percent more on gas than they did at the beginning of 2001. \nHeating oil prices are expected to rise by more than 50 percent this \nwinter. Such rapid price increases will force consumers, especially \npoor working people, to cut spending on clothing, health care, and food \nso they can get to work and keep warm this winter.\n  These rising costs and falling wages are illustrated in this chart. \nWhere heating oil is going up dramatically, the buying power of the \nminimum wage is going down. Of course, we are in the post-Katrina \nphase, which, lest we forget, demonstrated in stark terms how so many \nAmericans live every day on the brink of economic disaster. Any setback \nbecomes a major obstacle to being able to pay for gas, pay for food, \npay for health care and prescription drugs, pay for tuition, pay for \nall of the necessities of life.\n\n  It is hard to stand with this amendment before the Senate and not \nwonder, when will the majority stop giving privileges to the already \nprivileged? At what point is it too much? Never has a political party \ngiven so much to so few who needed it so little. And it never ends. We \nare more than happy to continue to provide tax breaks for the \nwealthiest among us while we cut the social safety net, while we refuse \nto raise the minimum wage. Shame on us. At some point, there has to be \na recognition that we are tilting the scales dramatically against \naverage Americans. The middle-class wages are stagnant. Health care \ncosts are going up. The number of the uninsured is going up because \npeople who work hard for a living are no longer offered insurance or \ncannot afford to pay what it costs. Pensions and retirement security \nare at risk. There is something wrong with this picture.\n  With all due respect to those who have a different economic \nphilosophy, rich people did not make America great. I am all for rich \npeople. Ever since my husband got out of office and got into the \nprivate sector, I think it is great. I never knew how much the \nPresident really liked us; he cannot give us enough tax cuts. I have \nnothing against rich people; that is part of the American dream. But \nwith all due respect, it is not rich people who made America great. It \nis the vast American middle class. It is the upward mobility of people \nwho thought they could do better than their parents.\n  For more than 100 years, we have worked very hard to make sure the \ndeck was not stacked against the average American. Teddy Roosevelt \nunderstood that if we did not have a fair playing field, if people were \npermitted to monopolize capital and abuse labor, a lot of people would \nget rich, but the vast majority of Americans would never get ahead. So \nhe began to agitate for and accomplish making sure we had a fair \neconomic system.\n  As we moved through the 20th century, we saw adjustments made. \nFranklin Roosevelt understood that the hazards and vicissitudes of life \nstrike any of us and that a fair and just society tries to provide a \nlittle help so that people overwhelmed by circumstances often beyond \ntheir control would be able to keep going, raise their children, and \nplan for the future. We put in a lot of Government programs to make \nsure we had a balance of power, a balance of power between capital and \nlabor, between management and employees. And it worked very well.\n  The history of the economic prosperity of the American middle class \nin the 20th century is the greatest example of what can happen in a \ndemocracy where people's energies are freed so they can compete for \nthemselves but within a framework of rules. I am very proud of the \nprogress we made in the 20th century, and I am particularly proud of \nthe last 8 years of the 20th century where 22 million people were \nlifted out of poverty, where we raised the minimum wage, where we said \nto people: You have to work, but if you work, we will make sure you and \nyour children have a fair chance.\n  We have reversed that progress. It appears as though people are just \nsleepwalking through this Chamber and the Chamber on the other side of \nthe Capitol. Don't we see what is happening before our very eyes? We \nare undermining the American dream. We are making it nearly impossible \nfor people to believe that tomorrow will be better than today and \nyesterday.\n  These numbers speak for themselves. Look at this. The minimum wage no \nlonger even lifts a family out of poverty. You can go to work 40 hours \na week, you can clean the rooms and the toilets in a motel, you can \nserve the food in a restaurant, you can work in a small factory, you \ncan make that minimum wage, and you cannot even get your family out of \npoverty. What kind of message does that send? The whole idea of America \nis if you work hard and you play by the rules, you will be successful, \nyou will have a chance to do better.\n  Look at that chart. It speaks for itself. We have been on a steady \nslow decline. Even when we got a bipartisan agreement to raise it in \n1997, we still did not get above the Federal poverty line.\n  What message are we sending to millions of hard-working Americans? I \nrepresent a lot of them. I represent\n\n[[Page S11534]]\n\npeople who are working hard for a living. You see them on bicycles in \nManhattan delivering food. You see them doing all the hard work, the \njanitorial services at night. In upstate New York, I see them as they \nget up every day and go to work and believe that they are doing what \nthey should do. What message are we sending them? Too bad, keep \nworking. Don't expect anything from us. We are too busy giving tax cuts \nto the wealthiest of Americans.\n  That is a choice that will be made by this Senate. As far as I can \ntell, it will be a choice to vote against the minimum wage and to vote \ninstead for the second-degree amendment which is designed not only to \ndefeat Senator Kennedy's amendment but to do even more harm to the \npaychecks of working Americans.\n\n  This is what I don't understand. The second-degree amendment denies \nmore than 10 million workers the minimum wage, overtime, and equal pay \nrights by ending individual fair labor standards coverage and raising \nthe threshold for which a business would be held accountable to 1 \nmillion from 500,000. In short, and let's make no mistake about this, \nthe second-degree amendment would be the end of the 40-hour workweek. \nSo we can go right back to the end of the 19th century because that is \nwhere we are heading. There are those, bless their hearts, who believe \nAmerica was better off at the end of the 19th century, when you were \ntold what to do, and you had to do it, and you did not have much of a \nchoice about it. I don't agree with that. I am proud of the progress we \nmade in the 20th century, but I am absolutely convinced some people are \ntrying to head us right back there.\n  If it is the end of the 40-hour workweek and the end of the American \nweekend because there are no rules on overtime, that means a pay cut of \n$3,000 a year for the median-income earner and an $800 pay cut for \nthose earning minimum wage. Now employees are already free to offer \nmore flexible schedules under current law, but today if they come in \nand they tell an employee, ``Guess what, I need you this weekend, you \nare going to have to work'', they have to offer overtime when the work \nis more than 40 hours a week. The second-degree amendment would \nundermine that basic protection. So instead of making it easier for \nfamilies to spend time together, we basically are going to tell workers \nthat they have to do whatever they are told at risk of losing their job \nwithout any overtime pay or any other compensation.\n  The second-degree amendment also prohibits States from providing \nstronger wage protections than the Federal standard for employees such \nas waiters and waitresses who rely on tips. The amendment removes \nagency discretion and creates a safe haven for violators of a broad \nrange of consumer, environmental, and labor protections by prohibiting \nFederal agencies from assessing civil fines for most first-time \nreporting violations and preempts States' abilities to enforce these \nlaws.\n  In my State, we happen to think that some of those rules need to be \nenforced. James Madison said in the Federalist: If men were angels, \nthere would be no need for a government. But we aren't, and we never \nwill be, not on this Earth. The job of government is to help level that \nplaying field, help right that balance. Otherwise, people are powerless \nto defend themselves, especially when they have to get up every day and \ngo to work to keep body and soul together and food on the table, \nparticularly if they are single parents trying to make do on minimum \nwage.\n  It is disheartening. We could have had an up-or-down vote on the \nminimum wage. If you want to vote against the minimum wage, vote \nagainst the minimum wage. But to introduce a second-degree amendment \nloaded with poison pills that are against workers, that are against \nfairness, that speaks louder than any words I could say in this Senate.\n  There will be a day of reckoning. We cannot continue to tilt the \nscales against the vast majority of Americans and not be held \naccountable in the political process. The mask has been ripped off of \ncompassionate conservatism, and people see it for what it is--partisan \npolitics to favor the rich. If that is what we are going to be fighting \nagainst in this Senate, I guess bring it on, because on that fight the \nvast majority of Americans, regardless of what party they claim, are on \nthe same side. They want to make sure the deck is not stacked against \nthem, that they have a fair chance to compete, and that their labor \ngets a fair return.\n  I hope our colleagues will rally in support of Senator Kennedy's \namendment and vote against the second-degree amendment. We should pass \nan increase in the minimum wage, and it should not come at the cost of \ndenying basic rights to millions of Americans and turning the clock \nback to the 19th century, which is what it would do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the Senator such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as we speak in the Senate, sometimes we are \ncaught up in hyperbole. I am certainly afraid that has been the case on \nthe other side as they try to describe flextime. To say this is a \nreturn to the 19th century is a unique view of something which all \nFederal employees have the right to do today, which is to exercise \nflextime.\n  Why is flextime allowed for Federal employees? Because there are a \nlot of people who work in the Federal Government who would like to have \nthe opportunity, if somebody in their family, for example, is getting \nmarried, to be able to restructure their workweek so that one week they \nwill work more hours, and the next week, maybe the week their daughter \nor son is getting married, they work fewer hours so they can \nparticipate in the excitement of planning for that wedding.\n  There are a lot of people in the Federal Government who, when one of \ntheir family members, unfortunately, gets very sick and has to go in \nfor an operation, want to be able to be with that loved one during that \ntime of tremendous trauma. They want to be able to get to that hospital \nand not worry about not doing their job correctly at the same time. So \nthey seek the opportunity of flextime, too.\n  Then there are other people who work for the Federal Government who \nhave children who do exciting things. Maybe they are in plays. Maybe \nthey are in bands. Maybe they are good athletes and in sports. Maybe \nthey are not good athletes but sit on the bench, but they like to go to \nthose games, they like to go to those plays, they like to go to those \nband recitals. Maybe they are a fair distance away, so they want to \ndrive them, they want to take that extra Friday afternoon and take them \nout to that event because it is a big part of their life, a big part of \ntheir family, and they take advantage of flextime to do that so they do \nnot undermine their ability to do their job.\n  Is that the 19th century way we deal with employees? What an outrage \nto make a statement like that. Maybe the Senator from New York has some \nunique view of the 19th century that says that when you give a family \nmore time off to deal with family issues, that is counterproductive to \nhaving a strong family. Maybe we are not raising a village when we do \nthat, but I sure think we are encouraging the strength of the family \nwhen we do that for our Federal employees.\n  What are we suggesting here? We are suggesting the employer and \nemployee in the private sector have the right to reach the same \nagreement that the Federal employee has with the Federal Government; \nthat over a 2-week period, an employer and an employee, only with the \nconsent of the employee, only under a voluntary condition, without any \nmandate, and with significant safeguards so there cannot be any \ncoercion, that employee and that employer, if they decide it is to the \nbenefit of both of them to allow the employee to shift their workweek \nfrom a 40-hour week one week and a 40-hour workweek the next week to a \n50- or 45-hour week one week and a 30- or 35-hour week the next week or \nsomething in between, they will have the right to do that. It does not \nundermine the 40-hour workweek. It encourages more productivity, and it \ngives people more opportunity to be home, in most instances, to \nparticipate in important events, some of them unasked for, some \nundesired such as health issues, and some very exciting such as \nweddings or children doing special things in school. Or it may simply \nbe a young couple who wants to get away a little early some week in \norder\n\n[[Page S11535]]\n\nto enjoy the fact they are newly married. Or it could be any other \nmultiple of personal events that might occur that causes somebody to \nsay: I would like to work longer one week and less the next week so I \ncan take advantage of that.\n\n  How can the other side of the aisle, in good conscience, and with a \nstraight face, come to this floor and say that is some sort of coercive \nevent, that is some sort of event that undermines the right of \nindividuals and the labor force of America, especially when that right \nis given to all Federal employees and many State employees? The \nexaggeration is extraordinary. The hyperbole is excessive. The policy \nthey are suggesting is 19th century. They are saying: You are going to \nwork 40 hours this week, and you have to work 40 hours next week, and \nno matter how much you might not want to work under that structure, you \ncannot change because we know better than you know. I, the Senator from \nNew York, know better what the employees' workweek in New Hampshire \nshould be like. Or the Senator from New York knows better about the \nworkweek than the people of New York.\n  Well, I happen to think that allowing people to develop some \nopportunities to structure their workweek so they can better care for \ntheir family, better assist their family's lifestyle, have a better \nquality of life--doing it all in the context of protecting the rights \nof the worker so they are not asked to work any more hours, doing it \nall in the context of a voluntary program, doing it all in the context \nof allowing the employee to make the decision, not the employer--I \nhappen to think that is a pretty appropriate way to deal with \nsomebody's work in relation to their lifestyle. I think that is a 21st \ncentury approach.\n  I think the other side's proposal is a 19th century approach. Or \nmaybe that is too much hyperbole. Let me just say the other side's \napproach is misguided. I think our approach gives people the type of \nflexibility--that is why it is called flextime--in which most people \nwould like to have the opportunity to participate. This is a good \nproposal.\n  It is especially good because it comes in the context of being the \nessence of the debate now. The Senator from Massachusetts has adjusted \nhis amendment so the amount of increase in the minimum wage is \nessentially the same as the amount of the increase in Senator Enzi's \nbill. The issue of dollars relative to the wage increase is no longer a \nfactor. That is no longer a factor. The only thing we are really \ndebating about right now is giving small businesses some relief and \nallowing people flexibility in their workweek, which we give to all \nFederal employees, but for some reason the other side resists giving to \npeople who do not work for the Federal Government and who are subject \nto the 40-hour work rules.\n  So I must say, with respect to the other side, I find it disingenuous \nfor them to argue that it becomes a 19th century approach to say we \nwould like people who are in the private sector to have the same rights \nas people in the Federal sector. People in the private sector should \nhave the same rights as people in the State sectors. People in the \nprivate sector should have the right of their own volition, of their \nown initiative, protected by significant laws which avoid coercion, to \nchoose to work longer one week and less the next week so they can do \nthings such as participate in their family's lifestyle, whether it is a \nsoccer game, a wedding, or whether it would be, unfortunately, some \nmedical event, or anything else that is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, this amendment by the Senator from Wyoming is an \nexcellent amendment, and in the context of the debate, it is especially \nexcellent because, essentially, we are not fighting over increasing the \nminimum wage any longer in the two amendments. All we are fighting over \nis whether we are going to give small business a little more \nprotection, a little more right to be productive and therefore create \nmore jobs, whether we are going to give individuals the opportunity to \nhave more flexibility and a better lifestyle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my \ntime, to the extent I have any, to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have a question on time. How much time \nremains on either side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 24 minutes. The majority has \n76 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We have 24 minutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, may I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to follow the Senator from Illinois? I ask unanimous consent \nthat I can speak for 7 or 8 minutes following the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts controls the \ntime.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time to the Senator from \nConnecticut as he has requested in his request, following the Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be so recognized.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, America will not soon forget the images of \nHurricane Katrina, some of the poorest people in our country exposed to \nthe worst natural disaster in current memory. We watched that \ntelevision screen 24/7 and saw our fellow Americans struggling to \nsurvive, fighting the floodwaters, trying to keep their children and \ntheir families together.\n  America may not soon forget that image, but, sadly, many politicians \nin Washington have already forgotten. The poor people of New Orleans \nwho suffered--as those who did in Mississippi and Alabama--those poor \npeople were underwater long before Hurricane Katrina arrived. They were \nunderwater because they were submerged by poverty. They were submerged \nby a health care system that denies them basic health care protection. \nAnd, yes, they were underwater because if they got up and went to work \nevery single day, and worked 8 hours a day, the most they could hope \nfor under Federal law is $5.15 an hour.\n  It has been 8 years since we have raised the minimum wage. Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts has valiantly raised this issue every year, \nbegging the President to come forward and stand up for those poor, \nvulnerable people in America. Today he asks for what is a modest \nincrease in the Federal minimum wage: 55 cents an hour within 6 months \nof enactment, and another 55 cents an hour 1 year later.\n  Not a single family with this increased minimum wage will really get \nout from under the burden of poverty. We know it. Take a look at what \nfamilies face today. Since 2001, the price of gasoline has gone up 74 \npercent. I think it is even higher. Health insurance, has gone up 59 \npercent, if you are lucky enough to have it. Housing has gone up 44 \npercent. College tuition has gone up 35 percent.\n  Yet when we come to the floor and ask for the most basic minimum wage \nincrease for the hardest working people in this country, we are told by \nthe Republican side of the aisle, no. No. They have forgotten the \nimages of Hurricane Katrina. If they ever experienced them, they have \nforgotten what it is like to have a limited amount of money to try to \nfeed and clothe and shelter a family. Mr. President, $5.15 an hour in \nthe United States of America? Why in the world are we even debating \nthis? For Senators to come to the floor and say: Well, we want to give \nemployers more flexibility on overtime--do you know what that means? It \nmeans denying workers overtime pay.\n  Do you know what their proposal is? If your employer comes to you and \nsays, ``Listen, the boss says you are going to work 50 hours this week \nand 30 hours next week,'' you put them together and it is 80 hours. No \novertime. ``I hope you enjoy a little more time with your family.'' \nReally? Fifty hours this week, 10 hours of overtime but not an extra \npenny in overtime pay. That is the Republican proposal. Great \n``flexibility.''\n  One of the Senators said that gives you more time to go to soccer \nmatches with your kids. Well, assuming you can afford the gasoline for \nyour car to get to that soccer match, you realize in your heart of \nhearts you are making less money than you would have made\n\n[[Page S11536]]\n\ntrying to make ends meet and keep your family together.\n  Let me tell you something else that troubles me, too. How many people \nare standing up on the Senate floor and talking about what is happening \nto corporate profits while workers' wages are suffering? Corporate \nprofits have gone up 105 percent, while basic workers' wages have gone \nup 3.2 percent. It just tells you that when it comes to providing some \nopportunity in this country, there is plenty of opportunity for those \nwith the highest levels of income. We give them the tax breaks and \nignore the working families struggling every single day to keep it \ntogether.\n  Senator Enzi of Wyoming is a good colleague. He and I have worked \ntogether on many good things, and I am happy to work with him in the \nfuture. I have to tell you, his amendment is a very bad idea. The Enzi \namendment would deny to more than 10 million workers across America the \nminimum wage, overtime pay, and equal pay rights. And, sadly, it would \nbe the death of the 40-hour workweek.\n  In the home I grew up in, we knew that the Good Lord gave us the \nSabbath. We knew that organized labor gave us the weekend, \nunderstanding that families would work hard Monday through Friday, and \nthey could spend time together on Saturday and Sunday. You will see the \nend of that weekend with the Enzi amendment. You will see workers \nplunged into extra hours of work without overtime pay, for a whole \nweek, and fewer hours the following week, and no overtime benefits.\n  That really cuts the heart out of opportunities for families across \nAmerica. We have to understand something very basic in this country. We \nare going to make some important decisions in the closing weeks of this \nsession. Will we remember the vulnerable people who were the victims of \nHurricane Katrina? Will we understand how many other families across \nAmerica are underwater today because they do not have health insurance, \nthey cannot afford gasoline? They are working 40 hours a week and \ncannot make ends meet. They are deep in credit card debt and cannot get \nout of it.\n\n  For once, wouldn't it be great if the Senate came together on a \nbipartisan basis to stand up for working families? The way to do that \nis to vote for the Kennedy amendment and to oppose the Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Martinez). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking our colleague from \nMassachusetts for, once again, offering this amendment. As he has \npointed out already, this is a pared-down version of what was offered \nbefore. It is hard to comprehend how anyone, let alone a family can \nmake ends meet on $5.15 an hour. How do you pay for housing, food, \nclothes and other staples?\n  I have often said--and it has been repeated by others--the best \nsocial program ever created was not by an act of Congress. It was not \ncreated by a regulation or rule. The best social program ever created \nwas a job. Think of all the benefits, the intangibles, that accrue as a \nresult of having a good-paying job.\n  Here we are saying to people: Work hard and make only $5.15 per hour. \nYou cannot even begin to provide for the basic needs of your own \nfamily.\n  What bothers me a great deal is how things have changed here in the \nSenate. In my 24 years in the Senate, I recall with great vividness the \nreal discussions we had. I won't bore my colleagues going back to the \nRoosevelt administration, although it is not insignificant to talk \nabout it. But just in more recent years, the minimum wage battles were \nnot battles. They were resolved in a bipartisan way. My colleague from \nMassachusetts can tell you chapter and verse how it was done.\n  What has happened to us? What is wrong with this Congress, in these \ndays, that we are incapable of raising the minimum wage to meet even \nthe level of inflation for poor people in this country? Increasing the \nminimum wage was never a divisive battle. That was done by almost \nunanimous consent. We would work it out, come up with an amount that we \ncould afford that made sense for people, and enact it.\n  These are familiar examples, as shown on this chart, going back to \nthe Roosevelt administration, when the minimum wage was enacted, going \nthrough the Clinton administration, where we were actually able to get \nthose kinds of agreements between Republicans and Democrats. And here \nwe are now, for the last 5 years, still battling over whether we can \nget a modest increase in the minimum wage.\n  I am really stunned by it. This increase of $1.10, gets you to $6.25. \nIt provides for some additional groceries and rent, 1 year of \nchildcare. That would be an additional $2,288 if we adopted the Kennedy \namendment.\n  There are so many examples that can be cited about what this means \nand what people are going through. The Senator from New York raised \nthis earlier. Senator Kennedy has, as well. This is that chart that \nshows where the minimum wage is. As shown here, this is the poverty \nline. The black line is the poverty line. We have been without these \nincreases in the minimum wage. People are literally staggering at the \nbottom with a little more than $12,000 a year. Here is the poverty \nline.\n  How do you explain to people, good people, what we are doing in this \nCongress when we cannot even get this number up even close to the \npoverty line for people to make ends meet? What has happened? This \nnever was a debate that caused great friction--to talk about making \nsure people out there working hard would be able to provide for their \nfamily. Now, we would turn around and say: You are not even going to \nget the kind of level of support that makes it possible to make ends \nmeet.\n  I would hope that, No. 1, we would adopt this amendment. Let's get \nback to the days when we were able to come to agreement on something \nthat would take people who are struggling and give them a chance to \nmake ends meet.\n  I have one more chart that highlights the importance of all of this. \nConsider what is going to happen as heating oil prices go up by more \nthan 30 percent. We are talking about the minimum wage actually going \ndown in excess of 8 percent in terms of its ability to help people make \nends meet. We have the Bush economic plan that is going to have rising \nenergy costs with a declining minimum wage. What in the world do we \nthink people are going to do? How are they going to make ends meet? How \ndoes that get done? What happened to compassionate conservatism? What \nhappened to the days of the first Bush administration, and the Reagan \nadministration as well, when we were able to come to agreement about \nthe minimum wage?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator very eloquently pointed out the fact that we \nhaven't seen an increase in the minimum wage in 9 years. Inflation has \neaten away from that $5.15 as costs and prices have gone up. Is the \nSenator aware of the increase in the minimum wage that has taken place, \nfor example, in Great Britain? They have the second most successful \neconomy in Europe; Ireland being No. 1. They were at $8.56 an hour. \nThis year they have gone to $8.85 an hour. Next year, in October, they \nwill likely go to $9.44 an hour. From 1999 to 2003, Great Britain has \nbrought more than 1.8 million children out of poverty. That is what has \nhappened in another economy that says that the increase in the minimum \nwage and providing at least a living wage for individuals is not \nadverse to the economy. It is important to an economy. And most \nimportantly, it has been crucial to lifting children out of poverty and \navoiding the kinds of circumstance that we have seen after Katrina.\n  Why is it that they can understand this and be so successful, and we, \n9 years later, are still on the floor of the Senate for an hour and a \nhalf, and I bet we will still be unwilling to provide an increase of \n$1.10 for some of the hardest working Americans?\n  Mr. DODD. In response, the Senator makes a very good point. We have a \ntendency to think about raising the minimum wage as being a cost to \nsociety. What the Senator from Massachusetts is pointing out is quite \nthe contrary. Raising the minimum wage is an overall benefit. In fact, \nthe Senator is absolutely correct. In Great Britain, in fact, in no \nsmall measure because they have actually raised the minimum wage, the \neconomy of that nation has improved. In the years since we have\n\n[[Page S11537]]\n\nnot increased the minimum wage in this country, we have watched \nmillions more of our fellow citizens fall into poverty. There is a \ndirect correlation. We now have some 13 million children in America \nliving in poverty. What is the 21st century going to offer if we are \nraising a generation of so many of our children living in poverty? \nOverall, 37 million Americans are living below the poverty level. In \nfact, more than 5 million Americans have fallen into poverty in the \nlast 5 years. In Great Britain, as the Senator points out, as a result \nof increasing the minimum wage, people have actually been lifted out of \npoverty and the economy of their country has improved.\n  What the Senator from Massachusetts is offering today is \nsubstantially less than proposals he made earlier. This increase would \nbe to $6.25, if we can get it approved. We ought to come together \naround this. What a great day it would be in America for the Senate, on \na bipartisan basis, to support this modest increase in the minimum \nwage.\n  With all due respect to my good friend from Wyoming, his amendment is \nsome 80 pages long. I suggest to my colleagues, in the hour you have \nleft before we vote, that you read this amendment carefully. I think \nyou will be stunned to discover the impact of this amendment.\n  I ask my friend from Massachusetts, on page 17 of the Enzi amendment, \ncorrect me if I am wrong, as I read line 7, subsection 5 of this \namendment, it says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no State may \n     impose a civil penalty on a small business concern, in the \n     case of a first-time violation by the small business concern \n     of a requirement regarding collection of information under \n     Federal law, in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of \n     this subsection.\n\n  That is a license, in my view, to go off and do anything, \nnotwithstanding any other provision of law. It could wipe out all other \nFederal laws. Do my colleagues know which laws are being eliminated, \nnotwithstanding any other provision of law? You could lie and cheat and \nsteal. Am I reading this correctly?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. Effectively, what this does is \npreempt all 50 States from being able to enforce any of the Federal \nlaws which they are mandated to enforce. I don't know where we get this \nidea. That could be on safe water, environmental, toxic substances. It \ncould be on oilspills. It could be on any other matter. They preempt \nthe States. Where is this idea coming from? Where did this idea come \nfrom? Preempt the States from any kind of enforcement, what in the \nworld has that to do with an increase in the minimum wage?\n  Mr. DODD. Again, we are looking at an 80 page amendment. This is only \none provision that I happened to read quickly. Do my colleagues know \nwhat they are voting for? It literally could wipe out all the Federal \nlaws that a State would have to protect its people. That is ridiculous. \nWith all due respect, this amendment ought to be defeated.\n  I know very little time remains. I urge my colleagues to consider \nthis modest request to increase the minimum wage and reject the Enzi \namendment. That amendment goes beyond raising the minimum wage and \nrequires far more work than we can do in a 1-hour debate. Its \nimplications may only be discovered weeks or months from now.\n  This ought to be rejected if for no other reason than I don't think \nwe even know all that is in it.\n  I urge adoption of the Kennedy amendment and the rejection of the \nEnzi amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need. I \nprobably need quite a bit because the problem with debate on the floor \nof the Senate is that we don't listen to each other. I have said a lot \nof times that in committee, we are a much more informal group when we \nare marking up things. Consequently, if there is a misunderstanding or \na disparity, we can get together and we can talk about it and we can \nfind out how people were wrong.\n  I am disappointed that we haven't talked about this. A lot of these \nhave been available before. But what the American people get to see is \nthe 20 percent of the stuff that we will not agree on and, worse than \nthat, probably 40 percent of the stuff that we don't want to listen to.\n  There have been some gross misstatements here. I want to start with \njust the last one, talking about allowing people to do whatever they \nwant without a fine. That is such a gross misstatement that I am really \ndisappointed in the opposition. I even heard the opposition say that \nthat would allow people to have oilspills. I don't know how oilspills \nfall in the category of a first-time paperwork collection. That is all \nit applies to. If a small business makes a mistake sending data to the \nGovernment, just data, just a form--they miss a little bit on the form \nor they miss the deadline slightly and they immediately correct it and \nit doesn't hurt anybody--that is all that provision does.\n  If you are a small businessman out there trying to comply with the \nthousands of pages we have in a whole bunch of different areas, and you \nmiss one paperwork deadline, you can be fined pretty severely. That is \npaperwork. That is not oilspills. That is not EPA. That is not any of \nthe other things. It is data collection. That is what the amendment \nsays, data collection. Read the whole amendment. If a small businessman \nmisses a deadline or makes a mistake on paperwork and it is correctable \nand it is corrected immediately and it doesn't harm any employee, then \nthey are not subject to the fine that time. That is a small concession \nto the small businessman, a very small concession.\n  On this whole bill, I am absolutely amazed. We are talking about the \nsame $1.10 increase on the Democratic side that we are talking about in \nmy amendment. There is no difference. Both of them provide for a $1.10 \nincrease over the same period of time. We are not talking about which \nside is going to put people in poverty. Obviously, there is no \nlistening from that side.\n  I have to be upset when it is claimed that apparently the minimum \nwage is the reason for Katrina. You can't go that far, folks. You \ncan't. There isn't a connection between the minimum wage and Katrina \nhappening. There isn't. Yes, there were people involved in that tragedy \nwho were at the minimum wage, just as there are people under the \nminimum wage across the whole United States. But there isn't a \nconnection with Katrina. It makes nice rhetoric. That is what we tend \nto do on the floor, make rhetoric. We ought to be making policy. What I \nhave here is good policy for small business.\n  I also heard some statements about how all the small businessmen are \nwealthy, and they do that on the backs of employees. First, they are \nnot all wealthy. Secondly, the implication that they are unethical to \nget that money is also not correct. There are small businesses out \nthere that wind up paying their employees more than they get, even if \nthe employee is on the minimum wage. There is no guarantee for the \nsmall business owner. We have to remember that.\n  I was surprised that the other side didn't say: Here is the chance to \nget the minimum wage increase and to help small business, not to harm \nemployees. There is nothing in here that harms employees.\n  Part of the rhetoric was, we are taking away the 40-hour workweek. \nNo, we are not. We are matching Federal employees' benefits to private \nemployee benefits. That is it. What the Federal employees are allowed \nto do, we say that all employees ought to be able to do. How is that \ntaking away overtime? Because it doesn't take away overtime from the \nFederal employees, so it also wouldn't take away overtime from the \nprivate employees. There is a provision in this amendment that says \nthere cannot be coercion. They talk about forcing people to work on the \nweekend. That provision says that it has to be in an agreement between \nthe employer and the employee. It truly is designed to be able to get \nthem in a position where, without losing any money, they can have some \nextra time at the time that they want to have it.\n  I mentioned before--obviously, nobody was listening--that where this \ncomes up the most is where there are Federal employees married to \nprivate employees. The Federal employee gets this special break where \nhe or she can rearrange their schedule so that they\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\nwork a little more one week and then they can get time off the next \nweek without any penalty. But the spouse who works in the same town but \nfor a private employer is told by Federal law: You can't have that \nbenefit.\n\n  That is wrong. Why can't we, after two decades of seeing that it \nworks for the Federal Government, believe that it might work for \nprivate business? If it doesn't work, I would be one of the first ones \nto move to get it out of there, but it is going to work. There is no \nindication it would not work.\n  I think if we sat down and talked about these proposals, there would \nbe some agreement on both sides of the aisle. It has become one of \nthose rhetoric things where we can appeal to the base by blasting the \nRepublicans for having any kind of a proposal, such as this, that would \nhelp small businessmen.\n  There are a lot of statements I ought to correct. One of them is 2 \npages versus 85 pages. Clearly, 85 pages versus 2 pages, but that is \nlike me trying to imply they have a Federal Tax Code idea and it is \njust send your money to the Federal Government. That would not be true. \nThat is what they are saying when they say 2 pages versus 85 pages.\n  I have additional pages because of the provisions I have talked with \nthe Democrats about and tried to nail down in a very clarified way so \nthere could not be those objections. It is a few pages to do six \ndifferent things for small business. That is not a lot. Small business \nis the one that takes the bump on this proposal. I am trying to smooth \nout the bump, not at the cost of the employee, but as a little bit of \nhelp to an employer. And it is offset. It is paid for. We are not \ndriving up the deficit by doing any of these things, but we are \nproviding a way for them to stay in business and provide an increased \nminimum wage for their employees.\n  I heard a comment that there were no net new jobs in the private \nsector in the last 4\\1/2\\ years. Overall, it could be a true statement. \nI don't know; I have not checked it. But I do know that in the small \nbusiness sector, there have been some huge net job increases.\n  Unemployment in the United States is about the same as it was. There \nhas been an increase in population. Those people have been employed. \nWhere have they been employed? In small businesses. We know that big \nbusiness lost employees. They keep downsizing. They call it \nrightsizing; I call it losing jobs. But the small business sector has \npicked up those jobs.\n  There are people out there generating ideas willing to take risk. \nAnybody out there who thinks if you have a small business all you do is \nopen the doors and make a lot of money is wrong. Talk to the small \nbusinessmen in your community. See how many of them in the middle of \nthe night sit straight up in bed and say: How do I meet payroll \ntomorrow? But they do, and they solve it, and one of the ways they \nusually do that is they don't pay themselves. Later, when they make \nsome more money, they may make up for what they lost in that period of \ntime. But talk about no flexibility, they do not have any flexibility; \nthey have to pay their employees. A lot of people who go into business \nfind out it is not the cakewalk they thought it would be.\n  When I was a small businessman we used to employ some extra people \nduring the slow time so we would have them during the time when we \nneeded them, during the back-to-school rush and the Christmas rush. We \nwere always a little bit disappointed after we paid them through the \nslow times, when we were not making the money, to then have them leave \nat the busy times or be sick at the busy times. We understand sick. \nPeople get sick. Sometimes as an owner we were sick, but that did not \nmean we could not come to work because we had to keep the business \nrunning.\n  Small business is different than big business. It runs on fewer \npeople. That is why we call it small business. The small business \npeople have to compensate different ways for themselves, meaning if \nthey are short an employee, the trip they were going to take, the \nmeeting they were going to go to, which could be to buy products for \nthe store, is canceled because somebody has to be there to run the \nstore to provide the customer service. That is how small business \nworks.\n  I can tell you, too, when you have a small business, the employees \nare more like family, and so they have insight into more of what is \nhappening in the company than they would in a big company. In a big \ncompany, if they know about their own department, it is probably a big \ndeal. In a small company, they know about the whole business. They \nprobably do things in the whole business and they know how tentative \nthe whole business is.\n  Talk to some of the small businessmen in your own community. Find out \nwhat kind of a ``wealthy'' life they live. You will find out most of \nwhat they earn they have to put back into the business to keep it \ngrowing.\n  Another significant part of what they earn they have to pay in taxes \nbecause the tax structure is set up so that most of what they make \nlooks as though it is personal wage, and that puts them in a very high \ntax bracket and they wind up paying that out.\n  Being in small business is not a cakewalk. When the Federal \nGovernment forces on them any new regulation, that causes problems.\n  I also heard a statement that the minimum wage increase only applied \nto one-tenth of 1 percent of the national payroll. That is another myth \nI need to address, because, again, having been in business, I know that \nwhen the minimum wage rises, it raises all wages. If you have somebody \nelse who is in a tier above the minimum wage, and you raise the minimum \nwage, you eliminate part of the tier. Nobody can do that in small \nbusiness because everybody knows what everybody makes. So you raise \nthat one and then you raise the one above that, and then you raise the \none above that.\n  We are not talking about an impact on one-tenth of 1 percent of the \nnational payroll. We are not just talking about those people at the \nbottom of the ladder; we are talking about most of the people in the \nUnited States.\n  I would like to give all of the people in the United States a pay \nraise. The problem with giving everybody a pay raise is that it has to \nbe paid for. Somebody has to pay that bill. It is not like the Federal \nGovernment. The employer out there, particularly the small \nbusinessman--well, even the big businessman--cannot print their own \nmoney, so they cannot run deficits very long or they are out of \nbusiness.\n  How will businesses go about paying for a raise in the minimum wage? \nLet's see, you can do it by having less people; but, that is people \nlosing jobs, and I don't know of a single small businessman out there \nwho likes to get rid of people. They feel for these people who work for \nthem. They know these people who work for them. And when they lay them \noff, they see the hurt in their eyes. In small businesses, it is the \nlittle guy who has to look them in the eye and say: I have to have one \nless employee because I am paying others more. In some businesses, when \nthere is a tight spot and the boss goes to them and says: ``Look, I \nhave this problem, I am not going to be able to make wages so I am \ngoing to have to let somebody go'', the people in the business will \noften say: ``In the short term, we will take a little less because we \nunderstand the problem; we don't want you to be forced to lay off \nanybody.''\n  That is not the option when the higher wage is mandated, there is no \nslack to get through a particularly hard time, even if it is a short \none. We are talking about the prospect of people losing jobs. That is, \nunfortunately, one way mandated, increased wages can be paid for. For \nevery businessman I know this would be the least preferable way to meet \nincreased cost, but it is certainly one of the possibilities.\n  Another possibility is that they can raise their prices. This almost \ncertainly will happen. Essentially, if we raise most of the wages in \nthe country, we are also going to raise most of the prices in the \ncountry just to cover the increase in the wage. If what I buy increases \nin cost, did I get a raise? Not really. So we can create these phony, \nfeel-good pay increases, but if they do not increase buying power, they \ndo not do anything.\n  What is another way that increases in the minimum wage can be for ? I \ncertainly don't like either of the two options I just noted. Another \nway to pay for wage increases is to have more productivity. We had one \nchart that\n\n[[Page S11539]]\n\nshowed that productivity has gone up. Some of those productivity gains \nhave arisen partly because we have mechanized more. Unfortunately such \nproductivity gains do not employ more people. It switches the way \nproducts are made and drives up productivity per person. But increases \nin productivity will help keep people around at higher wages.\n  The employees who are out there and are being creative and are \nlooking at their job and saying: ``There has to be a better way of \ndoing this'', and are coming up with improved ways of doing business \nusually get rewarded. They get more money.\n  I remember when I was going to college, I was taking a course in \nFortran. One of my friends worked at the May D & F Company. He did some \ninventory work for them. This is in the old days when you had to write \nyour program out by hand and then take it to a card punch operator. \nThey punched the cards for you, and then you would go over the huge \nmainframe, and run cards through that. When you got them back, you had \na bug list and you could rewrite lines so it would work. And the next \nday you get cards punched again. Eventually you get through the bugs \nand get this little simple thing done that today a child on a home \ncomputer could probably do in about, oh, 20 minutes. But we were amazed \nat the capacity, the productivity that this provided.\n  One of my fellow students figured out in doing inventory, that \ninstead of the 40-hour week he was putting in to accomplish the work, \nthat he could write a program, run it through the university computer \non class time, and do the same amount of work in 1 hour. Now here is \nwhere I was pleased with the company he worked for. They let him do \nthat and they paid him for 40 hours. He was thrilled. He is now a \nprogrammer.\n  What he did was increase his skill level and get paid more for it. \nThat is what we are talking about here. There are a lot of people who \nstart at minimum wage jobs. If they pay attention to the job, I bet \nthey are not at the minimum wage, for most of them, for more than a \nmonth, and then they get promoted. They get a pay raise, a real pay \nraise because they did not force the price up, they increased their \nproductivity.\n  I mentioned this morning that there is a fellow in Cheyenne, WY, who \nowns eight McDonald's. Some people try to suggest that working in food \nservice is a bad job, and we kind of run them down. We should never run \ndown any job that people do with their hands.\n  If you are like that small businessman--and I contend most small \nbusinessmen are that way--not trying to take advantage of their \nemployees, but trying to help their employees, these employees can go \nthrough a program and get not only a lot of increases in position, but \nthey can actually own a McDonald's--that's right, own it. The \nMcDonald's owner I referred to this morning has had three employees who \nstarted at minimum wage and who today own 20 McDonald's. That is the \nachievement of the American dream.\n  They did not achieve what they did because of the minimum wage. They \nachieved this success and advancement because they increased their \nskill level. That is the key. We have programs that help people \nincrease their skill level. I would be willing to bet that the Federal \nprograms to increase skill level are minimal compared to the business \nefforts to increase the skill level of their employees. That is how \nemployers increase and improve their business. They help their \nemployees. They do not beat up on their employees. They help their \nemployees.\n  The smaller the business, I am willing to bet, the more they help \ntheir employees. That is what we are talking about here--helping the \nemployees, helping them get higher skill levels.\n  We do have a Federal program--and I am hoping we can get it through \nthe Senate by unanimous consent or even with some limited debate, \nwhatever it takes and whatever will fit in this packed schedule between \nnow and Thanksgiving . There is some important legislation we need to \ndo. One of them is passing the Workforce Investment Act.\n  The Workforce Investment Act will provide for about 900,000 people a \nyear--a year--to be trained in higher skilled jobs.\n  That can be people who are unemployed or people who are employed but \ntrained to higher skilled jobs. I also would like to put in a little \nplug for Wyoming at this point. We are short of people. We are the \nleast populated State in the Nation. Previously, one of the reasons has \nbeen we did not have jobs. Now we have jobs. We do not have people to \noperate them. So we have started some special training programs in my \nstate so people can work in some of the mines. One might say, Oh, I do \nnot want to be in a mine. Mines are dirty and unsafe places. I want \neveryone to take a look at the record because there are rules with \nwhich they have to comply.\n  I once had a fellow from Japan, who worked for a newspaper, who was \nfascinated that I did not do national media, I guess, and he wondered \nif he could follow me for a day. I said he could follow me for a day if \nhe came to Wyoming and followed me for a day. His paper let him do \nthat. I also invited him to visit a mine.\n  He came, and we did one of our normal weekend things my wife and I do \nin Wyoming. We go back to Wyoming most weekends and we travel a \ndifferent part of Wyoming. We hit all the towns, no matter what size. \nOn that particular trip, we went to Wright, WY, Midwest, Edgerton, \nKaycee, and Buffalo, and we held town meetings. I met with schoolkids \nand businessmen in those places.\n  I remember the first town that we were in. I think I got to talk to \n115 kids at the school. I talked to about 30 businessmen. I had about \n40 people show up for a town meeting.\n  He said: You do not get to meet with many people.\n  I said: Take a look at the little brochure I gave you that outlined \nwhere we were going today and what the populations were.\n  He said: My goodness, you got to talk to 90 percent of the people.\n  I said: What size building would that take in Tokyo?\n  One advantage of being in Wyoming is we get to talk to most of the \ncitizens.\n  The next day, I did not go with him, but he went to one of our coal \nmines. We have 14 coal mines in Campbell County. I hope people will \ncome out and take a look at them. If you are using electricity, there \nis a good chance that you are using electricity from the coal mined in \nCampbell County, WY. It supplies a third of the coal in the Nation \nbecause it is considered clean coal. It does not have a lot of the \nchemicals in it. We send some to West Virginia. We send some to \nKentucky. We send it to most States. In those States, they mix it with \ntheir coal, and they meet the clean air standards. That is one of the \nreasons we mine so much coal.\n  He went through the mine, took a look at it, and looked at their \nsafety record. I was very pleased when I saw what he had written, which \nwas that he believed Wyoming had participatory democracy. Most States \ncannot do that because of the bigger populations. On the coal mining, \nhe said he expected it to be dirty and unsafe. He found that it was \nclean and safe.\n  Now, here is the real telling part of this story. The next year, he \nbrought his family to Wyoming. In Wyoming, we have Yellowstone Park, \nthe Grand Tetons National Park. We have the first national forest. We \nhave the first national monument, Devil's Tower. He brought his family \nto see the little towns he had visited and how far apart they were. He \nbrought them to a coal mine because he was impressed.\n  So come out and work in our coal mines. You can make $50,000 $60,000, \n$70,000, $80,000 a year.\n  For women, that would probably be a nontraditional job, but there are \na lot of women working in the mines. One of the reasons they can is \nbecause it is all huge heavy equipment that has all kinds of things on \nit that are ergonomic and that make it easy to operate. A woman can \ndrive a coal truck that I guess two of these trucks might fit in this \nchamber, but I doubt it. The wheels on those things are about 18 feet \ntall, which means they are 18 feet in diameter. It might fit in the \nroom this way. It is huge equipment. One would be fascinated to see it. \nWomen drive those, and they make the same wage as men. Of course, that \nis a Federal law, and it ought to be. That helps to get rid of some of \nthose disparities we have between what women make\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\nand men make. Sometimes it is taking nontraditional jobs like that. \nThese are good-paying jobs.\n  They used to be able to put out an application and then select from \nthose people who had experience on that kind of heavy equipment. They \ncould select the best operator for that piece of equipment. The world \nis changing. There are fewer people out there to take those jobs, so \nthey now will train someone to run this heavy equipment with no \nexperience.\n  There is one little catch for some people, and that is that they have \nto have a clean drug record. They have to be able to pass a drug test \nbecause they do not want people running over somebody with this huge \npiece of equipment.\n  We have some of those mines that have gone 2, 3, 4 years without a \nlost-time accident. No lost-time accident, let alone a death. How safe \nis that? Safer than most of the businesses in the United States.\n  Like I say, this equipment is designed so that it is easy to operate, \nit is air-conditioned. The person is inside the whole day. And they are \nhaving trouble getting employees at $50,000, $60,000, $70,000, $80,000 \na year.\n  We have a special training center in Casper, WY, for people who want \nto work in the oil industry. They will take completely untrained people \nand train them to work in the oil fields and have 100 percent placement \non the people who graduate from there. Again, the only catch is a clean \ndrug record, they must be able to pass a drug test. It is a \ngood living.\n\n  I am making the point that skills are important. If one does not have \nthe skills, there are ways to get the skills.\n  The only people who are poor are the people who do not have hope. \nNow, that is a quote from ``The World Is Flat'' by Thomas Friedman. The \nonly people who are poor are the people who do not have hope. In the \nUnited States, everyone should have hope. Everyone should be able to \nfind some way to increase their skill level and get a better job.\n  When I make those trips around Wyoming, I go to a lot of schools. I \ntalk to a lot of kids. They are making choices down in first and second \ngrade about what is going to happen to their employment capability. I \nam very pleased with the Wyoming kids. I believe they do an outstanding \njob. I have had an opportunity to work with some of the kids in the \nDistrict. The first year I was here, the school board learned when the \nfirst day of school opened that the roofs leaked. I do not think that \nwas a good time for the school board to figure that out, but that is \nwhat happened. They decided that since the high school students did not \nhave anyplace to go to school, that maybe we could take them as interns \non the Hill.\n  I agreed to take some. The first young lady I talked to, I said: What \ndo you want to be? She said: I want to be a doctor. I was pleased. This \nis a ninth grader. She has her goal set on being a doctor. I found out \nlater that day that she could not read. Now, what does one think the \nchances are of a ninth grader ever being a doctor if they can't read? \nIt is not going to happen probably. Well, instead of her working in my \noffice, I sent her to a literacy class. When we finished the \ninternship, I offered to pay her to go to the literacy class. She never \nshowed up. So I am pretty sure she is not a doctor anywhere.\n  Kids are making choices about what they can do with the decisions \nthey make. I am hoping they make good decisions. I am hoping they get \ninto science and math and work those skills through and make some good \ndecisions as they get into high school to learn where their talents \nlie.\n  I have had a person on my staff ever since I got here. Her name is \nKatherine McGuire. She used to be my legislative director. Now she \ndirects a committee I am on. Her college degree was in agriculture. Her \nparents did not have a ranch, so I was not sure about that. Then she \nwent on to get a master's degree in agricultural economics. I asked her \nhow that happened. She said: I got some really good advice when I was \nearly in high school from a teacher who said, Every one of you kids \nought to have something you can do with your hands because you can \nalways fall back on that. She took that advice. She looked at the \nagricultural field. She got a degree in that, and then she got an \nagricultural economics degree. She still has that fallback position. It \nis important for kids in the country to be thinking about things like \nthat.\n  There is not any job in the United States that is not needed. Some of \nthe ones that are hands-on are going to be the most needed. The way the \neconomy should work, those should be some of the highest paid.\n  I am reminded of a fellow who came to solve a little problem in a \nhouse where they were having a pipe leak. He climbed under the sink and \nworked for about 5 minutes and had it fixed.\n  When he got ready to leave, he said: That will be $75.\n  The owner of the home said: Seventy-five dollars? You only worked on \nthat for 5 minutes.\n  He said: Actually, for my time, I only charged you a nickel. The rest \nof that is for the knowledge I had of how to change that pipe.\n  So knowledge is worth something. Skills are worth something. Skills \nare the way one gets higher wages. We can impose any kind of a minimum \nwage, and what we do is drive up wages so that there has to be more \nmoney to cover that wage, which will probably come from higher prices, \nwhich wipe out the benefit of the wage.\n  Another argument that has been made, which I will refute, is that \nthis amendment is taking away overtime. There is no overtime taken away \nin this. We have flextime in it. Again, I want to repeat, that is the \nsame benefit the Federal Government employees get, and we are just \nextending exactly the same thing to private employees. If there is \nanybody in this place who thinks we are taking away from overtime, we \nshould not have given the Federal employees that disadvantage. Of \ncourse it is not a disadvantage. They do not get overtime taken away \nfrom them. They get to rearrange their schedule so that it helps them \nin times they want to take off.\n  It does have to be done in conjunction with the employer. The \nemployee and the employer have to agree. Right now, even if the \nemployee and the employer agree, in the private sector, it is illegal. \nIn the public sector, it is fine. So why would we object to extending \nto those small businessmen and particularly the people who work for \nthem the same opportunity a Federal employee has?\n  That covers a few of the misconceptions that I think we got from \nlistening to the last hour and a half of rhetoric about this issue. I \nam kind of surprised that they have not adopted this amendment and \ntaken credit with the small business community for helping out small \nbusinesses while they get the $1.10 increase in minimum wage that both \nof us are talking about. Both bills have the $1.10, the same amount of \nraise, the same time period. So all we are talking about is whether, in \naddition to giving small businesses help, we also help the small \nbusinesses to be able to afford it, be able to put some cushion in \nthere so they can pay this increase in the minimum wage and the \nincrease that will go to all of their other employees because one does \nnot just raise the bottom wage; it forces the next tier up to get a \nraise and the tier above that to get a raise. So virtually everybody is \ngetting a raise. I know I always had to do that when I was in business. \nI do not know of any other employer who is not faced with the same \nsituation. So we are not just talking about that minimum wage earner, \nwe are talking about many more people.\n  Let me run through the six basic things we are providing. The first \none is updating the small business exemption. Small business generates \n70 percent of new jobs. Right now, the small business exemption covers \nbusinesses that gross less than half a million dollars. When was that \nlaw put into effect? It was in 1960. There has been no update or change \nsince that time. Has there been any inflation during that amount of \ntime? I think so. In fact, if we were doing the adjustment according to \nwages, that would be over $1.5 million--not half a million but $1.5 \nmillion. So what did I do? I compromised on that one. I should have \ngone for the whole $1.5 million. If I hadn't thought the other side of \nthe aisle was going to be upset over adjusting to inflation, I would \nhave gone the whole $1.5 million, but I did not. I tried to be \nreasonable on this one. I went in between the two. Like I say, it has\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\nbeen awhile since we readjusted that threshold and the economy has \nundergone some dramatic shifts and the way work has been done in this \ncountry has changed forever.\n\n  My amendment also incorporates some bipartisan technical corrections \nthat were originally proposed in 1990 by the then Small Business \nCommittee chairman. This is very important. The Senate at that time had \na majority of Democrats, so the Small Business Committee chairman was a \nDemocrat. That chairman was Dale Bumpers, who was in the Senate when I \ngot here.\n  The same thing was cosponsored over the years by Senator Reid of \nNevada, Senator Harkin of Iowa, Senator Pryor of Arkansas, Senator \nMikulski of Maryland, Senator Baucus of Montana, and Senator Kohl of \nWisconsin.\n  There were many others, too. All that I named were the Democrats who \nthought that these technical corrections could be useful to small \nbusiness. So I hope those Senators who are still here would vote for \nthat.\n  As those Senators can attest, the Department of Labor disregarded the \nwill of Congress and interpreted the existing small business threshold \nto have little or no meaning. The Department is misreading the clear \nlanguage of the statute. This amendment corrects the problem by stating \nclearly that the wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act apply to employees working for enterprises engaged in \ncommerce or engaged in production of goods for commerce.\n  My amendment also applies these wage-and-hour worker safeguards to \nhomework situations. That is very important.\n  The second thing it does is ensure procedural fairness for small \nbusiness. That is just commonsense, good Government legislation. \nSurely, we can all agree that small business owners, the individuals \nwho do the most to drive the economy forward, deserve a break the first \ntime they make an honest paperwork mistake; a first-time, honest, \npaperwork mistake, where no one is hurt and the mistake is corrected. \nThat is very limited.\n  The paperwork small businesses face is certainly not limited. \nPaperwork is practically unlimited for a small businessman. But this \namendment is very limited. Small business owners have told me over and \nover again how hard they try to comply with all the rules and \nregulations imposed on them, mostly by the Federal Government. As a \nformer owner of a small business, I know what they mean. Because I did \naccounting for small businesses, I know what they mean. I filled out a \nlot of that paperwork. I want you to know I got it right. I didn't have \nany first-time violations. But that is because I was supposed to know \nabout the kind of paperwork that I was doing, and I was being paid for \ntaking care of that. It is one way a small businessman can have a \nspecialist--they can hire an accountant to do some of the paperwork for \nthem. But for the most part, they do their own paperwork.\n  Yet for all that work, a Government inspector can fine a small \nbusiness owner for paperwork violations alone, even if the business has \na completely spotless record and the employer immediately corrects the \nunintentional mistake. Even the best intentioned employer can get \ncaught in the myriad of burdensome paperwork requirements imposed on \nthem by the Federal Government. The owners of small businesses are not \nasking to be excused from any obligations or regulations--although they \nwould probably like for us to do that, and it wouldn't hurt for us to \nhave a commission that would review all those things and see if anybody \nactually uses the paperwork that is required.\n  One of the forms I used to get to work on was an annual OSHA report. \nAnnually, they had to fill out a form that showed what accidents had \noccurred--lost-time accidents--and they had to post that in the break \nroom and they had to file it with the Federal Government.\n  Any time you have an accident or a near miss, it is good to sit down \nand talk to your employees about it, have them sit down and figure out \nhow it could have been avoided. That will save accidents and lives. It \nisn't the paperwork that saves the accidents and lives, it is actually \ntalking about it, timely talking about it, not a report that is filled \nout at the end of the year and stuck up on the bulletin board where \npeople may or may not read it.\n  Incidentally, I hope everybody will take a look at that form because \nit is not that readable. It is not that useful. It could be a lot more \nuseful. It actually could help prevent accidents. It doesn't.\n  It gets sent to the Federal Government. What do you think happens to \nthat form? Nothing useful. There could be a good use for it. We \nactually could compile that and find out, in the different industries, \nwhat sorts of things were happening and share that with those \nindustries. We do not do that. That is a wasted piece of paper. But if \nyou do not send it the first year you are in business and you have been \nworking like crazy to meet payroll and January 31 comes around and it \nis about the third of February and somebody says, Did you send in that \nOSHA report? Actually, I think that one goes the end of February, so it \nis the 1st or 2nd of March. They say, Did you send that in?\n  Oh, no, I didn't.\n  He can be fined for that, even though on the 4th of March he fills \nout the paperwork, posts it in the break room and sends it in and has, \nduring this whole year, been recording all of the accidents in a \nreadable form, talking to his employees about it, and solving the \nproblem.\n  Why should he be fined for that? Nobody is going to use it. But that \nis the kind of paperwork violations we are talking about. Remember, it \nis a Government inspector fining a small business owner for paperwork \nviolations alone--paperwork violations alone, not the oilspills that \nyou heard about earlier. That would not be a paperwork violation. That \nwould be a most definite violation, outside of paperwork. So they have \nto have a paperwork violation alone and the business has to have a \ncompletely spotless record and the employer has to immediately correct \nthe unintentional mistake.\n\n  Surely we ought to be able to give small business owners who are \ntrying their best a break on mistakes that don't hurt anyone. Even the \nbest intentioned employer can get caught in that myriad of paperwork \nrequirements.\n  They are not asking to be excused. What they are asking for is a \nbreak, if they have previously complied, they didn't hurt anybody, have \na completely spotless record, and they correct for the unintentional \nmistake.\n  One small businessman who I had testify before my committee a few \nyears ago when I was working on some of the OSHA things and I was a \nsubcommittee chairman of the Workforce Safety and Training Subcommittee \nof this same committee, he told Congress:\n\n       No matter how hard you try to make your business safe for \n     your employees, customers, neighbors and family members, in \n     the end, if a Government inspector wants you they can get \n     you. The Government cannot tell me that they care more for my \n     family's safety and my company's reputation than I do.\n\n  Small businessmen and women who are the first-time violators of \npaperwork regulations that don't hurt anyone deserve a break.\n  Let's talk about providing some regulatory relief for small business. \nYou can see these are not costly things I am talking about here. They \nshould not be controversial. They are pretty common sense. I think we \ncould sit down and draft a bill and probably agree on a lot of this \nstill if we had not polarized ourselves on the floor of the Senate \nfirst. It is one of the worst things we do, polarize things instead of \nwork them out. If we try to work them out, we can probably come to \nagreement on 80 percent of the issues. That is usually what we can do \nwhen we work things out together.\n  The third thing my amendment would do is provide regulatory relief \nfor small businesses. Any increase in the minimum wage places burdens \non small employers. It is only fair that we simultaneously address the \nongoing problem of agencies not fully complying with the congressional \ndirective that is contained within the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act. Under the law, agencies are required to \npublish Small Entity Compliance Guides for those rules that require a \nregulatory flexibility analysis. Unfortunately, agencies have either \nignored this requirement or, when they try to comply, they have not \ndone so fully or carefully. My amendment addresses this lapse by \nincluding specific revisions that the Government\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\nAccountability Office has suggested to improve the clarity of the \nCompliance Guides.\n  The Government Accountability Office suggested that we should clarify \nthe requirements; not change them, clarify them. It would force the \nFederal agencies to take into consideration the ways that they are \nharming small business by placing non-commonsense, confusing rules and \nregulations on them. It is a chance for the small businessman to say: \nIf you impose that, I don't see where it goes anywhere. I don't see \nwhere it does anything. Why would you impose that on me?\n  It is an opportunity for small businesses to respond when the Federal \nGovernment is about to change the way they do their business. And it is \na law that we passed. Congress said: You have to do this. You cannot \naffect small businesses without listening to them.\n  I ought to rephrase that. You can't affect small business unless you \npresent them an opportunity to speak. There is no requirement that the \nFederal Government listen. No matter what the small businessman says, \nthe agency that is affecting small business does not have to listen. \nThey have to accept the comments. But, currently, that law is not clear \nenough that they even accept the comments.\n  I have seen some documents that small business people have sent in to \nthe Federal Government about a problem with a law or regulation that \nthey were trying to comply with. The response they got was, ``No \nresponse necessary.''\n  I have no idea why ``no response necessary'' is a response. That \ndoesn't answer the question. Of course one of our problems is one-size-\nfits-all Government. We think we can sit in Washington and figure out a \nrule that will apply to the whole country and to every kind of a \nbusiness out there and every kind of a job that is out there. That is \negotism at its highest, I think. The businesses that are out there have \nconstructive comments to offer about ways to do things better. But you \nknow what? We don't let them contribute.\n  We vote on a lot of legislation that affects small businesses, and it \nis only right that they have some opportunity to express their thoughts \non how that is going to affect them and in many cases to suggest a \nbetter idea.\n  One of the reasons I go back to Wyoming most weekends is so that I \ncan go around and talk to those people who are doing real jobs. Often, \nwhen I talk to them, they say: ``I have got this little Federal \nrequirement that I have to meet and I don't understand it.'' Often, I \ndon't understand it either. But what I like to say is: ``What do you \nthink we ought to do about that?'' By golly, you wouldn't believe some \nof the commonsense, simple things they suggest that would achieve the \nsame Federal principle in a less complicated, straight-forward way. \nOften, the problem arises because we don't talk about the issue with \nthe people who are actually doing the work out there. There are a lot \nof people out there doing a good job, working hard, and trying to \nfigure out what in the heck it is we did in Washington. This is one \nsmall place where they are supposed to have input. We said: ``You are \nsupposed to get input.'' Actually, I would like for them to say not \nonly that you get input, but that the Federal Government has to listen \nas well. That should be the goal.\n  Let me move on to another one of the six small things that my \namendment calls for.\n  My amendment seeks removal of the barriers to flexible time \narrangements in the workplace. I have covered this a couple of times. I \nneed to cover it a couple more times because obviously the other side \nof the aisle doesn't understand what I am talking about yet. I will try \nit yet a different way.\n  What we are talking about is legislation that could have a monumental \nimpact on the lives of thousands of working men and women and families \nin America. The legislation would give employees greater flexibility in \nmeeting and balancing the demands of working families. The demand for \nfamily time is evident. Let me share with you some of the latest \nstatistics: Seventy percent of employees do not think there is a \nhealthy balance between their work and their personal life. Seventy \npercent of employees say the family is their most important priority. \nThe family time provision in my amendment addresses these concerns head \non. It gives the employee the option of flexing their schedules over a \n2-week period. In other words, employees would have 10 flexible hours \nthey could work in 1 week in order to take 10 hours off in the next \nweek.\n  Flexible work arrangements have long been available for employees of \nthe Federal Government. Government employees have been able to do this \nfor two decades, and no one has said: ``You took away the overtime \nright of Federal employees''.\n  The flex time program was so successful that in 1994 President \nClinton issued an Executive Order extending it to the parts of the \nFederal Government that had not yet had the benefit for the program. \nThat wasn't a Republican idea then. It might have been in the \nbeginning. But none of these things matter whether they are Republican \nideas or Democratic ideas.\n  It was a Democratic President who extended that benefit to all of the \nFederal Government and said:\n\n       Broad use of the flexible arrangement enables Federal \n     employees to better balance their work and family \n     responsibilities and increase employee effectiveness and job \n     satisfaction while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism.\n\n  That sounds pretty good to me. However, while employees in the \nFederal Government have these rights, employees working for a small \ncompany in Wyoming don't have the same rights. They may be married to \nsomebody in the Federal Government who has these rights and can \nrearrange their schedule to do things. But the spouse in the private \nsector and the employer in the private sector are not allowed to make a \nsimilar arrangement. That shouldn't ever happen in America. For years, \nFederal government employees have had these rights--rights that were \nextended by a Democrat President of the United States who noted: These \narrangements work, reduce turnover, and reduce absenteeism. How can you \nprovide these rights to Federal employees and not allow other people \nthe very same right?\n  I have heard some arguments that with flexible time arrangements \nemployees in the private sector would be forced to do things such as \nwork on a weekend. That is not correct. The bill specifically prohibits \nany coercion in making these flex time agreements. It has to be a \nmutual agreement between the employee and the employer.\n  Unlike the Federal Government, there are businesses out there that do \nwork on weekends. There are people out there who would like to be able \nto shift their schedule one week to the next without losing their pay, \nwithout having to take a day off, and they are willing to do that by \nworking a little bit more in one week and a little less in the next \nweek and having the funds they anticipated, similar to Federal \nemployees.\n  I don't understand how we can say that is wrong.\n  I couldn't agree more with former President Clinton. I did not agree \nwith him a lot, but that is one of the things he had right. Now we need \nto go further and extend this privilege to the private sector workers.\n  We know this legislation is not a total solution. We know there are \nmany other provisions under this 65-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act \nthat need our attention. But the flexible time provision is an \nimportant part of the solution. It gives employees a choice, the same \nchoice as Federal workers. If we are going to keep that from applying \nto the private sector, maybe we ought to take that away from the \nFederal employees so they can get their full rights.\n  Does anyone on the other side of the aisle really want to do that? Do \nyou want to see a revolution? It is the kind of revolution that small \nbusiness employees may soon provide as well, as they become aware that \nthey have been denied this benefit.\n  Mr. President, what is the remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coburn). The Senator from Wyoming has 18 \nminutes; the Senator from Massachusetts has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you. I still have two provisions that I need to run \nthrough, and I wanted to make sure I got underway on that before my \ntime expires.\n\n  The fifth provision in my amendment is extending the restaurant \nemployee\n\n[[Page S11543]]\n\ntip credit. The food service industry relies on what is called a tip \ncredit, which allows an employer to apply a portion of an employee's \ntip income--income they are getting on the job--against the employer's \nobligation to pay the minimum wage.\n  To protect the tipped employees, current law requires that a tip \ncredit cannot reduce an employee's wages below the required minimum \nwage. Employees report tips to the employer because the employer has to \nreport it. Tips that are earned are reported.\n  We have a few States that do not allow a tip credit. Increases in the \nFederal minimum wage would require raises for all affected employees in \nall States. Lack of a tip credit in some States could result in \nemployers having to give raises to what are often are their most highly \ncompensated employees--the tipped staff. As a result the nontipped \nemployees are negatively impacted by the mandated flow of scarce labor \ndollars to the tip positions. In addition, the employers in these \nStates are put at a competitive disadvantage with their colleagues and \nthe rest of the country that can allocate employee compensation in a \nmore equitable manner.\n  I must also note that my amendment clarifies that the tip credit \nprovision does not apply all parts of a State wage law. That argument \nthat was used the last time the tip credit was brought up. That is \nclarified in this amendment. That should not be an argument anymore. \nThe tip credit provision applies only in States that do not have a tip \ncredit; and, only to the minimum wage portion of that State's overall \nwage hour law.\n  The sixth and final provision in my amendment is one which provides \nsmall business tax relief. As I noted before, some of the people who \npay the most taxes in the United States are small business owners. Even \nthe money that business owners put back into the business to reinvest \nhas to have the taxes paid on it. That is at the highest tax rate in \nthe country. If we are going to impose even greater burdens on small \nbusinesses, we should give them some tax relief at the same time.\n  My amendment would extend small business expensing. It would simplify \ncash accounting methods that make it a little easier for them to do \ntheir accounting, and it would provide restaurant depreciation relief.\n  All of these tax provisions are fully offset. In total, the \nadditional provisions of my amendment are intended to mitigate the \nsmall business impact of a $1.10 increase in the minimum wage.\n  These steps are a partial way in which the cost of a minimum wage \nincrease can be addressed. They will help the businesses that must \nabsorb these increased costs. I share the view of many of my colleagues \nregarding such an increase on the Federal level. We must do our best to \nsoften the blow. This may be the best means to that end.\n  I would also encourage all of my colleagues to look at the true root \nof the problem of minimum wage workers, and that is minimum skills. We \nall share the same goal--I don't think anybody can deny that--and that \nis to help American workers find and keep well-paying jobs. I am even \ngoing beyond that. I hope they get to own their own businesses. We \nmust, however, realize that minimum skills--not minimum wages--is the \nproblem. Education and training will solve that problem and lead to the \nkind of increased wages and better jobs we all want to create for the \nNation's workers.\n  Let us work together to get that Workforce Investment Act passed, and \ngo to conference. We didn't get that done 2 years ago. Without the \nconference, those 900,000 people a year that could be getting paid a \nhigher amount are not. We need to get it passed and get it conferenced. \nWe need to get the President to sign it, and as a result, higher skills \nand training will be accelerated, and wages in this country will go up.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy and support my amendment that raises the wage by the same \namount, but then has additional provisions, that provides small \nbusiness benefits and soften the impact of the increases on the \nbusinesses that will have to pay them. If you are interested in small \nbusiness, you need to support my amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will use 3 minutes now.\n  I have listened to my good friend talk about the fact that Government \nworkers have some flextime and small businesses don't. Of course, the \nprincipal answer is that many of the Government employees have \nprotections. They have the Federation of Government Employees, they \nhave the Treasury Employees Union. AFSCME protects a great number of \nthem. They have different collective bargaining benefits. Their \ninterests can be protected. That is completely different from the \ncurrent situation.\n  Second, the Senator from Wyoming points out the pressures on small \nbusiness.\n  Look at this. States with higher minimum wages have more jobs in \nsmall businesses. This is the Commerce Department. This isn't just \ngeneral rhetoric. This is the Commerce Department. From 1998 to 2001, \n10 States and Washington, DC, with minimum wages higher than $5.15, had \nan employment rate of 4.8 percent. In the 40 States with minimum wage \nat $5.15, it was 3.3 percent.\n  This is the answer. We have seen it with the employment growth, that \nis, with the small businesses, which responds to the Senator's point \nwith regard to small business. States with higher minimum wages add \nmore retail jobs. Employment growth between January 1998 to 2004: 11 \nStates and Washington, DC, with minimum wages higher than $5.15, a \ngrowth of 6.1 percent; 39 States with $5.15, 1.9 percent.\n  The fact is we are talking about fairness. We had a wonderful \nexposition. I am always delighted to hear from my friend from Wyoming. \nI always value it and I always learn something. But I didn't learn much \nabout the minimum wage today. We are talking about the fact that every \nother time we have had a successful increase in the minimum wage, we \nhave expanded the coverage, except with the proposal we will have on \nthe floor of the Senate this afternoon with the Enzi proposal, which \nwill actually reduce the total numbers of people who are covered.\n  Let's get back to what this issue is all about. This issue is about \nfairness, about the fact in 9 years we have not increased the minimum \nwage. We have increased Members' salaries in here. I didn't hear those \nwho are opposed to our increase in the minimum wage out here speaking \nagainst the increase in Members' salaries. We have increased them 8 \ntimes for a total of $28,000. We have not hesitated to increase our \nsalaries, but now we are not going to increase the minimum wage for \nworking men and women who have not seen an increase in 9 years?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold my remaining 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has 12 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ENZI. Notify me when I have 3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ENZI. I will go through the GOP alternatives again. They ought to \nbe bipartisan alternatives. I am afraid in previous discussions they \ngot polarized in spite of changes to the extent that some god policy \ninitiatives that deserve bipartisan support will never have support \nfrom the other side. That would be a tragedy.\n  When the opposition says that my amendment does not have a minimum \nwage increase, I wonder what bill he is looking at. My bill has a $1.10 \nincrease over the same period of time as his, although I think he is \ngoing to make a small change to his bill because there is a slight \npaperwork problem--but since it is the first-time paperwork problem it \nprobably ought to be forgiven, just like my proposal would forgive \nsmall business first-time paperwork errors.\n  What we are talking about is six provisions that soften the blow of \nthe increased mandate on small businesses.\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\nFirst, permit family flextime for workers. Employees have the option of \nflexing their schedules over a 2-week period so they can work more \nhours 1 week and take hours off the next. The argument we have heard is \nthat we are cutting overtime pay.\n  If flextime is a pay cut, then Senator Kennedy and many of the Senate \nDemocrats have voted to inflict pay cuts on workers. If flextime is \nwrong, then so was former President Clinton in 1994 when he extended it \nto all Federal employees because it increased effectiveness and job \nsatisfaction and decreased turnover rates and absenteeism, the same \nthing it will do in the private sector. Why cannot somebody married to \na Federal employee have the same advantage the Federal employee has?\n  Second, it would increase small business exemptions from the Fair \nLabor Standards Act. We have had, since the 1960s, the small business \nexemption has applied to businesses with $500,000 in receipts. This \nexemption amount has lagged behind inflation. The small business \nexemption should be at about $1.5 million. We are only raising it to $1 \nmillion.\n  Every Federal labor law has a small business threshold. To the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, it was 15 employees. For the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, the threshold is 50 employees. Proponents minimum wage \nincreases assert it is necessary to adjust the minimum wage to account \nfor inflation. For the same reason, it only makes sense to adjust a \nsmall business threshold as well.\n  The real value adjusted for inflation of the small business exemption \nestablished in the 1960s exceeds $1.5 million. Senator Kennedy uses his \nbenchmark as the minimum wage rate for the same era. The Republican \nproposal is restrained and reasonable.\n  The third issue is relief for small business, one-time paperwork \nerrors. Small business people making paperwork errors would receive an \nautomatic forgiveness for the first mistake in paperwork matters. It \napplies only to routine administrative paperwork requirements imposed \non small business by the Federal Government. This is commonsense \nprotection for small businesses from the otherwise ``gotcha'' mentality \nof Government inspectors and only applies to businesses with spotless \nrecords who immediately correct the unintentional mistakes. My \namendment also gives small businesses regulatory relief by increasing \nfederal agencies compliance, review, and enforcement of the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. It requires better \ncompliance assistance for small businesses. Federal Government \nofficials have given too often short shrift to the existing requirement \nto solicit public compliance guidelines. The Republican package \nincludes specific provisions that the Government Accounting Office \nsuggested to improve the clarity of these requirements.\n  Another provision of my amendment relates to the minimum wage tip \ncredit for restaurant workers. This is so the restaurant can be sure \nall employees are being treated fairly, not just the high tip \nemployees.\n  We also have small business tax relief in the form of simplified cash \naccounting methods for small businesses. It will mean they do not have \nto see accountants as often. As an accountant, I think that is a good \nidea.\n  It gives quicker depreciation for restaurants, who are a major \nemployer for low skilled workers, and all of the tax provisions are \nfully offset.\n  The very modest tax cuts were targeted directly to businesses most \nlikely to have minimum wage workers. Remember that in spite of the \nrhetoric, this amendment increases the minimum wage in the same amount \nand on the same dates that Senator Kennedy's two-page proposal does. \nThe difference is that my amendment attempts to smooth some of the \nbumps for those employers who will be most adversely affected by the \nincrease.\n  These tax benefits will help small businesses that employ low-skills \nworkers survive without drastic cuts in employment. We are trying to \nhelp the small business so that they will be able to afford the \nincrease in the minimum wage. It is not an easy thing to come to the \nSenate and ask for a minimum wage increase. I am sure Senator Kennedy \nknows that. He has been working on it a long time. I appreciate he \ndropped it back to what the Republicans were asking for earlier and \nwhat we have in my proposal at the present time.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the remaining time.\n  Mr. President, we have had a good discussion. We did not have a \nchance to go through this excellent book, ``Raising the Floor,'' with \nthese heartrending stories happening in America every single day. Their \nrecommendation? Increasing the minimum wage, ending poverty as we know \nit. It talks about increasing the minimum wage.\n  I didn't have the chance to go through ``Communities in Crisis,'' the \nexcellent survey about the increase in hunger in the United States of \nAmerica. The one thing we know how to do in this country is grow crops. \nThe second thing we know how to do is deliver them. We know how to \ndeliver product. But the explosion in the numbers of hungry in this \ncountry, particularly among children--there is an increasing number of \nhomeless in our society, in all parts of our society. Talk to the \nvarious church groups about what is happening in every part of our \nNation.\n  This is not going to be the sole answer to it, but we have not \nincreased the minimum wage in 9 years. We have reached out to the \nRepublicans. We have accepted their figure of $1.10 over 2 years. Our \namendment is two pages long. Senator Enzi's amendment, with all \nrespect, is 87 pages and includes all kinds of things.\n\n  We believe this is the time. Fairness demands this. The American \npeople understand fairness. We are talking about men and women who work \n40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year. These are hard-working men and \nwomen who have a sense of pride and dignity in their work. They work \nhard, they try to provide for their children, they work one, two, or \nthree jobs. We have not increased the minimum wage now for 9 years. \nPrior to that time--the 50 years before this--it was bipartisan. \nPresident Bush 1 signed an increase in the minimum wage, Jerry Ford, \nPresident Nixon, Dwight Eisenhower, and now we have been 9 years \nwithout this kind of increase.\n  This demands fairness. It demands we give hard-working Americans, \nthose at the lower end of the economic ladder, on the first rung of the \neconomic ladder, working hard, an increase.\n  I remind all of our colleagues of that extraordinary Newsweek cover \ntalking about the other America. It talks about the problems of hunger, \nthe problems of homelessness, and the problems of people being left out \nand left behind. We can make a downpayment with an increase in the \nminimum wage. I hope we will do it this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2063, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have a consent request for a technical modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2063), as further modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       (a) Increase in the Minimum Wage.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6(a)(1) of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 206(a)(1)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) except as otherwise provided in this section, not \n     less than--\n       ``(A) $5.70 an hour, beginning 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of the Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and \n     Urban Development, the Judiciary, District of Columbia and \n     Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2006.\n       ``(B) $6.25 an hour, beginning 12 months after that date.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise to summarize my comments regarding the amendments \nand to urge my colleagues to cast a vote against the Kennedy amendment \nand in favor of the minimum wage amendment I have offered.\n  What is before the Senate are two amendments that raise the minimum \nwage by the same amount, $1.10 over 18 months. The difference between \nthe bills is that the Kennedy amendment, while raising the minimum wage \nthe same amount as my amendment, fails to acknowledge that any raise in \nthe minimum wage has some negative consequences on the employers, \nparticularly small employers, who must find\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\nthe means to pay for the increase. The fact is that a negative economic \nimpact on a small employer will probably result in a negative impact on \nthat small employer's employees. This is an important aspect. When you \ngive a pay increase, you have to find a way to pay for it.\n  My amendment recognizes that reality and provides some relief for \nthose employers. It should be borne in mind these employers, \nparticularly small employers, are the source of the vast majority of \njobs that are held by minimum wage workers. We have to continue to keep \nthese businesses viable and growing as a source of job creation. As I \nsaid before, I wish for the people working in those places to be the \nones owning the business, and I have shared some examples of how that \nhappens.\n  I ask that everyone bear in mind it is little solace to an individual \nearning minimum wage to learn that the minimum wage is increased but \nthat he or she no longer has a job at which she can now earn the higher \nwage, or that it is not worth anything anymore because inflation took \nit away.\n  It is for this reason my amendment contains not only the same \nincrease as Senator Kennedy's amendment but includes provisions \ndesigned to soften the blow and ensure that those most-affected \nbusinesses continue to create jobs and entry-level, low-skilled \nemployment opportunities.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy and to vote in favor of the more balanced and comprehensive \napproach to the minimum wage which is represented by my amendment.\n  I ask for a unanimous consent request that following the scheduled \nvotes at 4:30 the Senate proceed to the vote in relation to the motion \nto suspend the rules in relation to the Dorgan amendment No. 2078, with \nno amendment in order to the amendment prior to the vote; provided \nthere be 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote. I further ask \nthat Senator Dorgan be recognized for up to 5 minutes prior to the \nstart of the scheduled votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator has 3 minutes 17 seconds remaining on his allotted time.\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield back my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2078\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand my amendment has been ordered in a group of \nthree amendments to be voted on. I will take 5 minutes to explain this \namendment.\n  This amendment deals with the establishment of the creation of a \ncommittee in the Congress to investigate the waste, corruption, and \nabuse in contracting in Iraq and also contracting, in most cases, sole-\nsource contracts, no-bid contracts, by companies that have gotten \nbillions of dollars for reconstruction in Iraq, and now for \nreconstruction on the gulf coast.\n  Let me go through some headlines to explain my concerns. In 5 minutes \nI cannot do much more than headlines, but I have held seven hearings on \nthis subject now in the Policy Committee. ``No-bid contracts win \nKatrina work.'' That is the most recent one. ``White House uses \npractices criticized in Iraq rebuilding for hurricane-related jobs.''\n  ``Ex-Halliburton workers allege rampant waste.'' ``They say the firm \nmakes no effort to control costs, overspending taxpayer money in its \ncontract with the United States in Iraq and Kuwait.''\n  ``Halliburton faces criminal investigation.'' ``Pentagon probing \nalleged overcharges for Iraq fuel.''\n  ``Audit questions $1.4 billion in Halliburton bills.''\n  I mention Halliburton. It has nothing to do with the Vice President. \nEveryone says, Well, you are attacking the Vice President. He used to \nbe president of Halliburton, yes, but this is long after he was \ninvolved in Halliburton. The fact is this is about contracting abuse.\n  Let me go through a couple of the specific examples: New $85,000 \ntrucks paid for by the American taxpayers abandoned or torched by the \nside of the road in Iraq if they have a flat tire or a plugged fuel \npump. A case of Coca-Cola, $45.\n  They had gasoline delivered for twice the price that the folks who \nused to do the work in the Defense Energy Support Center said that \ngasoline could have been delivered for. Halliburton charged for 42,000 \nmeals served to soldiers every day, when they were serving 14,000 meals \nto soldiers. They missed it by 28,000--overcharging 28,000 meals a day.\n  There was the loss of $18.6 million worth of Government equipment in \nIraq that Halliburton was given to manage. There is also the leasing of \nSUVs. Listen to this, the leasing of SUVs for $7,500 a month. They \nordered 50,000 pounds of nails, and they came in the wrong size. They \nare laying in the sands of Iraq. It does not matter. The taxpayer picks \nup the cost. This is all cost-plus.\n  Do you want to buy some hand towels for the troops? The Halliburton \nbuyer who was to order the hand towels was told by his superiors, ``You \nhave to order hand towels with the company logo on them,'' which more \nthan doubled the price. It does not matter. The taxpayer is picking up \nthe tab for all of this. It is unbelievable waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Let me show one additional chart. This fellow shown in this picture \ntestified at one of our hearings. These are $100 bills, batched \ntogether with Saran Wrap. He said: We used to play football with them. \nHe said it was like the Old West. This is in Iraq. He said: We told \npeople, subcontractors and contractors, we pay by cash. Bring a bag. \nBring a bag. Here is the cash.\n  Now, for Hurricane Katrina, no-bid contracts once again. By the way, \nthe top civilian official at the Army Corps of Engineers said this: I \ncan unequivocally state that the abuse related to contracts awarded to \nHalliburton represents the most blatant and improper contract abuse I \nhave ever witnessed during the course of my professional career.\n  Do you know what happened to her? She lost her job. Why? For speaking \nout. You don't dare say these kinds of things.\n  I spoke this morning about contracting abuse with respect to \nHurricanes Katrina and Rita, the contracts down in the Gulf of Mexico. \nI will not go into that again except to say this: When the Government \nand FEMA pay a truck driver $15,000 to haul ice cubes from New York to \nMassachusetts--yes, New York to Massachusetts--where they are now in \nstorage, to provide relief to hurricane victims in Louisiana, somebody \nought to have their head examined.\n  Oh, the truck did go from New York, to Missouri, by mistake. FEMA \ndirected them to Missouri. Then they said: Oh, we want you to go to \nMaxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. He took those ice cubes to Alabama. \nHe sat there for 12 days, with hundreds of other trucks with food and \nclothing and ice and other things for victims--he sat there for 12 \ndays--and then they said: We want you to put this back in storage in \nMassachusetts. So the taxpayers paid this trucker--and there were \nhundreds of them--$15,000 for hauling ice for the relief of hurricane \nvictims in Louisiana, hauling that ice from New York to Massachusetts. \nOnce again, somebody ought to have their head examined.\n  My point is, I would like to see a congressional committee examine \nthis. This amendment would create a special committee. I hope my \ncolleagues will believe, as I do, this waste, fraud, and abuse is \nintolerable, and we ought to deal with it by investigative committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2063, As Further Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 2 minutes equally divided before \na vote in relation to the amendment offered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, minimum wage workers are men and women of \ndignity. They are predominantly women. They are women with children. So \nit is a children's issue, a women's issue. These people who earn the \nminimum wage are men and women of color. It is a civil rights issue. \nBut most of all, it is a fairness issue.\n  Over the period of these last 5 months, we have passed class action \nlegislation to provide special help and assistance to many of the \nlargest corporations in this country. We have\n\n[[Page S11546]]\n\npassed bankruptcy legislation to take care of the credit card \ncompanies. We passed an energy bill that will provide enormous bonuses \nto the oil companies.\n  We have an opportunity this afternoon to pass an increase in the \nminimum wage for workers who have not seen an increase in the minimum \nwage over the last 9 years. This is about fairness. Americans \nunderstand it. They have seen it on the cover of their magazines with \nHurricane Katrina. They know our fellow Americans need a helping hand. \nThis can be enormously helpful to those Americans.\n  Let's go ahead and pass it this afternoon.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to lend my strong support to the \namendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, of \nwhich I am proud to be an original cosponsor.\n  It is far past time that we increase the Federal minimum wage. The \nlast time Congress voted to increase the minimum wage was 9 years ago \nin 1996, and the last portion of this increase went into effect 8 years \nago, in 1997. Since that time, consumers have faced increased prices \nfor everything from food to clothing to housing to childcare. And in \nrecent months, gas prices have skyrocketed, and home heating costs are \nexpected to follow suit this winter.\n  And while prices have increased, the purchasing power of the current \nFederal minimum wage of $5.15 has decreased by nearly 20 percent. A \nminimum wage employee working 40 hours per week can expect to earn \n$10,712 per year--this is $4,500 below the poverty line for a family of \nthree.\n  Many minimum wage earners are struggling to provide for the basic \nneeds of themselves and their families. They cannot make ends meet on \n$10,712 per year. These are hard-working Americans who deserve a fair \nshake and who deserve a raise. Many work more than one job, sacrificing \ntime with their children just to scrape by. Without an increase, these \nworkers will continue to work long hours to support their families with \nlittle hope of saving for the future when they are barely able to \nafford the basic necessities of the present.\n  According to a recent report by the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities and the Economic Policy Institute, ``[t]he minimum wage now \nequals only 32 percent of the average wage for private sector, non-\nsupervisory workers. This is the lowest share since 1949.'' In other \nwords, the average minimum wage worker makes less than one-third of the \naverage nonsupervisory private sector worker.\n  I am concerned about the argument made by some who oppose this \namendment that most minimum wage workers are entry-level workers in \nfirst jobs who will advance their way out of these jobs and move on to \nbetter paying jobs. While that is certainly true for some workers, \nabout two-thirds of those who would benefit from this increase are \nadults, and one-third of them are the sole breadwinners for their \nfamilies.\n  I was proud to vote for the 1996-1997 increase that brought the \nminimum wage to its current $5.15, and I am pleased to be a cosponsor \nof legislation introduced by the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKennedy, that would increase the minimum wage to $7.25. The Economic \nPolicy Institute notes that such an increase would directly help more \nthan 7.3 million American workers. This increase will also help the \nchildren and other dependents of these workers potentially more than 15 \nmillion people.\n  Congress's inaction on this issue over the past several years has led \nto a growing grass-roots movement to increase the minimum wage at the \nstate level. A number of States have enacted increases over the past \nfew years, including Wisconsin. On June 1, 2005, the minimum wage for \nmost workers in my State was increased to $5.70 per hour. The Wisconsin \nDepartment of Workforce Development estimated that this increase would \nhelp between 100,000-150,000 workers in my State. While this increase \nrepresents a step forward for Wisconsin workers, more work still needs \nto be done to boost the purchasing power of these and other workers \naround our country.\n  The amendment that we are considering today would increase the \nminimum wage by $1.10 to $6.25 over the next 18 months. While this \nmodest increase will not go as far as I and many others in this body \nwould in supporting the hard-working Americans who badly need a raise, \nit is a long-overdue step in the right direction.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, would \nalso provide a $1.10 per hour increase in the Federal minimum wage. \nHowever, this amendment would also undermine low-income workers' \nstruggle to break the cycle of poverty by allowing employers to deny \nthese workers badly needed overtime pay through a so-called flex time \nscheme. This amendment, which is a total of 87 pages, also includes a \nnumber of other incentives for businesses that are intended to dampen \nthe opposition of business groups to even this modest $1.10 increase in \nthe Federal minimum wage. However, what these proposals would really do \nis continue the process of dismantling the 40-hour work week that was \ninitiated with the implementation of the administration's ill-conceived \novertime rule changes last year.\n  By the Senator from Wyoming's, Mr. Enzi, own admission, the committee \nwhich he chairs, the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, has not even considered many of these provisions. These \nprovisions should not be rolled into a proposal to increase the minimum \nwage. The need to increase the Federal minimum wage stands on its own \nmerit. And while I am certainly willing to consider a package of \nreforms for business, this is not the way to do it. Passage of such \nantiworker proposals should not be a condition of providing a much-\nneeded wage increase for the lowest income Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Enzi amendment and to support \nAmerican workers by voting for the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to voice my strong support for an \namendment offered by Senator Kennedy to raise the Federal minimum wage \nfrom its current, astonishingly low, rate of $5.15 an hour to $6.25 an \nhour.\n  An increase in the minimum wage is long overdue. Today, the real \nvalue of the minimum wage is more than $3.00 below what it was in \n1968--and at the lowest real rate in half a century. Since Congress \nlast acted to raise the minimum wage in 1996, its value has eroded by \n17 percent. This indifference is simply unacceptable. To have the same \npurchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be more \nthan $8.50 an hour. Yet nothing has been done, and the consequences of \nour inaction are very real and very painful to millions of Americans.\n  Since President Bush took office, the number of Americans living in \npoverty has increased by 5.3 million. Today, 37 million people live in \npoverty, including 13 million children.\n  Yet, despite the damage we do to our citizens and to our economy, \nthis body has been unwilling to increase the Federal minimum wage. We \nhad no problem passing a budget that gives tax cuts to millionaires and \ntrillion-dollar companies. Yet we have had tremendous problems ensuring \nthat hard-working Americans, Americans who work full time jobs and play \nby all the rules, won't have to live below the poverty line, won't have \nto decide between educating their children and feeding their family, \nwon't have to chose between heating their home and buying prescription \ndrugs.\n  It is time for us to get our priorities straight. Seven and a half \nmillion workers will directly benefit from a minimum wage increase. \nRaising the minimum wage to $6.25 an hour would give minimum wage \nearners an additional $2,288 a year--enough to pay for a community \ncollege degree. Congress should act now to pass a minimum wage increase \nthat makes up for our inexcusable failure to act in the past. I support \nSenator Kennedy's amendment to increase the Federal minimum wage, and I \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kennedy amendment. \nBoth amendments have the $1.10 minimum wage increase in them. But only \nmy amendment provides for some way to offset that mandate so that small \nbusinesses which employ minimum\n\n[[Page S11547]]\n\nwage workers can afford the minimum wage.\n  My colleague's amendment will harm small businesses' economic growth \nand job creation. It would raise the cost for small businesses without \nproviding any relief to soften the blow, forcing employers to make \ndifficult choices, such as raising prices, reducing employee benefits, \nor terminating employees.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment. My amendment protects \nsmall businesses' economic growth and job creation. As I said, they \nboth raise the minimum wage by $1.10, to $6.25, in two steps of 55 \ncents over 18 months.\n  My amendment recognizes and addresses the fact that all minimum wage \nincreases have certain costs. My amendment protects against the \nnegative impact of this wage hike on small businesses, the biggest \nsource of job creation. This proposal is responsible and reasonable and \ndesigned not to dislocate or unintentionally harm workers.\n  I ask you to support my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question now occurs on amendment No. 2063, as further modified, \noffered by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section \n425(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act that the amendment is an \nunfunded mandate.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Corzine) \nand the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) are necessarily absent.\n   I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nJersey (Mr. Corzine) would vote ``aye.''\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 257 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Obama\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Salazar\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Alexander\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Coleman\n     Collins\n     Cornyn\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dole\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Sununu\n     Talent\n     Thomas\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Corzine\n     Inouye\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote there are 47 yeas, the nays are \n51. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nSenator Kennedy's amendment to increase the Federal minimum wage to \n$6.25 an hour. I strongly support this amendment. Unfortunately, I was \ndelayed in arriving in Washington, DC, this afternoon. Had I been here, \nI would have voted yes.\n  An increase in the Federal minimum wage is long overdue.\n  It has now been over 8 year since the minimum wage was increased to \nits current level of $5.15 per hour. Since that last increase, \nCongress's failure to adjust the wage for inflation has reduced the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage to record low levels. In fact, \nafter accounting for the loss of real value due to inflation, the \npurchasing power of the minimum wage has not been this low since the \nwage increase of 1945.\n  When Congress acted to raise the minimum wage in 1996, the wage was \nraised from $4.75 to its current $5.15. At the time, this modest \nincrease had real results for American families. The adjustment \nincreased the take-home pay of nearly 10 million hard-working \nAmericans. But with inflation, the real dollar value of that increase \nis long gone.\n  So that we are clear, raising the minimum wage is a family issue. So \noften in this body we talk about family issues. This is our chance to \nact.\n  No family gets rich from earning the minimum wage. In fact, the \ncurrent minimum wage does not even lift a family out of poverty. A \nperson earning the current minimum wage, working 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks a year, earns only $10,700--nearly $4,000 below the poverty line \nfor a family of three.\n  Seven out of every 10 minimum wage workers are adults, and 40 percent \nof minimum wage workers are the sole breadwinners of their families. \nMoreover, a disproportionate number of minimum wage workers are women. \nSixty percent of minimum wage workers are women, and many are single \nmothers who must put food on the table, make rent payments, and provide \nchildcare. Increasing the minimum wage by a mere $1.10 per hour would \nprovide tangible help to these families in the form of groceries, rent, \nand the ability to pay rising energy costs.\n  I am proud that lawmakers in my State have recognized that the \nFederal minimum wage level simply is not adequate for a decent standard \nof living in high-cost States such as New Jersey. On October 1, the \nminimum wage in my State increased to $6.15, and on October 1, 2006, it \nwill increase again to $7.15. I know that this increase will have a \nmeaningful effect on people's lives: it means on average 15 months of \nchild care; over a year of tuition at a community college; 10 months of \nheat and electricity; 6 months of groceries; and 5 months of rent. It \nis estimated that the increase will directly benefit some 200,000 \nworkers.\n  But fair wages should not be guaranteed only to workers in a few \nStates. I support Senator Kennedy's amendment because I believe that \nall Americans should be entitled to a decent standard of living. \nUnfortunately, neither the current minimum wage, nor Senator Enzi's \namendment, can relieve the problems of low-income families in this \ncountry.\n  I support the Kennedy amendment because it seeks to provide a real-\nwage increase to workers that will help them keep up with the rising \ncost of living in our Nation. I strongly oppose the Enzi amendment \noffered by my Republican colleagues, because it is a cruel hoax on \nhard-working Americans.\n  It is politics over policy, and it is just plain wrong.\n  All of our hard-working families nationwide need and deserve a \nminimum wage that reflects the increased cost of living in America. It \nis the least we can do for people who work hard and make a positive \ncontribution to our great Nation.\n  I strongly support a raise in the minimum wage for the millions of \nAmericans who work so hard to support their families. We as Americans \ncan do better. We must act now.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2115\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 2115 offered by the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I make a point of order. The Senator is \nentitled to be heard and I think the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote for my \namendment,\n\n[[Page S11548]]\n\nwhich raises the minimum wage level by the same amount as the previous \namendment. The reason this amendment deserves your support whereas the \nlast one did not is that my amendment has some small business offsets \nthat will actually give them a chance to be able to pay the minimum \nwage increase without having to lay people off, without having to \naccept some other alternatives that would be very detrimental to \nemployees. This amendment helps the small business people that employ \nminimum wage workers by giving them some tax breaks which are all \noffset. This amendment also includes five other good policy initiatives \nwhich I have mentioned previously in great detail.\n  I would ask that you vote for this amendment and provide small \nbusinesses with the help they need to be able to afford a minimum wage \nincrease.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if you are interested in an increase in \nthe minimum wage, this is not the way to go. We offered an increase in \nthe minimum wage which was two pages. His amendment is 87 pages, and in \nthat 87 pages includes 3, at least, very important items that are going \nto shortchange American workers.\n  First, it changes the eligibility of those who are going to be \ncovered and eliminates 10 million workers who are covered today.\n  Secondly, it eliminates overtime. It is called flextime, but the \ndecision whether it is going to be flexible will be decided by the \nemployer, and therefore you are going to find that for the average \nworker in this country earning $44,000, $3,000 in overtime will be \neliminated.\n  Finally, this legislation effectively preempts 31 States that have a \ntip credit program. On page 21: Any State may not establish or enforce \ntheir tip credit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That will disadvantage workers in 31 States. This is the \nwrong amendment for American workers and it should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 425 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. ENZI.

It deals with an \nunderlying amendment that would establish an investigative committee to \ndeal with waste, fraud, and abuse dealing both with the country of Iraq \nand the reconstruction in Iraq, as well as reconstruction in Louisiana, \nMississippi, and in the gulf region following Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita.\n  I will not recite all of the examples of substantial abuse from sole-\nsource contracts, but it is dramatic. I believe very strongly, just as \nHarry Truman did back in the 1940s in uncovering substantial waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the Department of Defense at a time when a member \nof his own party occupied the White House, I believe this Congress \ndeserves good, strong oversight. We will get that with a special \ncommittee looking into this massive waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I would hope very much my colleagues would agree with me. If they \nbelieve we are spending too much, that there is waste, fraud, and abuse \nthat we ought to get after, they ought to be voting for this amendment \nand vote to suspend the rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern of my friend from \nNorth Dakota, who is a vigilant guardian of taxpayer dollars. I point \nout that the Armed Services Committee is doing work literally every day \nand every week on this issue. We also have Appropriations Committee \noversight on much of this, and I believe that under the existing \nstructure we have today, including the excellent leadership of our \nchairman and vice chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, that \nthis amendment is not necessary.\n  I understand the concern of the Senator from North Dakota. I just do \nnot believe it is necessary at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I also point out that there is a special \ninspector general overseeing all of these contracts. His name is Stuart \nBowen. He does an excellent job. He has been very aggressive in his \naudits and investigations. He regularly briefs all Members who are \ninterested, and he issues a report every quarter on his findings. So I \ndo believe we have an adequate structure in place, a needed structure \nto be sure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide that no funds may be used to provide assistance \n under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, to certain \n students at institutions of higher education, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Sec. 1__. (a) No assistance shall be provided under section \n     8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f) \n     to any individual who--\n       (1) is enrolled as a student at an institution of higher \n     education (as defined under section 102 of the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002));\n       (2) is under 24 years of age;\n       (3) is not a veteran;\n       (4) is unmarried;\n       (5) does not have a dependent child; and\n       (6) is not otherwise individually eligible, or has parents \n     who, individually or jointly, are not eligible, to receive \n     assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act \n     of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f).\n       (b) For purposes of determining the eligibility of a person \n     to receive assistance under section 8 of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f), any financial \n     assistance (in excess of amounts received for tuition) that \n     an individual receives under the Higher Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), from private sources, or an \n     institution of higher education (as defined under the Higher \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002), shall be considered \n     income to that individual.\n       (c) Not later than 30 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall issue final regulations to carry out the provisions of \n     this section.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in June of 2004, an article appeared in \nthe Des Moines Register outlining serious systemic abuses of the \nsection 8 program by a number of wealthy athletes at the University of \nIowa. For example, Brian Ferentz, a Hawkeye football player, was found \nto be living in subsidized housing despite the fact that his father, \nKirk Ferentz, lives in a million- dollar mansion in the same town and \nis paid $2 million a year to coach his team. To add insult to injury, \nBrian's scholarship actually included a $700-per-month stipend for \nhousing, yet he was living in section 8 housing.\n  After reading about this abuse, I immediately wrote to the Secretary \nof Housing and Urban Development, urging him to close this loophole, \nwhich was the unintended consequence of a 1995 regulation allowing \nstudents to qualify for section 8, in order to help people of modest \nmeans have a chance at an education and to better themselves. \nUnfortunately, HUD's response was far from adequate. HUD's solution \nallowed students who live away from home for just a year into the \nprogram, if their parents stopped claiming them on their taxes. It is a \npretty easy calculation to see that a simple deduction is worth less \nthan a year's rent, so it is easy for parents to decide to stop \nclaiming their otherwise dependant children in order to save money.\n  Fortunately, language was included in the final omnibus \nappropriations bill last year closing a little more of this loophole. \nIt said that if you get an athletic scholarship, anything above tuition \nshould be counted as income. Unfortunately, this doesn't go far enough. \nThis doesn't address people who are getting housing stipends from other \nkinds of scholarships, and doesn't address students whose millionaire \nparents decided not to claim them on their taxes, but have those kinds \nof resources available to them.\n  Recently, the Des Moines Register took another look at who is living \nin the notorious housing project that has housed so many student \nathletes in the past. The problem is still there, in full force, well \nover a year after my first letter to HUD. The Register's Lee Rood \nreported the following:\n\n       While other students foraged this month for new apartments, \n     at least three dozen Hawkeye athletes--many of whom receive \n     $6,560 annually for room and board as well as free tuition--\n     returned to one of the best low-rent housing deals in this \n     notoriously high-rent city: Pheasant Ridge Apartments.\n\n  It is time to solve this problem once and for all. These students are \ntaking up housing that is meant for truly needy people--people who \ntypically have to wait 2 years for housing assistance, despite the fact \nthat they may have the means to pay rent.\n\n  My amendment would simply require students' parental income to be \nconsidered in determining their eligibility unless they are independent \nstudents under the same qualifications that the Department of Education \nuses in their Free Application for Student Financial Aid. That is to \nsay, students' parental income would count against them unless they are \nover age 24, married, have kids, or are veterans. Further, it would \nrequire a student's scholarship above the cost of tuition to be counted \nas income.\n  Clearly, students who are truly needy should have access to section \n8. Help with housing often makes the difference between being able to \nget an education and not being able to make ends meet. However, kids \nwhose parents have the means to help them should not be living in this \nhousing. And if they are getting a housing stipend, some of it should \nactually be spent on housing. That's all I ask.\n  We cannot allow our system to be abused by people who take taxpayer \ndollars inappropriately, and then go off to sign multimillion-dollar \nNFL contracts. People who do need the help--including our most frail \nelderly, people with disabilities, and genuinely disadvantaged folks--\nare getting displaced. This has been going on for well over a year, and \ndespite pleas to HUD to fix this, the abuse has not stopped. There is \nno other way to put a quick end to this fraud. My amendment will end it \nwith the stroke of the President's pen.\n  This amendment will finally close all those loopholes.\n  I thank the manager of the bill and the ranking member for their \nconsideration. I urge acceptance of this amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we believe the amendment of the Senator from \nIowa makes good sense. It has been cleared on both sides. I believe it \ncan be agreed to by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment? If not, \nthe question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\n[[Page S11550]]\n\n  The amendment (No. 2076) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have a number of amendments which have \nbeen cleared on both sides. We propose to bring them up individually \nand ask for their immediate consideration and a voice vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent to set aside any pending amendments in order \nto offer those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2070\n\n  Mr. BOND. First, I call up amendment 2070 on behalf of Senator \nCollins.

Mr. President, this amendment requires the IRS to submit a \nreport on the debt indicator program which is currently used by the IRS \nto assist in tax filing and speeding up tax refunds where applicable. \nSenator Akaka has raised legitimate concerns on whether the debt \nindicator has led to the abuse of certain refund loans.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Natural Disaster Oil and \n     Gas Price Gouging Prevention Act of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. _02. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Commission.--The term ``Commission'' means the Federal \n     Trade Commission.\n       (2) Qualifying natural disaster declaration.--The term \n     ``qualifying natural disaster declaration'' means--\n       (A) a natural disaster declared by the Secretary under \n     section 321(a) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development \n     Act (7 U.S.C. 1961(a)); or\n       (B) a major disaster or emergency designated by the \n     President under the Robert T.

RESTRICTION ON PRICE GOUGING.\n\n       (a) Restrictions.--It shall be unlawful in the United \n     States during the period of a qualifying natural disaster \n     declaration in the United States to increase the price of any \n     oil or gas product more than 15 percent above the price of \n     that product immediately prior to the declaration unless the \n     increase in the amount charged is attributable to additional \n     costs incurred by the seller or national or international \n     market trends.\n       (b) Enforcement.--\n       (1) Enforcement powers.--\n       (A) In general.--The Commission shall enforce this section \n     as part of its duties under the Federal Trade Commission Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.).\n       (B) Reporting of violations.--For purposes of the \n     enforcement of this section, the Commission shall establish \n     procedures to permit the reporting of violations of this \n     section to the Commission, including appropriate links on the \n     Internet website of the Commission and the use of a toll-free \n     telephone number for such purposes.\n       (2) Penalty.--\n       (A) Criminal penalty.--A violation of this section shall be \n     deemed a felony and a person, upon conviction of a violation \n     of this section, shall be punished by fine not exceeding \n     $10,000,000 if a corporation, or, if any other person, \n     $350,000, or by imprisonment not exceeding 3 years, or both.\n       (B) Civil penalty.--The Commission may impose a civil \n     penalty not to exceed $5,000 for each violation of this \n     section. For purposes of this subparagraph, each day of \n     violation shall constitute a separate offense. Civil \n     penalties under this subparagraph shall not exceed amounts \n     provided in subparagraph (A).\n       (c) Action by State Attorney General.--The attorney general \n     of a State may bring a civil action for a violation of this \n     section pursuant to section 4C of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \n     15c).\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. This makes it a felony to raise oil or gas prices more \nthan 15 percent during a natural disaster and other emergencies, and \ngives the U.S. Trade Commission, U.S. Department of Justice, and State \nAttorneys General the authority to prosecute violators. This creates an \nexception for cases in which a price increase is directly attributable \nto additional costs incurred by the seller.\n  Currently, no Federal laws exist to address gasoline price gouging. \nOnly 13 States have such laws to prosecute those who raise prices \narbitrarily during times of emergency.\n  On September 1, in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, \nPresident Bush said in response to the price gouging that was underway:\n\n       There ought to be zero tolerance of people breaking the law \n     during an emergency such as this, whether it be looting or \n     price gouging at the gasoline pump, or taking advantage of \n     charitable giving or insurance fraud.\n\n  On September 6th of this year, I wrote a letter to the U.S. Attorney \nGeneral in which I said, in part:\n\n       I respectfully urge the Justice Department to follow \n     through on the President's warning and to investigate the \n     sudden spike in gas prices nationwide, following Hurricane \n     Katrina.\n\n  I further wrote:\n\n       I am deeply concerned that oil suppliers have used \n     Hurricane Katrina as an excuse to grossly overcharge \n     consumers, regardless of whether fuel is in short supply. The \n     Administration has a responsibility to protect consumers from \n     anyone who would exploit catastrophic circumstances for \n     outrageous profit,\n\n[[Page S11552]]\n\n     and I respectfully urge you to investigate this matter.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent my letter be printed at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. DAYTON. Almost 7 weeks later, I have not received even the \ncourtesy of a reply from the U.S. Attorney General. More importantly, I \nam not aware of anything that he has done to investigate collusion \namong the oil companies, the refiners, and the gasoline distributors \nwhose post-Hurricane Katrina price escalations parallel one another.\n  Gasoline prices nationwide are 36 percent higher than 1 year ago. \nNatural gas prices are 145 percent higher. That means that current \nnatural gas prices are almost 2\\1/2\\ times what they were a year ago.\n  The price of home heating oil in my home State of Minnesota now is 63 \npercent above a year ago. Americans everywhere are being ravaged \neconomically by energy companies, as the citizens in Louisiana and \nMississippi were ravaged by Katrina--although, obviously, their \nphysical and economic devastation was even worse.\n  While we have properly come to the aid of hurricane victims, Congress \nhas done nothing to help the victims of this energy price disaster. \nApparently, the Bush administration has failed them, also.\n  My amendment is an opportunity to do something to stop energy price \nexploitation, to make price gouging as illegal as it is immoral.\n  Actions speak louder than words. Now is the time to act against \nexorbitant energy prices, not just talk about them. The vote on my \namendment will show who is serious about driving energy costs down for \nall Americans, and who is not.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                September 6, 2005.\n     Hon. Alberto Gonzales,\n     Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Attorney General: On September 1st, President Bush \n     said, with respect to price gouging following Hurricane \n     Katrina, ``There ought to be zero tolerance of people \n     breaking the law during an emergency such as this, whether it \n     be looting, or price-gouging at the gasoline pump, or taking \n     advantage of charitable giving, or insurance fraud.''\n       I respectfully urge the Justice Department to follow \n     through on the President's warning and to investigate the \n     sudden spike in gas prices nationwide, following Hurricane \n     Katrina.\n       In my home state of Minnesota, gas prices rose by 52 \n     percent--from $1.97 to $3.01 per gallon--in the three-month \n     period from June 1st to September 1st. In three days alone, \n     from August 29th to September 1st, Minnesota gas prices \n     surged 45 cents per gallon. I understand that storm damage to \n     oil operations off the Gulf Coast has caused part of the \n     problem. However, most of Minnesota's oil supply originates \n     from Canada.\n       I am deeply concerned that oil suppliers have used \n     Hurricane Katrina as an excuse to grossly overcharge \n     consumers, regardless of whether fuel is in short supply. The \n     Administration has a responsibility to protect consumers from \n     anyone who would exploit catastrophic circumstances for \n     outrageous profit, and I respectfully urge you to investigate \n     this matter.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mark Dayton.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, not having had a chance to review the entire \nworkings of the amendment, this is a very serious legislative \namendment. Unfortunately, this is not the appropriate place to raise \nthis legislation. It is more appropriately concerned with the Energy \nCommittee or other committees. I, therefore, raise a point of order \nthat this is legislation on an appropriations bill. I believe now the \nChair has a copy of the amendment. I raise an objection under rule XVI \nthat this is legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the point is \nwell-taken. This is legislating on an appropriations bill and the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2141\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington, [Mrs. Murray], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2141.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness to \nconduct an assessment of guidance disseminated by agencies for grantees \n                    of homeless assistance programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following: Page 406, \n     line 8 insert a new paragraph.\n       Sec. 724. The United States Interagency Council on \n     Homelessness shall conduct an assessment of the guidance \n     disseminated by the Department of Education, the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development, and other related federal \n     agencies for grantees of homeless assistance programs on \n     whether such guidance is consistent with and does not \n     restrict the exercise of education rights provided to \n     parents, youth, and children under subtitle B of title VII of \n     the McKinney-Vento Act: Provided, That such assessment shall \n     address whether the practices, outreach, and training efforts \n     of said agencies serve to protect and advance such rights: \n     Provided further, That the Council shall submit to the House \n     and Senate Committees on Appropriations an interim report by \n     May 1, 2006, and a final report by September 1, 2006.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This amendment has been cleared on both sides. It simply \nrequires the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness to make sure that \nall of the appropriate agencies take into consideration the homeless \nassistance programs. This is especially important for kids today who \nare homeless, to make sure their rights are protected.\n  I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand this amendment is necessary \nbecause in some homeless shelters, children are being sent to schools \nwhere they have not been going. It has caused a great deal of \nconfusion. This is an appropriate measure and we accept it on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2141) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today for one very simple reason, \nthe days are relentlessly marching toward winter . . . the clock is \nticking as the thermometer edges ever downward . . . and it would be \nunconscionable for Congress to adjourn for the year without providing \ncritical, additional assistance for LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, at a time of skyrocketing fuel prices.\n  There should be no mistake, this is an emergency and a crisis we know \nis coming, and it would be an abrogation of our responsibility to stand \nby and allow it to occur. It does not take a crystal ball to predict \nthe dire consequences when home heating oil in Maine is $2.52 per \ngallon, up 59 cents from a year ago . . . kerosene prices average $2.95 \na gallon, 75 cents higher than this time last year, and it is not even \nwinter yet. Some projections have a gallon of heating oil reaching \n$3.00.\n  So understandably, we are already hearing the mounting concern ``how \nwill I pay for home heating oil when it's 30 percent more than last \nyear, and I struggled to make ends meet then?'' ``How will I afford to \npay half again as much for natural gas?'' People need to know now that \nthey can count on us for assistance.\n  This is a necessity of life--so much so that 73 percent of households \nin a recent survey reported they would cut back on, and even go \nwithout, other necessities such as food, prescription drugs, and \nmortgage and rent payments. Churches, food pantries, local service \norganizations--they are all hearing the cry, and all the leaves aren't \neven yet off of the trees. The fact is, countless American's don't have \nroom in their budget, many on fixed incomes, for this sudden surge in \nhome heating prices but surely, in looking at our national priorities, \nwe can find room in our budget to help Americans stay warm this winter.\n\n[[Page S11553]]\n\n  Because of the supply disruptions caused by the hurricanes at a time \nwhen prices were already spiraling up, prices have been driven even \nhigher and are directly affecting low income Mainers and how they will \nbe able to pay for their home heating oil, propane and kerosene this \nwinter. A recent Wall Street Journal quoted Jo-Ann Choate, who heads up \nMaine's LIHEAP program. Ms. Choate said, ``This year we've got a very \ngood chance of running out.'' Eighty-four percent of the applicants for \nthe LIHEAP program in the State use oil heat. Over 46,000 applied for \nand received State LIHEAP funds last winter. Each household received \n$480, which covered the cost of 275 gallons of heating oil.\n  The problem this winter is that the same $480 will buy only 172 \ngallons, which a household will use up in the first 3 to 4 weeks in \nMaine. What will these people do to stay warm for the four or five \nmonths left of winter? The water pipes will freeze and then break, \ndamaging homes. People will start using their stoves to get heat. The \nMortgage Bankers Association expects that the steep energy costs could \nincrease the number of missed payments and lost homes beginning later \nthis year. My State is expecting at least 48,000 applicants this \nwinter, so there will be less money distributed to each household \nunless we can obtain higher funding for the LIHEAP program.\n  Ms. Choate says that Maine plans to focus on the elderly, disabled, \nand families with small children, and is studying how to move others to \nheated shelters. This is why our efforts are so very important. And it \nisn't just Maine, it is happening in all of the Nation's cold weather \nStates. Quite simply, without increased funding, we are forcing the \nmanagers of State LIHEAP programs to make a Solomon's choice. I request \nthat the Wall Street Journal article of October 6, 2005 be printed for \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 6, 2005]\n\n  Fearing Shortfall Linked to Hurricanes, States Scramble to Stretch \n                      Federal Aid Among the Needy\n\n                          (By John J. Fialka)\n\n       Washington.--State managers of the $2 billion federal \n     program that helps poor people pay their heating bills say \n     that price increases following hurricanes Katrina and Rita \n     could mean some homes will run out of fuel this winter.\n       The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program has helped \n     consumers pay about half of the average $600 home heating \n     bill in recent years. But this winter will be different. The \n     Department of Energy estimates that the cost of heating an \n     average home with oil will rise to $1,666 and to $1,568 for \n     natural gas, but the federal money budgeted for the program \n     remains the same.\n       ``We're looking at a situation we've never really faced \n     before,'' says Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National \n     Energy Assistance Directors' Association, state agencies that \n     funnel the federal money to people who meet state criteria \n     for fuel help.\n       The problem will be most acute in Northern states, where \n     running out of fuel poses health risks, particularly to the \n     elderly, and could damage homes if water pipes freeze and \n     then break. ``This year we've got a very good chance of \n     running out,'' says Jo-Ann Choate, who manages the program \n     for Maine's Housing Authority.\n       Her state's program has already received a host of new \n     applications, but its buying power has shrunk. Last year, the \n     program paid $480 for each household it assisted, covering \n     the cost of 275 gallons of heating oil. This year, $480 will \n     buy only 172 gallons. She figures that in a normal winter, \n     ``That will go in the first three or four weeks.''\n       If there is a funding shortfall, Maine plans to focus the \n     money it has on the elderly, disabled and families with small \n     children. It is studying how to move others to heated \n     shelters. ``We'll need to get people who know how to drain \n     the pipes if people are moved out of their homes,'' Ms. \n     Choate says. ``They'll have to be volunteers, though, because \n     we'll have no money to pay them.''\n       In Wisconsin, Susan Brown, director of the state's energy-\n     assistance program, says the program ``will pay less of a \n     given heating bill.'' The number of clients--70% of whom use \n     natural gas--has traditionally grown by 2% a year. This year, \n     she worries that number could increase by as much as 30%. \n     ``If that's the case,'' she warns, ``we will simply have to \n     shut the program down.''\n       According to the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     which provides the money to states, heating-bill increases \n     are felt more acutely by the poor. In 2002, for example, the \n     average household spent 5.9% of its income on heating \n     compared with 12.6% spent by low-income households.\n       Additional help may be on the way as Congress and the Bush \n     administration weigh proposals to increase funding. Senate \n     Democrats led by Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts are trying \n     to add $3.1 billion to the program by attaching the money to \n     a Defense Department spending bill.\n       ``It is unthinkable that this administration would fail to \n     have the emergency funds available to help families who need \n     it the most,'' Sen. Kerry said in a statement, suggesting \n     that Democrats will have a powerful issue for next year's \n     elections if there is a shortfall of heating funds this \n     winter.\n       A spokesman for the HHS, which added some emergency funds \n     to the program during last year's heating season, said an \n     increase in funding this year would be for Congress to \n     decide. Paul Scofield, a spokesman for the House \n     Appropriations Committee, said that ``we've always tried to \n     keep this program funded,'' but added that, so far, it hasn't \n     received any proposal to add money from the Bush \n     administration.\n       ``We've had a very mild winter in the last five or six \n     years. If we get a real Montana winter this year, that's \n     what's really got us spooked,'' says Jim Nolan, the heating \n     program's director in Montana. Last year his program served \n     21,000 households, but about 85,000 are potentially eligible \n     this year. With rising energy costs, he says, ``we could \n     reach a tipping point and drive the number of applicants much \n     higher.''\n       His department is lobbying for more assistance money from \n     state electricity and gas utilities, which have a ``public \n     purpose fund'' that earmarks 25 percent for energy assistance \n     for the poor. This year, Mr. Nolan wants 70 percent of the \n     money, which would take funding away from renewable-energy \n     projects, such as solar and wind power.\n       Mr. Wolfe, who represents the state directors in \n     Washington, says that without substantially more help from \n     the federal government, the states and utilities will have to \n     use a ``triage'' system to get families through the winter. \n     In some states that will mean shifting more money to homes \n     that use heating oil because oil distributors customarily \n     won't deliver unless they are paid in advance, Mr. Wolfe \n     says.\n       That means less money for utilities that supply natural \n     gas. Those companies, on the other hand, are reluctant to cut \n     off homes in the dead of winter. ``They'll get paid later,'' \n     says Mr. Wolfe, who said legislatures in several states \n     including Massachusetts, New York and some in the Midwest are \n     pondering ways to supplement the federal funding.\n       The effects of a federal program stretched thin will be \n     uneven, since some utilities have a much higher percentage of \n     low-income customers than others. About three-fourths of the \n     nation's home heating-oil customers are in New England.\n       In Montana, a state law forbids natural-gas companies from \n     shutting off fuel to customers in the winter. But users of \n     propane, a gas commonly used in rural areas, aren't \n     protected.\n       Chemical companies and manufacturers that produce products \n     using natural gas often have ``interruptible contracts,'' \n     which means that if supplies run short, utilities will cut \n     them off and send the gas to homeowners.\n       If there are frequent interruptions this winter, ``it's \n     going to wash its way through the entire economy,'' predicts \n     Charles Van Vlack, vice president of the American Chemistry \n     Council, which represents 130 companies. ``Just saying \n     industrial users are going to drop off of the [supply] system \n     is a poor outcome. It's going to knock out jobs.''\n\n  The Federal Department of Energy has predicted that homeowners who \nuse oil for heat and propane will spend 30 percent more this year than \nlast, and natural gas users will spend 48 percent more. According to \nthe National Energy Assistance Directors Association, heating costs for \nthe average family using heating oil are projected to hit $1,666 for \nthe upcoming winter. This represents an increase of $403 over last \nwinter's prices and $714 over the winter heating season of 2003-2004.\n  For families using natural gas, prices are projected to hit $1,568, \nwhich is an increase of $611 over last year's price and $643 over 2003-\n2004. This is the largest increase in home heating prices in over 30 \nyears. This is why our amendment is so very important.\n  Congress recently passed an Energy bill which is now law. In that \nbill, we authorized $5.1 billion for the LIHEAP program. My goal is to \nsee that this is totally funded. We simply have to show that we meant \nwhat we asked for and totally fund the LIHEAP program. A total of $5.1 \nbillion has already been authorized. All we are asking with this \nmeasure is to provide an additional $3.1 billion in emergency LIHEAP \nfunding in additional to the $2 billion already requested by the \nPresident. Passage of this amendment to the Transportation/Treasury/\nHousing Appropriations bill is vital.\n  The facts are that LIHEAP is projected to help 5 million households \nnationwide this winter. But that's only about one-sixth of households \nacross the country that qualify for the assistance. So this is a \nperennial fight we wage even when prices aren't as high as today. And \nnow, that battle becomes all the more pivotal.\n\n[[Page S11554]]\n\n  I want to thank Senators Reed and Collins for their leadership on \nthis amendment and I am proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with them \nto secure what is, in essence, literally life-or-death funding for our \nmost vulnerable Americans. The cold weather won't wait and neither \nshould we when it comes to helping citizens survive through the winter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with temperatures dropping, there are few \nmore important duties than keeping our citizens safe and warm for the \nwinter. Rising fuel prices give added urgency to our efforts to lend a \nhand to those who can't afford their heating bills.\n  Sadly, the gap between rich and poor has been widening in our \nsociety, especially in recent years. The number of persons living in \npoverty in the Nation has risen from 31 million in 2000 to 37 million \ntoday, a 19 percent increase during the Bush administration. Thirteen \nmillion children now live in poverty. Wages remain stagnant, while \ninflation inexorably sinks more and more families below the poverty \nline. The long-term unemployment rate is at historic highs. There is no \nexcuse for America to continue to look the other way. Hurricane Katrina \ndemonstrated the plight of minorities for all of us to see, for all the \nworld to see. The ``silent slavery of poverty'' is not so silent any \nmore.\n  For those in poverty, the American dream is a nightmare. Families \nstay awake at night worrying how to make ends meet. Parents wonder how \nthey will feed their children and pay their bills.\n  Rising energy costs are a huge part of the problem. Significant \nnumbers of citizens live with the constant threat of power shut-offs, \nbecause they can't pay their energy bills, and there's no relief in \nsight.\n  According to a recent report by the Energy Information \nAdministration, the outlook for the coming winter is bleak. Home \nheating bills are likely to soar. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have \nstrained already-tight oil and natural gas production. According to the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute, 20 percent of the Nation's refinery \ncapacity is down or is restarting as a result of damage by both \nhurricanes.\n  On average, households heating primarily with natural gas will pay \n$350 more this winter for heat, an increase of an incredible 48 percent \nover last year. Those relying primarily on oil will pay $378 more, an \nincrease of 32 percent.\n  These are not just abstract numbers. They represent huge burdens on \nreal people. Just last week, Mayor Menino and I met with low-income \nseniors at the Curtis Hall Community Center in Massachusetts. They are \nscared that they won't be able to make ends meet this winter. They are \nworried about how they'll pay their high home heating bills. \nPredictions of a cold winter and sky-high fuel costs mean that the \nelderly, the disabled, and many others will be forced to make \nimpossible choices between heating their homes and paying for food, or \nhealth care, or rent.\n  A Federal program is supposed to be available to help the poorest of \nthe poor to avoid these unacceptable tradeoffs. LIHEAP, the Low Income \nHome Energy Assistance Program, grants aid to low-income families who \ncan't afford the steep cost of energy.\n  The number of households receiving this assistance has increased from \n4 million in 2002 to 5 million this year, the highest level in ten \nyears.\n  Ninety-four percent of LIHEAP households have at least one family \nmember who is elderly, disabled, a child under the age of 18, or a \nsingle parent with a young child. 77 percent of LIHEAP recipients \nreport an annual income at or below $20,000 and 61 percent of \nrecipients have annual incomes at or below the poverty line.\n  Shameful, however, LIHEAP is not being given the funds needed to meet \ntoday's responsibilities. In fact, the President's budget funds the \nprogram at $2 billion which is almost the same today as when the \nprogram was created in 1981, the first year of the administration of \nPresident Ronald Reagan. Since then, heating oil prices have gone up \n265 percent.\n  Meanwhile, demand for LIHEAP funding has increased. In Massachusetts, \nit serves 130,000 households, including 15,000 in Boston.\n  Eight thousand of the 12,000 fuel assistance applications sent out \nfor this winter have already been returned, 1,500 more than this time \nlast year.\n  With current funding, even those receiving LIHEAP assistance won't \nreceive enough to last the entire winter.\n  In Massachusetts, one 71-year-old woman lives alone and keeps her \nthermostat set at 60 degrees to save money. She hopes the Federal \nGovernment will come through with more LIHEAP money before she runs out \nof ways to pay her heating bill. She says, ``I turn down the thermostat \nas low as I can and sometimes I turn it off and put on extra sweaters. \nI don't know how much longer I can keep doing this.''\n  Many families will struggle just to get their heat turned back on for \nthe winter because they still owe money from last winter's bills.\n  Another example is a single mother who lives with her baby daughter. \nShe's a nurse, but she lost her job in August 2004 has been relying on \ntemporary jobs since then.\n  Her pay doesn't cover her bills, and her electricity has been cut \noff. She worries about how she can pay off her bills this winter.\n  It is wrong for us to let people like this suffer. So how does the \nRepublican leadership in Congress respond? By cutting funds for \nessential low income programs.\n  In spite of Katrina, the administration and the House of \nRepresentatives continue to close their eyes to the long-term needs of \nthe poor. Emergency aid was impossible for even the most hard-hearted \nMembers of Congress to refuse. But as the spotlight fades it is back to \npoverty as usual. The House sent the Senate a continuing resolution \nwhich freezes funding for the LIHEAP program. But that funding \nobviously isn't enough. Nineteen percent of current LIHEAP recipients \nsay they keep their home at a temperature they feel is unsafe or \nunhealthy. Eight percent report that their electricity or gas was shut \noff in the past year for nonpayment.\n  The continuing resolution also cut the Community Services Block Grant \nby 50 percent. These funds are used by many community action agencies \nto administer the LIHEAP assistance.\n  According to ABCD, a community action agency in Massachusetts whose \nneighborhood network handles the outreach and application process for \nLIHEAP, the cut in funding means that access to this critical survival \nresource will shrink by more than 70 percent. Up to 10,500 households, \nout of a current total of 15,000 recipients, may not get their \nbenefits.\n  Those of us in Congress who care about this issue sent an urgent \nrequest to the President to increase the funds, but our request has \ngone unanswered.\n  We are here today to say that LIHEAP may not be on the \nadministration's agenda, but it is on our agenda. That is why we are \nfighting so hard to increase LIHEAP funding. Senator Kerry and I \noffered an amendment on the DOD Appropriations bill to increase LIHEAP \nfunding by $3.1 billion.\n  Almost every Democratic Senator voted for it, but the Republican \nSenators overwhelmingly opposed it and it was defeated. We will \ncontinue to raise this issue again and again and again, until our \nNation's neediest families are fully protected this winter.\n  So I strongly support Senator Reed's and Senator Collins' amendment \nto this appropriations bill, and I hope the Republican leadership will \nallow us to have an up or down vote on this amendment at some point \nduring this debate.\n  Congress needs to stand up for the millions of Americans struggling \nto make ends meet. We need to tell low-income families across the \ncountry that we heard them, we care about them, and we don't intend to \nleave them shivering in the cold this winter.\n  LIHEAP is indispensable in filling that need. It is wrong for \nCongress to shortchange LIHEAP and the millions of families who need \nour help the most. Until every parent has a warm place to come home to \nevery day, and every child has a warm bed to sleep in every night, our \njob is not done.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the amendment to \nenhance the Free File Alliance. The Free File Alliance is a partnership \nbetween the Internal Revenue Service and the private technology \nindustry.\n  This voluntary program was created in 2002 after the IRS tried to \ncreate its\n\n[[Page S11555]]\n\nown tax preparation software and e-filing program at the taxpayers' \nexpense. Such a program would have needlessly duplicated the resources \nand investments of the private sector. Instead, the Free File Alliance \ncame into being, helping preserve voluntary compliance.\n  This Alliance provides free electronic tax preparation and e-filing \nservices to lower income, disadvantaged and underserved taxpayers. In \nits first 3 years of existence, the Free File Alliance has donated some \n10 million tax returns to American taxpayers and has helped \nsignificantly increase the number of e-filed tax returns. The success \nof this unique public-private partnership has been achieved at no cost \nto the taxpayers.\n  This alliance has benefited the American public. It has allowed the \nIRS to focus its resources and efforts on its congressionally \nauthorized mission and objectives. The budget simply does not have room \nfor waste or duplication, and the Free File public-private partnership \nhas met an urgent need in the most cost-effective way possible.\n  There are long-standing program management issues that need to be \ncorrected in the IRS oversight of the Free File program. For the first \n3 years, the Service failed to make necessary management reforms. \nCongress has provided specific direction in terms of taxpayer \nprotections, but the needed reforms have still not been put in place.\n  This amendment is fully consistent with all of the previous \nCongressional direction. It provides that the IRS and the Department of \nTreasury do not waiver from this direction. It will also ensure that \nthe IRS does not provide all aspects of tax functions, including tax \npreparation services. That kind of conflict of interest cannot ever be \npermitted. The American people expect us to look out for their \ninterests in such matters, to ensure fairness and balance in the \nsystem, and to protect their rights to voluntary compliance.\n  This amendment and accompanying report language should get the Free \nFile program on track to achieve its intended purposes and objectives, \nand ensure that the IRS keeps its energies and resources focused on \ncritical core missions, rather than spending precious public funds to \ntry to expand them.\n  This is a basic good government, taxpayer-focused measure, and I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n\n\n                            Notice of Intent\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, in accordance with rule V of the standing \nrules of the Senate, I hereby give notice in writing of my intention to \nmove to suspend Paragraph 4 of Rule XVI for the purpose of proposing to \nthe Bill, H.R. 3058, the Transportation, Treasury, and Housing and \nUrban Development Appropriations Bill, the following amendment: No. \n2143.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11555-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, as we pause to observe Breast Cancer \nAwareness Month, I would like to focus on the need to study the causes \nof this frightening disease, including the possible link between breast \ncancer and the environment.\n  Women diagnosed with breast cancer inevitably all ask the same \nquestion: Why me?\n  The unfortunate truth in all too many instances is, we don't know. \nLess than 30 percent of breast cancers are explained by known risk \nfactors.\n  We don't know if the environment plays a role in the development of \nbreast cancer. Studies have explored the effect of isolated \nenvironmental factors such as diet, pesticides, and even \nelectromagnetic fields. In most cases, the results have been \ninconclusive. Furthermore, there are many other factors that are \nsuspected to play a role that have yet to be studied.\n  We must find answers. While there is much we don't know, it is clear \nthat a better understanding of the role the environment plays in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer could help to improve our understanding of \nthe causes of breast cancer and could lead to prevention strategies.\n  For several years now, I have worked to pass bipartisan legislation, \nThe Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act, which would give \nscientists the tools they need to better understand any link between \nbreast cancer and the environment. The Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Act would dedicate $30 million a year for 5 years for the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, to award \ngrants to study the relationship between environmental factors and \nbreast cancer. Under a competitive, peer-reviewed grant-making process \nthat involves patient advocates, the NIEHS Director would award grants \nfor the development and operation of up to eight centers for the \npurpose of conducting multi-disciplinary research.\n  To date, there has been only a limited research investment to study \nthe role of the environment in the development of breast cancer--but we \nare making progress. Over the past several years, I have worked with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee to include \nappropriations language that has allowed the NIEHS to award grants to \nfour research centers to begin to study the prenatal-to-adult \nenvironmental exposures that may predispose a woman to breast cancer.\n  This is a promising step in the right direction, but it is only a \ndown payment on the task at hand. Moreover, the research strategy for \nthese grants does not follow the nationally focused, collaborative, and \ncomprehensive model as outlined in the Breast Cancer and Environmental \nResearch Act.\n  More research must be done to determine the impact of the environment \non breast cancer. If we miss promising research opportunities because \nCongress has failed to act, millions of women and their families will \nface difficult questions about breast cancer . . . and we won't have \nthe answers.\n  These women and their families deserve answers. That's why we must \nwork together to pass this bill, which enjoys broad bipartisan support. \nI urge my colleagues to observe Breast Cancer Awareness Month and to \nsupport the quest for answers about this deadly disease by supporting \nthe Breast Cancer and Environmental Research Act.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today in observance of National \nBreast Cancer Awareness Month. Today, 3 million American women are \nliving with this disease. In 2005, an additional 200,000 women are \nexpected to be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and over 40,000 \nwill die from this disease. While in recent years we have seen \nsignificant advances in breast cancer research, scientists are still \nresearching many questions that remain unanswered regarding the causes \nand prevention of this disease.\n  I am particularly concerned about the likely impact that \nenvironmental factors have in contributing to the prevalence of breast \ncancer. That is why I support the bipartisan Breast Cancer \nEnvironmental Research Act, S. 757, which would provide $30 million a \nyear for 5 years for the development and operation of multi-\ninstitutional, multi-disciplinary research centers to study \nenvironmental factors potentially linked to breast cancer. There is a \nclear need for research. We owe it to breast cancer survivors and \nvictims to pass this legislation.\n  Over the past several years, New Jersey has consistently ranked in \nthe top 10 states in the Nation for breast cancer incidence and \nmortality. That is why I feel especially strongly about supporting \nfurther progress and future advancements in the fight against this \nawful disease that will only continue to cause suffering among American \nwomen if we fail to act.\n  In addition to passing S. 757, we must also increase funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, the National Cancer Institute, NCI, \nand the Centers for Disease Control, CDC, all of which have played a \nmajor role in the development of improved treatment. Despite the \ncritical role these agencies play in developing tools to fight and \nprevent cancer, the President and Republican-led Congress have \nsignificantly underfunded breast cancer initiatives at NIH, NCI, and \nCDC. We need to do more.\n\n[[Page S11556]]\n\n  We need a collaborative, comprehensive, national strategy to study \nthe etiology of breast cancer. The Breast Cancer Environmental Research \nAct would accomplish this. I urge all of my colleagues to observe \nNational Breast Cancer Awareness month by supporting this critical \npiece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11556-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for \nhate crimes legislation. Each Congress, Senator Kennedy and I introduce \nhate crimes legislation that would add new categories to current hate \ncrimes law, sending a signal that violence of any kind is unacceptable \nin our society. Likewise, each Congress I have come to the floor to \nhighlight a separate hate crime that has occurred in our country.\n  John Solis was attacked and beaten after a gay-pride event in \nBrooklyn, NY on June 29, 2004. A dozen people shouted anti-gay slurs at \nSolis. When he turned to confront them they attacked him with baseball \nbats. Solis's wrist was broken and he was hit in the head. The police \nwere slow to respond and ineffective.\n  I believe that the government's first duty is to defend its citizens, \nto defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I \nbelieve that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we \ncan change hearts and minds as well.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, as Breast Cancer Awareness \nMonth comes to a close, to urge my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring S. 757, the Breast Cancer Environmental Research Act.\n  It has long been believed that the environment plays some role in the \ndevelopment of breast cancer, but the extent of that role is not \nunderstood. Today, less than 30 percent of breast cancers are explained \nby known risk factors. There are studies exploring the effect of things \nlike diet, pesticides, and electromagnetic fields on breast cancer \nincidence, but in most cases, these and many other environmental \nfactors that are also suspected to play a role have not been fully \ninvestigated. We need a collaborative, comprehensive, national strategy \nto explore these issues.\n  The Breast Cancer Environmental Research Act would create a uniquely \ntargeted research plan, similar in design to the incredibly efficient \nDepartment of Defense Peer Reviewed Breast Cancer Research Program. \nThis bill would authorize $30 million a year for 5 years for the \nNational Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS, to award \ngrants to study the relationship between environmental factors and \nbreast cancer. Under a competitive, peer-reviewed grantmaking process \nthat involves patient advocates, the NIEHS Director would award grants \nfor the development and operation of up to eight centers for the \npurpose of conducting multidisciplinary research. It would require \ncollaboration with community organizations in the area, including those \nthat represent women with breast cancer, as an integral component of \nthe centers. Inherent in its structure would be the kind of efficiency, \nand public accountability that has made an overwhelming number of my \ncolleagues, as well as scientists and consumers, so supportive of the \nDepartment of Defense Breast Cancer Research Program.\n  In honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, I urge my colleagues to \njoin me and continue to fight the war on breast cancer, and invest in \ngetting the answers to eradicating this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11556-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11556-S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB SPARBOE\n\n Mr. COLEMAN. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to a \nMinnesota hero and an American hero, Robert Sparboe, who passed away \nlast week. If anyone around the world wanted to know why this is the \ngreatest country in the world, I would tell them: Take a look at the \nlife of Bob Sparboe. He is proof positive that the surest path to \nsuccess is working hard in a free society.\n  Bob Sparboe found his success in the egg business. He went from a \n$5,000 investment after the Korean war to a $260 million operation \nemploying 600 people in four States. If anyone in the sound of my voice \nhas ever eaten an egg in a Midwestern restaurant, you are one of his \ncustomers. He has presided over 10 million hens laying over 2 billion \neggs a year.\n  I often wonder from where Americans are getting their values. I sure \nhope it is not from overhyped rock stars, movie stars, and media \ncreations. One of the values of our State of Minnesota is people are \nusually only one generation or one set of relations removed from the \nfarm. We learn what farmers know; there are four seasons to life: \nplanting, growing, harvesting, and resting. Not much of value is \nproduced by people who cram. There are seasons and rhythms to life that \nmust be understood and respected.\n  Bob was a wealth of wisdom. Here are a few of his gems collected from \nan article written honoring him last year:\n\n       The smartest thing you can do is hire someone who is more \n     capable than you are.\n\n       It's better to have an average plan with superior execution \n     than a superior plan with average execution.\n\n       A good leader creates leaders out of his followers. And a \n     really good leader creates moral agents.\n\n       Leadership is about coping with change. Management is about \n     coping with complexity.\n\n       You need to adopt the attitude that ``I will succeed, not \n     only in spite of my limitations, but because of them.''\n\n  We get pretty full of ourselves in this city, imagining that we are \nrunning the world. But all the success our Nation achieves comes from \nthe hard work, risk taking, and character of regular folks like Bob \nSparboe, who achieve beyond their wildest dreams. His life was the \nAmerican dream incarnate. We offer our condolences to his family and \nfriends. And we are grateful to have had the privilege to know a person \nof such great character, drive and wisdom.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the following statement from former United \nStates Senator Rudolph E. Boschwitz be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n       Picture a young Bob Sparboe, just back from the Army, his \n     head full of dreams, eager to start his own business eager to \n     make his first deal, and there he was young Bob sitting \n     across the desk from the banker in Litchfield, Minnesota. \n     Bankers always appear in this kind of story as a scowling, \n     unfriendly, bunch of fellows. Bob never commented about that, \n     but he needed $1,400 for just 21 days. Scowl or not, the \n     banker must have had some doubts. The normal borrower didn't \n     come in for a 21-day loan.\n       Bob eventually solved the problem by buying the bank--\n     something he never would have believed that day many years \n     ago. He got the loan. He made the deal. And he paid the \n     banker back on time.\n       His head was full of dreams. And one of the endearing and \n     enduring elements of Bob's life was that he never stopped \n     dreaming. Ambition didn't fade as he aged. And he lived his \n     ever-enlarging dreams to their fullest. Not only with regard \n     to his business, but with his wonderful family as well.\n       Not everybody knew Bob and I would occasionally introduce \n     him as a man who had six million chickens laying eggs and \n     doing so with regularity. Not too long ago, Bob corrected me \n     to say with quiet pride, ``It is now twelve million, Rudy.''\n       Bob and I both admired Ronald Reagan and Reagan would often \n     say, ``If you give people enough freedom and opportunity, \n     ordinary people will achieve extraordinary things.''\n       Bob was such a person Bob proved Reagan right. Bob \n     recognized what the promise of America had given him and it \n     filled his heart with a deep and abiding love for this great \n     country. It was in that way--through the political process--\n     that I met Bob and Deanna and other members of their family \n     and the Sparboe Farms family as well.\n       Some may believe that our country's greatness was achieved \n     by politicians sitting in Washington or St. Paul and indeed \n     it is their names that fill the history books. But they were \n     not the builders. Their actions preserved and enhanced the \n     opportunities and freedoms, but the builders of democracy are \n     and were the Bob Sparboes of our country.\n       People who had dreams. People who were willing to take \n     risks--even for 21 days--and then never stopped dreaming and \n     working full time to achieve those ever-enlarging dreams.\n       So Bob will be missed not only by a very loving family, but \n     America will miss Bob as well.\n       We have lost not only a friend, a father, a husband and \n     grandfather, but America has lost one of the finest builders \n     of its greatness. One of its proudest sons.\n       Bob Sparboe--an extraordinary life, an extraordinary \n     example of the wonders of democracy.\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11556-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11556-S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BOB SPARBOE\n\n Mr. COLEMAN.

And a \n     really good leader creates moral agents.\n\n       Leadership is about coping with change. Management is about \n     coping with complexity.\n\n       You need to adopt the attitude that ``I will succeed, not \n     only in spite of my limitations, but because of them.''\n\n  We get pretty full of ourselves in this city, imagining that we are \nrunning the world. But all the success our Nation achieves comes from \nthe hard work, risk taking, and character of regular folks like Bob \nSparboe, who achieve beyond their wildest dreams. His life was the \nAmerican dream incarnate. We offer our condolences to his family and \nfriends. And we are grateful to have had the privilege to know a person \nof such great character, drive and wisdom.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the following statement from former United \nStates Senator Rudolph E. Boschwitz be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n       Picture a young Bob Sparboe, just back from the Army, his \n     head full of dreams, eager to start his own business eager to \n     make his first deal, and there he was young Bob sitting \n     across the desk from the banker in Litchfield, Minnesota. \n     Bankers always appear in this kind of story as a scowling, \n     unfriendly, bunch of fellows. Bob never commented about that, \n     but he needed $1,400 for just 21 days. Scowl or not, the \n     banker must have had some doubts. The normal borrower didn't \n     come in for a 21-day loan.\n       Bob eventually solved the problem by buying the bank--\n     something he never would have believed that day many years \n     ago. He got the loan. He made the deal. And he paid the \n     banker back on time.\n       His head was full of dreams. And one of the endearing and \n     enduring elements of Bob's life was that he never stopped \n     dreaming. Ambition didn't fade as he aged. And he lived his \n     ever-enlarging dreams to their fullest. Not only with regard \n     to his business, but with his wonderful family as well.\n       Not everybody knew Bob and I would occasionally introduce \n     him as a man who had six million chickens laying eggs and \n     doing so with regularity. Not too long ago, Bob corrected me \n     to say with quiet pride, ``It is now twelve million, Rudy.''\n       Bob and I both admired Ronald Reagan and Reagan would often \n     say, ``If you give people enough freedom and opportunity, \n     ordinary people will achieve extraordinary things.''\n       Bob was such a person Bob proved Reagan right. Bob \n     recognized what the promise of America had given him and it \n     filled his heart with a deep and abiding love for this great \n     country. It was in that way--through the political process--\n     that I met Bob and Deanna and other members of their family \n     and the Sparboe Farms family as well.\n       Some may believe that our country's greatness was achieved \n     by politicians sitting in Washington or St. Paul and indeed \n     it is their names that fill the history books. But they were \n     not the builders. Their actions preserved and enhanced the \n     opportunities and freedoms, but the builders of democracy are \n     and were the Bob Sparboes of our country.\n       People who had dreams. People who were willing to take \n     risks--even for 21 days--and then never stopped dreaming and \n     working full time to achieve those ever-enlarging dreams.\n       So Bob will be missed not only by a very loving family, but \n     America will miss Bob as well.\n       We have lost not only a friend, a father, a husband and \n     grandfather, but America has lost one of the finest builders \n     of its greatness. One of its proudest sons.\n       Bob Sparboe--an extraordinary life, an extraordinary \n     example of the wonders of democracy.\n\n[[Page S11557]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11557-1", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11557-2", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11557-3", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DECLARED \n    IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 12978 WITH RESPECT TO SIGNIFICANT NARCOTICS \n                TRAFFICKERS CENTERED IN COLOMBIA--PM 27\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1622(d), \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice to the Federal Register for publication, stating that \nthe emergency declared with respect to significant narcotics \ntraffickers centered in Colombia is to continue in effect beyond \nOctober 21, 2005. The most recent notice continuing this emergency was \npublished in the Federal Register on October 20, 2004 (69 Fed. Reg. \n61733).\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on October 21, 1995, of \na national emergency have not been resolved. The actions of significant \nnarcotics traffickers centered in Colombia continue to pose an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and \neconomy of the United States and to cause unparalleled violence, \ncorruption, and harm in the United States and abroad. For these \nreasons, I have determined that it is necessary to maintain economic \npressure on significant narcotics traffickers centered in Colombia by \nblocking their property and interests in property that are in the \nUnited States or within the possession or control of United States \npersons and by depriving them of access to the U.S. market and \nfinancial system.\n                                                      George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1887. A bill to authorize the conduct of small projects for the \nrehabilitation or removal of dams; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I joined Senator Kennedy, \nRepresentative Frank, Governor Romney and Mayor Robert Nunes on a tour \nof the deteriorating dam in Taunton, MA. The dam buckled earlier this \nweek under the pressure of heavy rain. Since the beginning of this \nmonth, Taunton has received 11\\1/2\\ inches of rain, with more than 7 \ninches of that from Friday through Sunday.\n  As of this morning, the city remained under a state of emergency and \nthere was still a significant amount of water behind the Whittenton \nPond Dam on the Mill River. In speaking with local officials, they \nexpressed fear that a major break in the dam could send 6 feet of water \nsurging through downtown Taunton, flooding businesses and destroying \nhomes.\n  For now, the situation is under control but still extremely volatile. \nIt appears we may have gotten lucky--but just because the waters are \nreceding doesn't mean our work is through. Doing everything possible \nmeans the Federal Government has to give mayors and governors every \ntool they need to protect their communities.\n  Today, the Army Corps of Engineers can help in Taunton only because \nit's an emergency--and everyone who has been praying that the dam \ndoesn't break knows just what an emergency this has been. But according \nto the law, it's only at that point of no return that the Corps can \nstep in. The Army Corps of Engineers has no authority to try to prevent \na situation like this. Before the water came pouring through and 2,000 \npeople were evacuated from their homes, the Corps was powerless to fix \nthis dam.\n  But it's not just on the Mill River--we have 3,000 privately-owned \ndams in Massachusetts. The Army Corps of Engineers shouldn't be \nhandcuffed by bureaucratic red tape until we reach the point of a make-\nit-or-break-it crisis. If Hurricane Katrina taught us anything, it's \nthat we can't let bureaucracy get in the way of preventing a pending \ndisaster or responding to a looming threat.\n  For that reason, I am introducing a bill to give the Army Corps of \nEngineers the ability to intervene to repair privately-owned dams for \nthe sake of public safety. That way, the Corps can help in the kind of \neffort Governor Romney is now undertaking to inspect and strengthen \ndams across the State. Senator Kennedy is co-sponsoring this bill, and \nwe will work together to make it law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1888. A bill to provide for 2 programs to authorize the use of \nleave by caregivers for family members of certain individuals \nperforming military service, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nMilitary Family Support Act of 2005 with my colleague and friend from \nWisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold. Our bill will help military families \nease the stress caused by long-term absences due to deployments \noverseas.\n  I was contacted a few months back by a group of Vermonters looking \nfor a way to help their coworkers with family in the Vermont National \nGuard. When a member of the armed forces is activated and deployed, \nfamily structures and daily functioning are severely affected. The day-\nto-day life of families is, in many cases, more than a one-person job. \nAny absence, especially absences of several months due to a deployment \noverseas, can be debilitating to family life. The stories of soldiers \nand their families from Enosburg Falls, VT, were told very poignantly \nin a piece reported by the Los Angeles Times. Enosburg and neighboring \ncommunities have contributed a disproportionately high number of \nNational Guard troops to Operation Iraqi Freedom. Because of this, \nEnosburg's men and women have felt the pains of separation and long \ndeployments more than most. Enosburg and surrounding towns and villages \nshould be proud of the sacrifices made by their men and women in \nuniform and by those employers and family members who remained at home. \nVermont is a place where neighbors help neighbors and I am proud of all \nthe people throughout the state who have given so much support to Guard \nfamilies.\n  The Military Family Support Act of 2005 is a straightforward bill \nthat proposes two pilot programs. The first pilot program, administered \nby the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, would authorize Federal \nemployees, who have been designated by a member of the Armed Forces as \n``caregivers'', as defined by the Department of Defense, DOD, to use \ntheir leave in a more flexible manner. No new leave would be conferred \nto any employees. This bill simply makes leave already available more \nuseful during stressful times for military families. The second pilot \nprogram would be established by the Department of Labor, DOL, to \nsolicit businesses to voluntarily take part in a program to offer more \naccommodating leave to their employees. This bill does not include in \nits scope the Family Medical Leave Act, FMLA, and it does not require \nany private sector entity to participate. The goal of the Military \nFamily Support Act is to make life a little easier for those who are \nalready giving so much to our country and to their communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a May 2, 2005, article from the Los \nAngeles Times be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the Military Family Support Act of 2005 be printed in \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the materials were printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n[[Page S11562]]\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 2, 2005]\n\n                         A Town Called to Duty\n\n                         (By Elizabeth Mehren)\n\n\nfor a rural Vermont community, the conflict in Iraq hits home. With its \n    guardsmen deployed, locals band together to cover their absence\n\n       For four years, Matt Tracy spent his days pumping gas and \n     repairing car engines at Mark LaRose's Texaco on Main Street. \n     At night, the 33-year-old father of two studied law. He \n     fended off frequent entreaties from military recruiters and \n     held fast to his dream of becoming a litigator.\n       Then in December, LaRose was called up for active duty, \n     along with the entire National Guard unit in this remote, \n     rural town of 1,473. The deployment of 88 men in Company B, \n     1st Battalion, 172nd Armor Regiment, 42nd Infantry Division--\n     better known as Bravo Company--has touched just about \n     everyone in the area.\n       For Tracy, it meant his plans to exchange his wrench for an \n     attache case went on hold.\n       ``Right now I am just going to be a well-educated \n     mechanic,'' he said, his voice devoid of any emotion beyond \n     simple resignation. ``There is a point where you just have to \n     accept it. What Mark has to do over there is much worse and \n     much more of a sacrifice than whatever I have to give up \n     here.''\n       Two years into the war, many Americans have become numb to \n     the conflict in Iraq. Though the war is a nightly news event, \n     it is far away and is beyond any individual's control. But in \n     this small Vermont town, the war could not be more personal.\n       Town meetings now take place without Selectman Brian \n     Westcom, who also is the road commissioner. Chris Beaudry, \n     who works for the state highway department, was not around to \n     clear the roads during an especially snowy winter. \n     Firefighter Shawn Blake is gone along with LaRose, the \n     service station owner who also is the volunteer fire chief.\n       Dennis Sheridan will not be coaching soccer at the junior \n     high his son Tyler attends, and the school does not know who \n     will replace him. Jimmy Gleason, a school bus driver who also \n     maintained the fleet, is absent. The hunter safety class held \n     twice a year by Eric Chates--who also works as the mechanic \n     for the Enosburg Armory--has been canceled.\n       Each day brings new evidence of the men's absence: Wives \n     attend social functions alone. Children send sports scores by \n     e-mail to fathers who never missed a game until now. Elderly \n     parents arrange rides to doctors' appointments because their \n     sons are not there to drive them.\n       Businesses are stretched thin. Matt Tracy says his workload \n     at LaRose Texaco has tripled. Tammie Randall, hired strictly \n     to pump gas, keeps the books, handles the payroll and washes \n     the service vehicles.\n       Five of the 98 employees at Blue Seal Feeds are gone. An \n     electric candle glows in their honor at the main entrance to \n     the grain and animal feed company, and five enormous yellow \n     ribbons hang from a six-story silo.\n       ``Everyone is working extra hard, and we have gone to a \n     temp agency to try to fill the vacancies,'' said plant \n     manager Paul Adamczak. ``It affects us because we have lost \n     people with years of experience. You can't replace that. We \n     have lost skill, not just employees.''\n       Adamczak's son, Mike, 33, was among the plant workers \n     deployed.\n       Like the town, the father remains stoic. ``We're \n     Vermonters,'' Adamczak said. ``We're not the great vocal \n     communicators. This is something you think about, something \n     you feel every day--but something you don't say anything \n     about.''\n       Quietly, neighbors pitch in to help the families of those \n     who have left. Donna Magnant, a first-grade teacher's aide \n     whose husband, Raymond, and son Jon were deployed, said the \n     snow on her driveway and walkway seemed to magically \n     disappear all winter, as friends dropped by to shovel and \n     plow.\n       The Magnants were engaged to be married when Raymond went \n     to Vietnam with the Army almost 40 years ago, right out of \n     high school. Both have lived in Enosburg Falls their entire \n     lives.\n       ``Neither one of us, I am sure, thought we would have to \n     face something like this again,'' said Magnant, 58.\n       All 63 assigned members of Bravo Company are in Iraq. Of \n     the 25 support soldiers attached to the unit, most are \n     training at Camp Shelby, Miss., and will head to the Middle \n     East soon; a handful found they had medical conditions that \n     prevented them from serving overseas. The unit is scheduled \n     to be gone for 18 months. Though women have belonged to the \n     unit in the past, Bravo Company is all male at this time.\n       Bravo Company joined about 1,400 other members of the \n     Vermont Guard who had been called up in recent months, nearly \n     half the state's roster--making Vermont second only to Hawaii \n     in the per capita call-up of guardsmen. The Hawaiian units, \n     however, include people from other states. The Vermont \n     guardsmen come from their home state.\n       The average age of the men deployed from Bravo Company is \n     40, but some are old enough to have grandchildren. At least a \n     third have served in the Guard for 20 years or more.\n       Answering the call of their country is something people in \n     Enosburg Falls do, not something they question. If there is \n     opposition to the war, people keep it to themselves, \n     deferring to the prevailing sentiment of patriotism.\n       ``Most people around here would go if they were asked,'' \n     said Steve Tracy, who works at Blue Seal Feeds. ``Basically, \n     it is how we were brought up.''\n       Tracy, 55--no relation to Matt Tracy--has five family \n     members in the Guard: two sons, a nephew, a son-in-law and a \n     brother-in-law.\n       ``It has just become our community's price for the way we \n     live,'' said Adamczak, his boss. ``If you look at it any \n     other way, you are kidding yourself. Nobody is going to \n     protect our lifestyle if we don't do it. This is a necessary, \n     continuing commitment.''\n       As teller Jeannie West cashes paychecks and processes \n     mortgage payments at Merchants Bank on Main Street, she \n     glances at a snapshot thumbtacked to her work station. It \n     shows four men in camouflage--all family members who have \n     been called up. The last to be summoned was her son Joshua, \n     22, who left college in nearby Burlington when he was sent to \n     Iraq in January.\n       West, 49, considers it an honor when customers ask about \n     her son, and tell her they are proud that a boy from Enosburg \n     Falls is representing the United States in Iraq.\n       ``I could not imagine living somewhere where people did not \n     feel like this,'' she said.\n       Still, West said: ``The town seems sadder because everybody \n     talks about the guys who are gone. Everyone here went to \n     school with somebody in the Guard. Everybody knows someone. \n     Everyone is connected, somehow, to someone who is over \n     there.''\n       As their fathers and grandfathers did, many young people \n     here enlist in the military straight out of high school. When \n     they return home, they often join the Guard--signing up for \n     extra income, and for an opportunity to continue to serve.\n       Edward Grossman, principal of Enosburg Falls High School, \n     said support for the military effort was so strong that when \n     he surveyed his 375 students about starting an ROTC program, \n     half said they wanted one. The program will begin in the \n     fall.\n       When Bravo Company was deployed from St. Albans in \n     December, the students pressed so hard to see the ceremony \n     that Grossman arranged for a live broadcast in the school \n     auditorium. As cameras panned on the unit, Grossman, 55, \n     heard squeals of recognition: ``There's my cousin!'' \n     ``There's my brother!'' ``There's my dad!''\n       Enosburg Falls nestles in low hills in northwestern \n     Vermont, 10 miles from the Canadian border. Most of the town \n     was built in the 19th century, starting when the first dairy \n     farm was settled in 1806. In a quarter-mile commercial \n     district, Radio Shack and the Family Dollar store stand out \n     as franchises among locally owned enterprises like Leon's \n     Kitchen.\n       There is almost 100% employment. Three-quarters of the \n     population graduates from high school, going on to earn an \n     average annual income of $32,000. They are laborers at the \n     feed company and a pulp mill. They drive trucks. They are \n     mechanics, cashiers and office workers. Many work on dairy \n     farms. Some have jobs at an IBM plant 45 minutes away.\n       Enosburg Falls is surrounded by villages, bringing the \n     population of the region residents refer to as Enosburg to \n     about 2,500.\n       The area's uncommon stability has helped it withstand the \n     loss of the guardsmen. But there are signs everywhere that \n     the men are not forgotten.\n       Yellow ribbons cling to door knockers, lampposts and bay \n     windows. Nine houses on Duffy Hill, a 1\\1/2\\-mile road, are \n     draped with blue-star banners, indicating a soldier on active \n     duty. A nearby trailer boasts a sign: ``Gone to Iraq, Be Back \n     in 18 Months.''\n       Jars filled with pennies, nickels and dimes sit on office \n     counters. The coins pay for postage to send goodie boxes to \n     the guardsmen. Cars and pickups sport magnets honoring Bravo \n     Company. A busy local restaurant, the Abbey, offers 50% \n     discounts to Guard families.\n       Every other Saturday, Lise Gates, 50, turns her arcade and \n     bowling alley over to children of the guardsmen so their \n     mothers can have a break. Gates, who has no relatives in \n     Bravo Company, e-mails photographs of the kids at play to \n     their dads.\n       They thank her and she wonders why.\n       ``Why thank me, when they're the ones putting their lives \n     on the line so we can be safe?'' Gates said. ``I think a \n     majority of them wanted to go because they felt if they \n     didn't, a war was going to happen right here. A lot of us \n     here feel that way.''\n       The elementary school started its own support group for \n     Guard children.\n\n[[Page S11563]]\n\n     An English teacher at Enosburg Falls High assigned her \n     students to write an essay comparing a recent graduate--who \n     has served twice in Iraq--to Beowulf, a great Scandinavian \n     warrior from the 6th century. The graduate, Ben Pathode, has \n     two brothers at the school.\n       School secretary Debbie Shover's 22-year-old nephew is in \n     Iraq. Shover, 50, said that since the guardsmen shipped out \n     townspeople thought in terms of days, not months or years.\n       Enosburg Falls, she said, has unofficially adopted a new \n     way of telling time. ``Now, today, another day we can mark \n     off. And then, when they come home. Nothing in between.''\n       When a fire broke out on Main Street one cold night in \n     February, the guardsmen's absence seemed more glaring than \n     usual. The blaze demolished an entire block of eight \n     apartments and five businesses--among them, a furniture \n     company.\n       Firefighters converged from as far as Quebec. But LaRose, \n     the volunteer fire captain, was missing. LaRose, 49, Bravo \n     Company's command sergeant major, is known for his ability to \n     take charge in an emergency. He joined the Guard almost 30 \n     years ago.\n       ``We put the fire out,'' said Town Administrator Harold \n     Foote. ``But we really missed him.''\n       Foote, 49, said he was worried about what would happen when \n     the spring floods started. In the past, the Guard unit \n     stacked sandbags to halt onrushing waters. The June Dairy \n     Festival--the town's biggest event of the year--also concerns \n     him, because guardsmen traditionally manage the crowds and \n     traffic.\n       ``It sounds like small things, but it really confuses a \n     community when you are used to relying on a group of guys \n     like this,'' Foote said. ``And we haven't gone through a \n     whole year's cycle yet.''\n       LaRose's gas station, with its big red Texaco star sign, is \n     a local landmark--the only service station for miles where \n     customers can still get their gas pumped and their \n     windshields cleaned without getting out of their cars.\n       ``Mark kept it like that, religiously,'' Matt Tracy said. \n     He has vowed to maintain his boss' high service standards: \n     ``It is our responsibility to keep it like that until he gets \n     back.''\n       Tracy said he and his boss used to confer on minor problems \n     and emergencies alike. Now he has no one to turn to. ``Mark \n     was a leader,'' he said, ``not just with the National Guard \n     or the fire department. He was my leader too.''\n       As he tries to make the right decisions, Tracy asks \n     himself: What would Mark do?\n       Until now, Tracy said, he never realized how one man's \n     absence could make such a difference.\n\n                                S. 1888\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Family Support Act \n     of 2005''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROGRAMS FOR USE OF LEAVE BY CAREGIVERS FOR FAMILY \n                   MEMBERS OF INDIVIDUALS PERFORMING CERTAIN \n                   MILITARY SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Federal Employees Program.--\n       (1) Definitions.--In this subsection:\n       (A) Caregiver.--The term ``caregiver'' means an individual \n     who--\n       (i) is an employee;\n       (ii) is at least 21 years of age;

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, in introducing legislation that \nwould bring a small measure of relief to the families of our men and \nwomen in uniform as they seek to maintain a sense of normalcy here at \nhome while their loved ones are deployed in service to our country. Our \nongoing large-scale deployments in Iraq continue to demand so much from \nour men and women in uniform and their families. Passing this measure \nis the least we can do.\n  As part of the pre-deployment process, military personnel with \ndependent children or other dependent family members, such as elderly \nparents who require care, designate a caregiver for their dependents. \nThis person will act in the deployed personnel's place to provide care \nfor these family members during the period of deployment. The caregiver \ncould be a spouse, parent, sibling, or other responsible adult who is \ncapable of caring for, and willing to care for, the dependents in \nquestion.\n  The bill that we are introducing today, the Military Family Support \nAct, would create two programs to provide additional leave options for \npersons who have been designated as caregivers. The first program would \nrequire the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, to create a program \nunder which Federal employees who are designated as caregivers could \nuse accrued annual or sick leave, leave bank benefits, and other leave \navailable to them under Title 5 for purposes directly relating to or \nresulting from their designation as a caregiver.\n  This bill would also require the Secretary of Labor to establish a \nvoluntary program under which private sector companies would create \nsimilar programs for their employees and to solicit participation from \nprivate sector companies. I commend the many employers around the \ncountry for their understanding and support when an employee or a \nfamily member of an employee is called to active duty, and I hope that \ncompanies in Wisconsin and around the country will participate in this \nvoluntary program.\n  In addition, our bill would require the Government Accountability \nOffice to report to Congress with an evaluation of both the OPM program \nand the voluntary Department of Labor program. It is my hope that this \nevaluation will demonstrate the utility of such a leave program for \ndesignated caregivers and that these pilot programs could then be \nexpanded to the designated caregivers of additional deployed military \npersonnel.\n  This legislation builds on a measure that I introduced earlier this \nyear, S. 798, the Military Families Leave Act. This bill would provide \na similar benefit to military families by allowing eligible employees \nwhose spouses, parents, sons, or daughters are military personnel who \nare serving on or called to active duty in support of a contingency \noperation to use their Family and Medical Leave Act, FMLA, benefits for \nissues directly relating to or resulting from that deployment. These \ninstances could include preparation for deployment or additional \nresponsibilities that family members take on as a result of a loved \none's deployment, such as child care. I also introduced this bill \nduring the 108th Congress.\n  Let me be clear, that the legislation we are introducing today does \nnot amend the FMLA in any way. In fact, FMLA benefits are specifically \nexempted from the types of leave that can be used by designated \ncaregivers for purposes directly related to or resulting from their \ncaregiver responsibilities. While I believe that the FMLA could serve \nas the basis for providing additional leave opportunities for \ndesignated caregivers, opposition in some quarters to the original FMLA \nmakes this a difficult proposition. I am proud to have been a cosponsor \nof this landmark law, and I believe that the FMLA continues to provide \nmuch-needed assistance to millions of workers around the country as \nthey seek to care for their own serious health condition or that of a \nfamily member or as they welcome the birth or adoption of a child. I \nwill continue to support this law and efforts to ensure that the vital \nbenefits that it provides are not eroded.\n  I thank the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, for his work on this \nimportant measure, and I urge all of our colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL:\n  S. 1889. A bill to establish the Comprehensive Entitlement Reform \nCommission; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to create a \nbi-partisan Entitlement Reform Commission. The Commission will review \nAmerica's three major entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare \nand Medicaid, and make comprehensive recommendations to Congress and \nthe President that would sustain the solvency and stability of these \nthree programs for future generations. Representative John Tanner, D-\nTN, has joined me by introducing this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid have played a vital role for \nmillions of Americans to cope with the financial burdens of retirement \nand health care costs. However, over the next 75 years these three \nprograms represent a 42 trillion dollar unfunded commitment are on a \ntrajectory that cannot be sustained. The Social Security Trust Fund \nfaces a four trillion dollar unfunded commitment and will pay out more \nmoney than it takes in beginning in 2017; it will be exhausted in 2041. \nThe Medicare Part A Trust Fund, hospital insurance, faces an 8.6 \ntrillion dollar unfunded commitment and will be exhausted even sooner \nin 2020. The remainder of the 42 trillion dollar unfunded commitment \nincludes 12.4 trillion dollars for Medicare Part B, supplementary \nmedical insurance; 8.7 trillion dollars for Medicare Part D, \nprescription drugs; and 8.4 trillion dollars for Medicaid.\n  We have no idea where we are going to get the money to pay for these \ncommitments. We must deal with these challenges today while we still \nhave options so that our children will not be severely burdened with \npaying for huge entitlement commitments when they are competing in a \nfar more competitive world than exists today. To leave future \ngenerations in this predicament would be an irresponsible and colossal \nfailure of our generation.\n  Eight members will sit on the Commission established in my \nlegislation. The House Speaker, House Minority Leader, Senate Majority \nLeader and Senate Minority Leader will each appoint two members. \nMembers cannot be elected officials. The Commission will select two Co-\nChairmen from among its members and hire an Executive Director.\n  The Commission must submit its final report to the President and \nCongress one year after the selection of the two Co-Chairmen of the \nCommission and the Executive Director. Congress will hold Committee \nhearings to review the Commission's recommendations. The bill \nauthorizes 1.5 million dollars to carry out the Commission's tasks.\n  In March 2005, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan urged Congress \nto act on modernizing entitlement programs, ``sooner rather than \nlater.'' He warned that unless we act now to meet the huge unfunded \ncommitments of our entitlement programs, there will be significant \neconomic consequences for our nation. Dealing with this problem now \nmeans facing less dramatic and difficult choices down the road. The \nearlier we confront this reality, the more options we will have to \npursue a wise and sustainable course of action.\n  I am 59 years old. I am at the front end of the ``baby boom'' \ngeneration. My daughter is 15 years old and my son is 13 years old. I \ndon't want to fail their generation. That means addressing these \nentitlement programs now while we have time to do it in a responsible \nway. This is a defining debate for today's leaders. Doing nothing is \nirresponsible and cowardly. It is in every American's interest to deal \nwith this challenge now. We have it in us to do what needs to be done. \nI invite my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n\n[[Page S11565]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1890. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny a \ndeduction for certain fines, penalties, and other amounts; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today my good friends Senators Grassley \nand McCain and I are introducing the ``Government Settlement \nTransparency Act of 2005'', a bill that will put a stop to tax \ndeductions for fines and penalties paid by companies to government \nagencies in connection with civil settlements. Over the past several \nyears, we have become increasingly concerned about the approval of \nvarious settlements that allow penalty payments made to the government \nin settlement of a violation or potential violation of the law to be \ntax deductible. Our concerns were heightened this week upon the release \nof a Government Accountability Office Report that confirmed many \ncompanies deduct these settlements notwithstanding the tax code's \nprohibition against deducting fines and penalties. This abuse shifts \nthe tax burden from the wrongdoer onto the backs of the American \npeople. This is unacceptable.\n  Many government agencies enter into these settlement agreements after \ninvestigating companies for violations of the law. Every year thousands \nof violations are resolved with settlements totaling tens of billions \nof dollars paid to the Federal Government. Civil settlements serve to \npunish past wrongdoing and to deter future wrongdoing without \nprotracted court proceedings. For example, in the past several years \nsettlements of various SEC investigations into violations or potential \nviolations of the securities laws have been front and center in the \nnews. Through civil investigations, Federal and State regulators are \nworking hard to hold these firms responsible for their actions. With \nthese efforts to achieve greater accountability in the business \ncommunity and ensure the integrity of our financial markets, it is \nimportant that the rules governing the appropriate tax treatment of \nsettlements be clear and adhered to by taxpayers.\n  Section 162(f) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that no \ndeduction is allowed as a trade or business expense under section \n162(a) for the payment of a fine or penalty to a government for \nviolation of any law. The enactment of section 162(f) in 1969 codified \nexisting case law that denied the deductibility of fines and penalties \nas ordinary and necessary business expenses on the grounds that \n``allowance of the deduction would frustrate sharply defined national \nor state policies proscribing the particular types of conduct evidenced \nby some governmental declaration thereof.'' Treasury regulations \nprovide that a fine or penalty includes an amount paid in settlement of \nthe taxpayer's actual or potential liability for a fine or penalty.\n  The legislation introduced today modifies the rules regarding the \ndetermination of whether payments are nondeductible payments of fines \nor penalties under section 162(f). In particular, the bill generally \nprovides that amounts paid or incurred whether by suit, agreement, or \notherwise, to, or at the direction of, a government in relation to the \nviolation of any law or the investigation or inquiry in the potential \nviolation of any law are nondeductible. The bill applies to deny a \ndeduction for any such payments, including those where there is no \nadmission of guilt or liability and those made for the purpose of \navoiding further investigation or litigation.\n  An exception applies to payments that the taxpayer establishes are \neither restitution, including remediation of property, or amounts \nrequired to come into compliance with any law that was violated, and \nthat are so identified in the settlement agreement. It is intended that \na payment will be treated as restitution only if the payment is \nrequired to be paid to the specific persons, or in relation to the \nspecific property, actually harmed by the conduct of the taxpayer that \nresulted in the payment. Restitution does not include reimbursement of \ngovernment investigative or litigation costs, or payments to \nwhistleblowers. It is intended that a payment will be treated as an \namount required to come into compliance only if it directly corrects a \nviolation with respect to a particular requirement of law that was \nunder investigation. Amounts paid to educate consumers or customers \nabout the risks of doing business with the taxpayer or about the field \nin which the taxpayer generally does business, and which are not \nspecifically required under the law, are not deductible if required \nunder a settlement agreement.\n  To ensure that companies do not take unallowable tax deductions for \nsettlement payments, the bill requires government agencies to report to \nthe IRS and to the taxpayer within thirty days of the settlement the \namount of each settlement agreement, and to identify whether the \npayment is for fines, restitution, remediation or compliance, where the \naggregate amount of the settlement is at least six hundred dollars, the \nSecretary of the Treasury will have the authority to adjust the amount \nand deadline for filing. Further, the IRS is encouraged to require \ntaxpayers to separately identify such settlements on their tax returns.\n  The bill would be effective for amounts paid or incurred on or after \nthe date of enactment unless the amounts were under binding order or \nagreement before such date.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Committee on Taxation \nTechnical Description and the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Denial of Deduction for Certain Fines, Penalties, and Other Amounts\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, no deduction is allowed as a trade or \n     business expense under section 162(a) for the payment of a \n     fine or similar penalty to a government for the violation of \n     any law (sec. 162(f)). The enactment of section 162(f) in \n     1969 codified existing case law that denied the deductibility \n     of fines as ordinary and necessary business expenses on the \n     grounds that ``allowance of the deduction would frustrate \n     sharply defined national or State policies proscribing the \n     particular types of conduct evidenced by some governmental \n     declaration thereof.''\n       Treasury regulation section 1.162-21(b)(1) provides that a \n     fine or similar penalty includes an amount: (1) Paid pursuant \n     to conviction or a plea of guilty or nolo contendere for a \n     crime (felony or misdemeanor) in a criminal proceeding; (2) \n     paid as a civil penalty imposed by Federal, State, or local \n     law, including additions to tax and additional amounts and \n     assessable penalties imposed by chapter 68 of the Code; (3) \n     paid in settlement of the taxpayer's actual or potential \n     liability for a fine or penalty (civil or criminal); or (4) \n     forfeited as collateral posted in connection with a \n     proceeding which could result in imposition of such a fine or \n     penalty. Treasury regulation section 1.162-21(b)(2) provides, \n     among other things, that compensatory damages (including \n     damages under section 4A of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. 15a), \n     as amended) paid to a government do not constitute a fine or \n     penalty.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Chanee\n\n       There is a lack of clarity and consistency under present \n     law regarding when taxpayers may deduct payments made in \n     settlement of government investigations of potential \n     wrongdoing, as well as in situations where there has been a \n     final determination of wrongdoing. If a taxpayer deducts \n     payments made in settlement of an investigation of potential \n     wrongdoing or as a result of a finding of wrongdoing, the \n     publicly announced amount of the settlement payment does not \n     reflect the true after-tax penalty on the taxpayer. Allowing \n     a deduction for such payments in effect shifts a portion of \n     the penalty to the Federal government and to the public.\n\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The bill modifies the rules regarding the determination \n     whether payments are nondeductible payments of fines or \n     penalties under section 162(f). In particular, the bill \n     generally provides that amounts paid or incurred (whether by \n     suit, agreement, or otherwise) to, or at the direction of, a \n     government in relation to the violation of any law or the \n     investigation or inquiry into the potential violation of any \n     law are nondeductible under any provision of the income tax \n     provisions. The bill applies to deny a deduction for any \n     such payments, including those where there is no admission \n     of guilt or liability and those made for the purpose of \n     avoiding further investigation or litigation. An exception \n     applies to payments that the taxpayer establishes are \n     either restitution (including remediation of property), or \n     amounts required to come into compliance with any law that \n     was violated or involved in the investigation or inquiry, \n     and that are identified in the court order or settlement \n     as restitution, remediation, or required to come into \n     compliance. The IRS remains free to challenge the \n     characterization of an amount so identified; however, no \n     deduction is allowed unless the identification is made.\n       An exception also applies to any amount paid or incurred as \n     taxes due.\n       The bill is intended to apply only where a government (or \n     other entity treated in a\n\n[[Page S11566]]\n\n     manner similar to a government under the amendment) is a \n     complainant or investigator with respect to the violation or \n     potential violation of any law.\n       It is intended that a payment will be treated as \n     restitution (including remediation of property) only if \n     substantially all of the payment is required to be paid to \n     the specific persons, or in relation to the specific \n     property, actually harmed by the conduct of the taxpayer that \n     resulted in the payment. Thus, a payment to or with respect \n     to a class substantially broader than the specific persons or \n     property that were actually harmed (e.g., to a class \n     including similarly situated persons or property) does not \n     qualify as restitution or included remediation of \n     property. Restitution and included remediation of property \n     is limited to the amount that bears a substantial \n     quantitative relationship to the harm caused by the past \n     conduct or actions of the taxpayer that resulted in the \n     payment in question. If the party harmed is a government \n     or other entity, then restitution and included remediation \n     of property includes payment to such harmed government or \n     entity, provided the payment bears a substantial \n     quantitative relationship to the harm. However, \n     restitution or included remediation of property does not \n     include reimbursement of government investigative or \n     litigation costs, or payments to whistleblowers.\n       It is intended that a payment will be treated as an amount \n     required to come into compliance only if it directly corrects \n     a violation with respect to a particular requirement of law \n     that was under investigation. For example, if the law \n     requires a particular emission standard to be met or \n     particular machinery to be used, amounts required to be paid \n     under a settlement agreement to meet the required standard or \n     install the machinery are deductible to the extent otherwise \n     allowed. Similarly, if the law requires certain practices and \n     procedures to be followed and a settlement agreement requires \n     the taxpayer to pay to establish such practices or \n     procedures, such amounts would be deductible. However, \n     amounts paid for other purposes not directly correcting a \n     violation of law are not deductible. For example, amounts \n     paid to bring other machinery that is already in compliance \n     up to a standard higher than required by the law, or to \n     create other benefits (such as a park or other action not \n     previously required by law), are not deductible if required \n     under a settlement agreement. Similarly, amounts paid to \n     educate consumers or customers about the risks of doing \n     business with the taxpayer or about the field in which the \n     taxpayer does business generally, which education efforts are \n     not specifically required under the law, are not deductible \n     if required under a settlement agreement.\n       The bill requires government agencies to report to the IRS \n     and to the taxpayer the amount of each settlement agreement \n     or order entered where the aggregate amount required to be \n     paid or incurred to or at the direction of the government \n     under such settlement agreements and orders with respect to \n     the violation, investigation, or inquiry is least $600 (or \n     such other amount as may be specified by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury as necessary to ensure the efficient administration \n     of the Internal Revenue laws). The reports must be made \n     within 30 days of entering the settlement agreement, or such \n     other time as may be required by Secretary. The report must \n     separately identify any amounts that are restitution or \n     remediation of property, or correction of noncompliance.\n       The IRS is encouraged in addition to require taxpayers to \n     identify separately on their tax returns the amounts of any \n     such settlements with respect to which reporting is required \n     under the bill, including separate identification of the \n     nondeductible amount and of any amount deductible as \n     restitution, remediation, or required to correct \n     noncompliance.\n       Amounts paid or incurred (whether by suit, agreement, or \n     otherwise) to, or at the direction of, any self-regulatory \n     entity that regulates a financial market or other market that \n     is a qualified board or exchange under section 1256(g)(7), \n     and that is authorized to impose sanctions (e.g., the \n     National Association of Securities Dealers) are likewise \n     subject to the provision if paid in relation to a violation, \n     or investigation or inquiry into a potential violation, of \n     any law (or any rule or other requirement of such entity). To \n     the extent provided in regulations, amounts paid or incurred \n     to, or at the direction of, any other nongovernmental entity \n     that exercises self-regulatory powers as part of performing \n     an essential governmental function are similarly subject to \n     the provision. The exception for payments that the taxpayer \n     establishes are paid or incurred for restitution, remediation \n     of property, or coming into compliance and that are \n     identified as such in the order or settlement agreement \n     likewise applies in these cases. The requirement of reporting \n     to the IRS and the taxpayer also applies in these cases.\n       No inference is intended as to the treatment of payments as \n     nondeductible fines or penalties under present law. In \n     particular, the bill is not intended to limit the scope of \n     present-law section 162(f) or the regulations thereunder.\n\n\n                             Effective date\n\n       The bill is effective for amounts paid or incurred on or \n     after the date of enactment; however the bill does not apply \n     to amounts paid or incurred under any binding order or \n     agreement entered into before such date.

A bill to amend Public Law 107-153 to modify a certain date; \nto the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a measure with \nSenator Dorgan to amend P.L. 107-153, which deems that certain reports \nprepared for the Department of the Interior relating to Indian tribal \ntrust accounts were received by the tribes no earlier than December 31, \n1999. The intent of this law was to eliminate contentions that the \ntribes received notice of potential claims against the United States \nprior to that date for purposes of the statute of limitations. This \namendment changes the date set forth in P.L. 107-153 to December 31, \n2005, in order to facilitate discussions and negotiations between the \nIndian tribes and the United States regarding potential claims without \npressure on the tribes to file lawsuits out of concern that the statute \nof limitations will run out on their claims. It is my understanding \nthat this measure has support both among the Indian tribes and the \nadministration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1893. A bill to permit biomedical research corporations to engage \nin certain financings and other transactions without incurring \nlimitations on net operating loss carryforwards and certain built-in \nlosses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nBiotechnology Future Investment Expansion Act of 2005.\n  Biotechnology has resulted in some of the most important innovations \nof our time. Substantive research in agriculture, bioengineering, and \nmedicine have given Americans a better life. From the discovery of DNA \nto the creation of synthetic insulin, biotechnology has improved the \nstandard of living and has saved many lives. It is important that we \nencourage continued research to further advances in the biotech field.\n  The biotech industry is one of the most research-intensive industries \nin the world. The industry spent $17.9 billion on research and \ndevelopment in 2003 alone. The overwhelming majority of biotech \ncompanies engaged in this research are not profitable in the early \nyears of development. Such companies may accumulate net operating \nlosses NOLs, without earning income, for a decade or more. \nUnfortunately, a provision of the tax code, (Section 382), operates to \nseverely limit the utilization of NOLs by many such biotech companies. \nOften, these limitations cause NOLs to expire before they can be used \nby these companies.\n  This legislation will modify the application of Section 382 to the \nbiotech industry, with the goal of increasing that important sector's \nability to leverage capital into high-tech, high-risk cutting-edge \nresearch. Specifically, the legislation will ensure that neither new \ninvestment into biotech companies nor a business-driven merger of two \nbiotech loss companies will trigger the section 382 NOL limitation. \nNeither of these changes runs counter to the long-standing tax policy \nbehind Section 382 of preventing corporations, from NOL trafficking.\n  My home State of Pennsylvania is a national leader in biotechnology \ninnovation, and the biosciences are a significant economic driver in \nPennsylvania's economy. Pennsylvania's support of the industry has made \nit a policy leader for the biosciences. More than 125 biopharmaceutical \ncompanies and 2,000 bioscience-related companies make Pennsylvania \ntheir home. For example, Philadelphia's BioAdvance focuses on \nbioinformatics, bio-pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and clinical \ntrials. The Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse focuses on drug \ndiscovery tools, tissue and organ research, medical devices, and \ntherapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders. The Central \nPennsylvania Life Sciences Greenhouse is pursuing drug design and \ndelivery systems, biomedical devices, and bio-nanotechnology. These and \nmany other companies in Pennsylvania are developing ground-breaking \ntherapies, devices, diagnostics and vaccines for once untreatable \ndiseases and debilitating conditions, providing hope for millions of \npatients.\n  Additionally, top-of-the-line bioscience research takes place in \nPennsylvania's academic institutions. Pennsylvania researchers garnered \n$1.3 billion in funding through the I.-- National Institutes of Health \nin 2003, making the Commonwealth fourth in the Nation. And the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and the University of Pittsburgh are in the \ntop 10 nationally for NIH funding.\n  We must encourage continued research and the funding that supports \nit. Biotech companies are pursuing high-risk research projects to find \ncures for many deadly and debilitating diseases that afflict humanity. \nFrom cancer to AIDS, and from Alzheimer's Disease to Parkinson' \nDisease, the biotechnology industry will be in the center of finding \ncures to these life-ending illnesses. My legislation offers a little \nmore support to an industry we depend upon. I encourage my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this legislation and ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1893\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to return meaning to the fifth amendment by limiting \nthe power of eminent domain; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of every person in \nAmerica who owns property and to speak on behalf of everyone working \ntoward the American dream of homeownership. That dream is being \nthreatened today, and that threat comes from our own government and \ncourt system. Since the birth of our Nation, property ownership has \nbeen a fundamental and guarded right. The Founding Fathers went to \ngreat lengths to protect citizens from the heavy and greedy hand of \ngovernment. This is why the Bill of Rights includes the fifth \namendment's ``takings clause.''\n  Unfortunately, 200 years of upholding property rights was not enough \nto protect some Americans from the excessive use of government power. \nIn Kelo v. City of New London, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that \neconomic development was a sufficient reason to take a person's \nproperty. In this case, the city of New London, CT wanted to tear down \nprivate homes and redevelop private property into an industrial \ncomplex. It is important to understand that the city did not want to \ntear down these homes because the neighborhood was blighted. The city \ndid not want to redevelop the property because the homes were being \nused by drug dealers. The homeowners were middle-class families living \nin a middle-class neighborhood. So why would the city want to redevelop \nthese properties? City officials believed this would create jobs and \nincrease the city's tax revenue. When the homeowners refused to sell to \nthe city, the city began condemnation proceedings. The homeowners sued \nthe city and argued that this ``taking'' violated their fifth amendment \nrights.\n  The fifth amendment states that private property cannot be taken \nexcept for a ``public use'' and only then if the owners are justly \ncompensated. The owners believed, as I do, that creating jobs and \nincreasing tax revenue is not a public use. The Supreme Court, despite \nthe plain meaning of the fifth amendment, ruled against the homeowners. \nAs bad as that is, it gets worse for these homeowners. The city of New \nLondon is demanding that the homeowners, those who fought to protect \ntheir fifth amendment rights, must now pay back rent. For the Kelo \nfamily, that means $57,000 in rent owed to the city.\n  This cannot be what the Founding Fathers intended when they adopted \nthe Bill of Rights. The Kelo decision has highlighted a serious problem \nwith how government has taken more power at the expense of the people. \nThe Supreme Court's decision favors big corporations and persons with \npolitical clout over homeowners and regular people.\n  Congress is partly to blame. Congress has created incentives for \ngovernment to redevelop property in a never-ending quest for more and \nmore tax dollars. New London, CT is the perfect example of these \nincentives. To Americans, the Kelo decision means that no matter how \nhard you work and no matter how hard you save, government can come in \nand take it all away from you. No person's home will be safe if \nCongress does not act to restore the fifth amendment. The property \nowners who lost their homes as a result of the Kelo decision paid their \nFederal taxes, paid their State taxes, and paid their local taxes. They \nplayed by the rules. Ironically, it was these taxes that made it \npossible for their government to steal their homes. As a result, \nCongress must step in to limit the use of Federal dollars.\n  Just as our country's Founders sought to protect private property by \namending the Constitution, I feel Congress must act to protect those \nrights. That is why I am introducing the Private Property Rights \nProtection Act, legislation to protect and preserve the American dream. \nThis bill will curb government power and return it where it belongs, to \nthe people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1897. A bill to amend the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources \nPlanning Act of 1974 and related laws to strengthen the protection of \nnative biodiversity and ban clearcutting on Federal land, and to \ndesignate certain Federal land as Ancient forests, roadless areas, \nwatershed protection areas, and special areas where logging and other \nintrusive activities are prohibited; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Act to Save \nAmerica's Forests. The purpose of this legislation is to protect our \nnational forests from needless clearcutting, safeguard our roadless \nareas, and preserve the last remaining stands of ancient forests in \nthis country.\n  At one time there was approximately billions of acres of forest on \nthe land that is now the United States. Sadly, less than 10 percent of \nthe original unlogged forests of the United States remain, and in the \nlower 48 States only 1 percent is in a form large enough to support all \nthe native plants and animals. The 1 percent left is under constant \nthreat, so we must act as soon as possible to keep us from losing these \nprecious forest lands forever.\n  Our national forests also are under attack from clearcutting. The \nprocess\n\n[[Page S11569]]\n\nof clearcutting, or removing huge groups of trees at once, devastates \nwildlife habitats, creates a blighted landscape, increases soil \nerosion, and degrades water quality. Over a quarter-million acres of \nour national forests were clearcut in the past decade alone. The \nprocess of clearcutting annihilates vibrant, ecologically diverse \nforests are usually replaced, if at all, with a single species tree \nfarm. This is irresponsible forest management that ignores ecology and \nconcentrates solely on flawed economics.\n  This bill utilizes a scientific approach to forest management. By \nbanning all logging operations in roadless areas, ancient forests, and \nforests that have extraordinary biological, scenic, or recreational \nvalues, this bill seeks to protect our Nation's most precious and \nfragile ecosystems. In addition, this bill bans clearcutting in our \nnational forests except in specific cases where complete removal of \nnonnative invasive tree species is ecologically necessary.\n  While the bill bans certain logging, it does not ban all logging in \nour national forests. Instead, it allows a method of logging called \nselection management, which cuts individual trees instead of the whole \nforest, leaving a healthy, biologically diverse forest ecosystem. This \nmethod reduces the devastation to the environment because it retains \nnatural forest structure and function, focuses on long-term rather than \nshort-term management, and allows new growth without completely \ndestroying old growth. It is also less disturbing to people who enjoy \nthe scenic beauty of our forests. Not only is selection management more \nenvironmentally friendly, but it also can be sustainable and even \nprofitable, as demonstrated by a number of private forests around the \ncountry.\n  This legislation emphasizes biodiversity and sustainable management, \nallowing ecologically sound logging practices in some of our national \nforestland and fully protecting the rest. I am proud to reintroduce \nthis legislation in the 109th Congress, which will be a major step in \nthe protection of America's forests. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) Federal agencies that permit clearcutting and other \n     forms of even-age logging operations include the Forest \n     Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the \n     Bureau of Land Management;\n       (2) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations cause substantial alterations in native \n     biodiversity by--\n       (A) emphasizing the production of a limited number of \n     commercial species, and often only a single species, of trees \n     on each site;\n       (B) manipulating the vegetation toward greater relative \n     density of the commercial species;\n       (C) suppressing competing species; and\n       (D) requiring the planting, on numerous sites, of a \n     commercial strain of the species that reduces the relative \n     diversity of other genetic strains of the species that were \n     traditionally located on the same sites;\n       (3) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations--\n       (A) frequently lead to the death of immobile species and \n     the very young of mobile species of wildlife; and\n       (B) deplete the habitat of deep-forest species of animals, \n     including endangered species and threatened species;\n       (4)(A) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations--\n       (i) expose the soil to direct sunlight and the impact of \n     precipitation;\n       (ii) disrupt the soil surface;\n       (iii) compact organic layers; and\n       (iv) disrupt the run-off restraining capabilities of roots \n     and low-lying vegetation, resulting in soil erosion, the \n     leaching of nutrients, a reduction in the biological content \n     of soil, and the impoverishment of soil; and\n       (B) all of the consequences described in subparagraph (A) \n     have a long-range deleterious effect on all land resources, \n     including timber production;\n       (5) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations aggravate global climate change by--\n       (A) decreasing the capability of the soil to retain carbon; \n     and\n       (B) during the critical periods of felling and site \n     preparation, reducing the capacity of the biomass to process \n     and to store carbon, with a resultant loss of stored carbon \n     to the atmosphere;\n       (6) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations render soil increasingly sensitive to acid \n     deposits by causing a decline of soil wood and coarse woody \n     debris;\n       (7) a decline of solid wood and coarse woody debris reduces \n     the capacity of soil to retain water and nutrients, which in \n     turn increases soil heat and impairs soil's ability to \n     maintain protective carbon compounds on the soil surface;\n       (8) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations result in--\n       (A) increased stream sedimentation and the silting of \n     stream bottoms;\n       (B) a decline in water quality;\n       (C) the impairment of life cycles and spawning processes of \n     aquatic life from benthic organisms to large fish; and\n       (D) as a result of the effects described in subparagraphs \n     (A) through (C), a depletion of the sport and commercial \n     fisheries of the United States;\n       (9) clearcutting and other forms of even-age management of \n     Federal forests disrupt natural disturbance regimes that are \n     critical to ecosystem function;\n       (10) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations increase harmful edge effects, including--\n       (A) blowdowns;\n       (B) invasions by weed species; and\n       (C) heavier losses to predators and competitors;\n       (11) by reducing the number of deep, canopied, variegated, \n     permanent forests, clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations--\n       (A) limit areas where the public can satisfy an expanding \n     need for recreation; and\n       (B) decrease the recreational value of land;\n       (12) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations replace forests described in paragraph (11) with a \n     surplus of clearings that grow into relatively impenetrable \n     thickets of saplings, and then into monoculture tree \n     plantations;\n       (13) because of the harmful and, in many cases, \n     irreversible, damage to forest species and forest ecosystems \n     caused by logging of Ancient and roadless forests, \n     clearcutting, and other forms of even-age management, it is \n     important that these practices be halted based on the \n     precautionary principle;\n       (14) human beings depend on native biological resources, \n     including plants, animals, and micro-organisms--\n       (A) for food, medicine, shelter, and other important \n     products; and\n       (B) as a source of intellectual and scientific knowledge, \n     recreation, and aesthetic pleasure;\n       (15) alteration of native biodiversity has serious \n     consequences for human welfare, as the United States \n     irretrievably loses resources for research and agricultural, \n     medicinal, and industrial development;\n       (16) alteration of biodiversity in Federal forests \n     adversely affects the functions of ecosystems and critical \n     ecosystem processes that--\n       (A) moderate climate;\n       (B) govern nutrient cycles and soil conservation and \n     production;\n       (C) control pests and diseases; and\n       (D) degrade wastes and pollutants;\n       (17)(A) clearcutting and other forms of even-age management \n     operations have significant deleterious effects on native \n     biodiversity, by reducing habitat and food for cavity-nesting \n     birds and insectivores such as the 3-toed woodpecker and \n     hairy woodpecker and for neotropical migratory bird species; \n     and\n       (B) the reduction in habitat and food supply could disrupt \n     the lines of dependency among species and their food \n     resources and thereby jeopardize critical ecosystem function, \n     including limiting outbreaks of destructive insect \n     populations; for example--\n       (i) the 3-toed woodpecker requires clumped snags in spruce-\n     fir forests, and 99 percent of\n\n[[Page S11570]]\n\n     its winter diet is composed of insects, primarily spruce \n     beetles; and\n       (ii) a 3-toed woodpecker can consume as much as 26 percent \n     of the brood of an endemic population of spruce bark beetle \n     and reduce brood survival of the population by 70 to 79 \n     percent;\n       (18) the harm of clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations on the natural resources of the United \n     States and the quality of life of the people of the United \n     States is substantial, severe, and avoidable;\n       (19) by substituting selection management, as required by \n     this Act, for clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations, the Federal agencies involved with those \n     logging operations would substantially reduce devastation to \n     the environment and improve the quality of life of the people \n     of the United States;\n       (20) selection management--\n       (A) retains natural forest structure and function;\n       (B) focuses on long-term rather than short-term management;\n       (C) works with, rather than against, the checks and \n     balances inherent in natural processes; and\n       (D) permits the normal, natural processes in a forest to \n     allow the forest to go through the natural stages of \n     succession to develop a forest with old growth ecological \n     functions;\n       (21) by protecting native biodiversity, as required by this \n     Act, Federal agencies would maintain vital native ecosystems \n     and improve the quality of life of the people of the United \n     States;\n       (22) selection logging--\n       (A) is more job intensive, and therefore provides more \n     employment than clearcutting and other forms of even-age \n     logging operations to manage the same quantity of timber \n     production; and\n       (B) produces higher quality sawlogs than clearcutting and \n     other forms of even-age logging operations; and\n       (23) the judicial remedies available to enforce Federal \n     forest laws are inadequate, and should be strengthened by \n     providing for injunctions, declaratory judgments, statutory \n     damages, and reasonable costs of suit.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to conserve native \n     biodiversity and protect all native ecosystems on all Federal \n     land against losses that result from--\n       (1) clearcutting and other forms of even-age logging \n     operations; and\n       (2) logging in Ancient forests, roadless areas, watershed \n     protection areas, and special areas.\n\n                        TITLE I--LAND MANAGEMENT\n\n     SEC. 101.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in accordance with the Act of June 8, 1906 (16 U.S.C. \n     431 et seq.), the Giant Sequoia National Monument was created \n     by presidential proclamation on April 15, 2000;\n       (2) the Proclamation accurately states the following: ``The \n     rich and varied landscape of the Giant Sequoia National \n     Monument holds a diverse array of scientific and historic \n     resources. Magnificent groves of towering giant sequoias, the \n     world's largest trees, are interspersed within a great belt \n     of coniferous forest, jeweled with mountain meadows. Bold \n     granitic domes and spires, and plunging gorges, texture the \n     landscape. The area's elevation climbs from about 2,500 to \n     9,700 feet over a distance of only a few miles, capturing an \n     extraordinary number of habitats within a relatively small \n     area. This spectrum of ecosystems is home to a diverse array \n     of plants and animals, many of which are rare or endemic to \n     the southern Sierra Nevada. The monument embraces limestone \n     caverns and holds unique paleological resources documenting \n     tens of thousands of years of ecosystem change. The monument \n     also has many archaeological sites recording Native American \n     occupation and adaptations to this complex landscape, and \n     historic remnants of early Euroamerican settlement as well as \n     the commercial exploitation of the giant sequoias. The \n     monument provides exemplary opportunities for biologists, \n     geologists, paleontologists, archaeologists, and historians \n     to study these objects.'' ;\n       (3) the various ecosystems cited as the basis for \n     establishment of the Monument--\n       (A) extend beyond the existing boundaries of the Monument; \n     and\n       (B) encompass the fragile and extremely diverse southern \n     Sierra Nevada bioregion and the overlapping Mohave ecosystem;\n       (4) to protect all the ecosystems and objects described in \n     the Proclamation, the boundaries of the Monument must be \n     extended to provide for watershed integrity, seasonal \n     wildlife migrations, and other benefits;\n       (5) even though the primary reason for establishing the \n     Monument was to rescue the area from the effects of road \n     building and severe logging implemented by the Forest \n     Service, the Proclamation left the Monument under the \n     jurisdiction of the Chief of the Forest Service;\n       (6) the Proclamation provides the following: ``No portion \n     of the Monument shall be considered to be suited for timber \n     production, and no part of the Monument shall be used in a \n     calculation or provision of a sustained yield of timber from \n     the Sequoia National Forest.'';\n       (7) the Proclamation provided that ``[t]hese forests [in \n     the Monument] need restoration to counteract the effects of a \n     century of fire suppression and logging'';\n       (8) throughout the history of the Forest Service, the \n     Forest Service has been focused on the logging of Federal \n     land for the purpose of selling timber;\n       (9) because of this emphasis on logging and for other \n     reasons, the National Park Service would be better able to \n     manage the Monument than the Forest Service;\n       (10) the National Park Service manages 73 national \n     monuments, many of which were originally under the \n     jurisdiction of the Forest Service and were later transferred \n     to the National Park System by an Act of Congress or by \n     Executive Order;\n       (11) national monuments were managed by different Federal \n     agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, until \n     1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt consolidated the \n     management of national monuments in the National Park Service \n     through Executive Order 6166 of June 10, 1933, and Executive \n     Order 6228 of July 28, 1933;\n       (12) in most cases, national monuments established by \n     presidential proclamation and assigned to the Forest Service \n     or other Federal agencies have been ultimately transferred to \n     the Secretary of the Interior, to be managed by the National \n     Park Service;\n       (13) in a number of cases, Congress has eventually \n     converted national monuments under the jurisdiction of the \n     National Park Service into national parks;\n       (14) national monuments that were converted into national \n     parks include the Grand Canyon National Park, Olympic \n     National Park, and Death Valley National Park;\n       (15) Congress has converted large areas of national forests \n     into some of the national parks and national monuments most \n     cherished by the people of the United States;\n       (16) prominent examples of conversions in the region of the \n     Monument are--\n       (A) Kings Canyon National Park, which was created out of \n     the Sierra National Forest and Sequoia National Forest in \n     1940;\n       (B) the major eastward extension doubling the size of \n     Sequoia National Park in 1926, with land for the addition \n     being taken from the Sequoia National Forest; and\n       (C) the Mineral King addition to the Sequoia National Park \n     in 1978, with land for the addition being taken from Sequoia \n     National Forest;\n       (17) the Monument has more acres of sequoia groves than are \n     contained in Sequoia, Kings Canyon, Yosemite, and Calaveras \n     Big Tree, which are the only national parks and State parks \n     in which sequoias occur;\n       (18) the largest tree in the world may still await \n     discovery in some remote area of the Monument;\n       (19) to save the ecological integrity of the Monument, it \n     is essential that the approximately 40,640 acres of land \n     between the Western Divide (commonly known as the ``Greenhorn \n     Mountains'') and the center line of the Kern River, south to \n     the boundary line between Tulare and Kern counties, be \n     included in the monument;\n       (20) Sequoia National Forest land, north of Sequoia \n     National Park, should be added to the Sierra National Forest, \n     which adjoins the Sierra National Forest on the north;\n       (21) for reasons of accessibility, economy, and general \n     efficiency of operation, the remaining Sequoia National \n     Forest territory south of Sequoia National Park belongs in \n     the Inyo National Forest, which already shares the Golden \n     Trout Wilderness with the Sequoia National Forest; and\n       (22) the overlapping jurisdiction with respect to the \n     Sequoia National Forest territory results in needlessly \n     wasteful management procedures.\n\n     SEC. 402. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Advisory board.--The term ``Advisory Board'' means the \n     Giant Sequoia National Monument Advisory Board established \n     under section 404(d)(1).\n       (2) Management plan.--The term ``management plan'' means \n     the management plan for the Monument required by the \n     Proclamation.\n       (3) Monument.--The term ``Monument'' means the Giant \n     Sequoia National Monument established by the Proclamation.\n       (4) Proclamation.--The term ``Proclamation'' means the \n     Presidential Proclamation number 7295, dated April 15, 2000 \n     (65 Fed.

Johnson established the \n     President's Commission on White House Fellowships, through \n     Executive Order 11183, to create a program that would select \n     between 11 and 19 outstanding young Americans every year and \n     bring them to Washington for ``first hand, high-level \n     experience in the workings of the Federal Government, to \n     establish an era when the young men and women of America and \n     their government belonged to each other--belonged to each \n     other in fact and in spirit'';\n       Whereas the White House Fellows Program has steadfastly \n     remained a nonpartisan program that has served 8 Presidents \n     exceptionally well;\n       Whereas the nearly 600 White House Fellows that have \n     served, have established a legacy of leadership in every \n     aspect of American society that includes appointments as \n     Cabinet officials and senior White House staff, election to \n     the House of Representatives, Senate, and State and local \n     Government, appointments to the Federal, State, and local \n     judiciary, appointments as United States Attorneys, \n     leadership in many of the Nation's largest corporations and \n     law firms, service as presidents of colleges and \n     universities, deans of our most distinguished graduate \n     schools, officials in nonprofit organizations, distinguished \n     scholars and historians, and service as senior leaders in \n     every branch of the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas this legacy of leadership is a national resource \n     that has been used by the Nation in major challenges \n     including organizing resettlement operations following the \n     Vietnam War, assisting with the national response to \n     terrorist attacks, managing the aftermath of natural \n     disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and reforming \n     and innovating in national and international securities and \n     capital markets;\n       Whereas the nearly 600 White House Fellows have \n     characterized their post-Fellowship years with a lifetime \n     commitment to public service through continuing personal and \n     professional renewal and association, creating a Fellows \n     community of mutual support for leadership at every level of \n     government and in every element of our national life; and\n       Whereas September 1, 2005, marked the 40th anniversary of \n     the first class of White House Fellows to serve this Nation: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 40th anniversary of the White House \n     Fellows program and commends the White House Fellows for \n     their continuing lifetime commitment to public service;\n       (2) acknowledges the legacy of leadership provided by White \n     House Fellows over the years in their local communities, the \n     Nation, and the world; and\n       (3) expresses appreciation and support for the continuing \n     leadership of White House Fellows in all aspects of our \n     national life in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2005/10/19/senate-section/article/S11579-4", "month": "10", "year": "2005", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11579-S11580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2112.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 1894 introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1894) to amend part E of title IV of the Social \n     Security Act to provide for the making of foster care \n     maintenance payments to private for-profit agencies.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Fair Access \nFoster Care Act of 2005.\n  Therapeutic foster care is foster care for children with special \nmedical, psychological, emotional, and social needs. These children \nneed comprehensive support and attention, requiring a great deal of \ncommitment and sacrifice from foster care parents.\n  Prior to the placement of a child, a potential therapeutic foster \ncare parent must complete a certification process that involves a \nbackground check, a training program, and at least two home studies.\n  At Choices for Life Foster Care, Inc., a for-profit provider in \nOklahoma City, counselors are in the home a minimum of 2 hours every \nother week once a child has been placed.\n  Generally therapeutic foster care children are not permitted to \nattend daycare and require ``line of sight'' supervision. That is, \ntherapeutic foster care children must be in view of the foster parents \nat all times, except when attending school and other approved \nactivities.\n  Recruiting parents to provide therapeutic foster care is a never-\nending job. There are always children waiting for a match to be found. \nTherapeutic foster care children stay in crisis shelters for the \ntransition period, adding a great deal of stress to their lives.\n  Each State has a different standard for determining whether children \nneed therapeutic foster care. Once a child is identified, most State \ngovernments contract with private agencies to place the child in a \nhome.\n  In my State of Oklahoma, fifteen agencies contract with the State \ngovernment to provide therapeutic foster care services. Of those 15 \nagencies, 5 operate under a for-profit status, 10 operate under a \nnonprofit status. The bottom line is that 62 percent of therapeutic \nfoster care children are managed by for-profit agencies, and we must \nmaintain the availability of care for these children.\n  Therapeutic foster care agencies receive funding from Medicaid and \nTitle IV-E maintenance payments from the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Service, HHS. The 1996 Welfare Reauthorization Act \nattempted to correct a discrepancy between treatment of children \nmanaged by for-profit agencies and by nonprofit agencies via removing \nthe word ``nonprofit'' from title 42 of the United States Social \nSecurity Code. Unfortunately, the deletion was only made in one of the \nthree sections addressing this issue, thus causing therapeutic foster \ncare agencies to remain subjected to arbitrary regulation.\n  Only recently was it brought to the attention of Oklahoma's \nDepartment of Human Services that additional legal changes were needed. \nMost State governments face the same problem.\n  My bill amends the United States Code to allow all therapeutic foster \ncare agencies to receive maintenance payments from the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that any costs \nassociated with this legislation would be insignificant.\n  There are over 500,000 children in foster care today. A large number \nof these children require therapeutic care. The business model of for-\nprofit agencies should not prohibit Title IV-E maintenance cost \nreimbursement. Now is not the time to prevent highly qualified agencies \nfrom placing these children in safe homes.\n  I have long been dedicated to quality care for my constituents in \nOklahoma and across America. My bill to help alleviate the flu vaccine \nshortage, my\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nwork to expand access to life-saving cardiac defibrillators, and my \nbill to freeze the Federal medical assistance percentage for 10 years \nto ensure that States continue to receive adequate Federal funding \nhighlight this commitment.\n  I thank Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Craig, and Ms. Landrieu for cosponsoring \nthis bill.\n  Please join me in supporting this bill to assist on out States in the \nendeavor to serve these five-hundred-thousand-plus vulnerable children.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 181, H. R. 3204.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H. R. 3204) to amend title XXVII of the Public \n     Health Service Act to extend Federal funding for the \n     establishment and operation of State high risk health \n     insurance pools.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to bring to the floor an \namendment to H.R. 3204, The State High Risk Pool Funding Extension Act \nof 2005. The Senate companion, S. 288, sponsored by Senators Gregg and \nBaucus, was approved unanimously in February by the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee. A similar bill also unanimously passed \nthe full Senate in the last Congress.\n  The amendment to H. R. 3204 that I bring before us today reflects \nmuch careful and bipartisan work, not only within the Senate, but with \nthe House as well. After we pass this amendment and send it to the \nHouse, I expect our colleagues in that Chamber will approve it quickly, \nthus paving the way for a swift trip to the President's desk and into \nlaw.\n  This legislation extends and makes improvements in the Federal Health \nInsurance High Risk Pool Grant Program originally enacted in 2002 as \npart of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform Act, TAA. This grant \nprogram provides critical assistance States both for the start-up of \nnew risk pools and for the continued operation of existing ones.\n  State high risk pools are State-created nonprofit entities that \nprovide access to health insurance for persons who are not covered \nunder an employer plan or a government program, and whose medical \nprofile makes it very difficult or impossible for them to find coverage \nin the individual insurance market.\n  These individuals are often the sickest and most vulnerable among us, \nand who, without access to high risk pools would otherwise fall through \nthe cracks and be forced to bankrupt themselves onto the Medicaid \nrolls.\n  Nearly 200,000 people have purchased health insurance policies \nthrough high risk pools nationwide. In my home State of Wyoming more \nthan 650 people have comprehensive health insurance thanks to the \nWyoming Health Insurance Pool.\n  This insurance covers doctor visits, prescription drugs, home health \nvisits, rehabilitation services, mental health, physical therapy, and \nmaternity care. It is meaningful insurance coverage for people who \nwould otherwise be uninsurable.\n  Under these programs, individuals pay capped premiums for their \ncoverage, but such premiums generally cover only 50 to 60 percent of \nthe total cost of their care. The rest of the expense must be made up \nby other revenues, typically through an annual assessment of insurance \ncompanies.\n  The current Federal Risk Pool Grant Program authorized up to $40 \nmillion annually to help existing State high risk pools ease the steep \nlosses requiring subsidies that they incur in these programs each year. \nLast year alone, total combined losses in State risk pools was more \nthan $539 billion, an increase of 12 percent over the previous year.\n  The legislation before us today would increase authorization for \ngrants to existing risk pool programs from $40 million to $75 million \nper year through 2009. It would also extend through 2006 authorization \nfor $15 million annually for seed grants to States without risk pools \nthat wish to establish them. Under this program, States would be \neligible for grants of up to $1 million for the creation and initial \noperation of a risk pool.\n  It is critical that Congress act swiftly on this important bill. \nAuthorization for the current grant program expired at the end of \nfiscal year 2004, and all remaining funds will be exhausted upon the \nexpiration of fiscal year 2005. Moreover, many State legislatures are \nassessing whether or not to move ahead with risk pool programs. Passage \nof this legislation would send to the States a strong signal of \ncontinued and renewed Federal commitment to such programs.\n  In addition to extending and increasing authorization for Federal \ngrant assistance, our legislation also makes a certain targeted \nimprovements in how the Federal risk pool grants operate. For example, \nthe bill would allow States a greater degree of flexibility in how they \napply Federal grant dollars to their risk pool programs, and in the \nrequirements for qualifying for grants. In part, this greater \nflexibility is an acknowledgement that State programs do vary and that \na number of States are experimenting with new and innovative approaches \nin how they set up and administer their risk pool programs--approaches \nthat in some cases may not fit easily into the Federal grant parameters \nas they are currently drafted.\n  The legislation also makes some adjustments in the way grant funds \nare allocated, such that each State will now receive a sufficient \nincentive to establish or improve its high risk pool. At the same time, \nthe revised allocation system recognizes that some states have greater \nnumbers of uninsured than others, and provides extra assistance to \nStates that operate the largest risk pools.\n  The bill also includes a new bonus pool that can be tapped by States \nto offer lower premiums or improved benefits in connection with their \nhigh-risk pool, rather than requiring that all funds go to help defray \noperational losses. Up to one third of State's annual grant award could \nbe used for this purpose.\n  The legislation before us today is the same as that which drew \nunanimous and bipartisan support in our committee, both in this \nCongress and the last. It would extend and improve a program that has \nhelped thousands of medically vulnerable Americans maintain lifesaving \nhealth coverage and avoid potentially devastating financial ruin. It is \nan important part of this Congress's comprehensive efforts to make \nhealth care and health insurance more affordable and accessible for \neveryone.\n  I commend Senators Gregg and Baucus for their effective leadership on \nthis important legislation, and to our committee's ranking member, \nSenator Kennedy, for his hard work and commitment. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join me in giving this much needed legislation our full \nsupport.\n  Finally, credit should go as well to a number of current and past \nSenate staff, some of whom have worked for several years to bring this \nbill to fruition. We greatly appreciate the work of many, including \nDavid Bowen, David Fisher, Kim Monk, Stephen Northrup, Andrew Patzman, \nStacey Sachs, Conwell Smith, and Vince Ventimiglia.\n  I urge the Senate to give this much needed legislation the strong \nsupport it deserves.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Enzi \namendment at the desk be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\ntime and passed, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nthat any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
