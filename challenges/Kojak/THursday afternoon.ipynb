      "Mr. President, as the year ends, we face the sadness that surrounds the departure of good colleagues. I want to take a minute to express my pleasure in having the opportunity to know and work with Herb Kohl. We have served 16 years together on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate. He is one of the most accomplished and courteous members of the Senate. His powerful intellect along with his vast private sector experience have given him valuable insight into the issues of our time. We shared a strong belief in the importance of the Littoral Combat Ship and in the end were both pleased to see that program move forward. As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Kohl was a faithful member who had a remarkable ability to win the affection and respect of members. He always sought common ground rather than confrontation. It's been a real pleasure for me to get to know and to work with this remarkable, talented and good man. He has given much to the Senate. My best wishes are extended for this next chapter in his life.\n",
      "Mr. President, next week in Casper, a member of America's greatest generation will be recognized by the Casper Area Chamber of Commerce for a lifetime of service and leadership. I am honored to tell my colleagues about my friend, R. Stanley Lowe.  In 1943, Stan was in college and had been deferred from the draft because of his studies. But, at age 19, he wanted to do his part to protect our great Nation. He enlisted in the U.S. Merchant Marine. He served on five ships in the Pacific and Atlantic, each voyage lasting several months. Stan became a staff officer, in charge of personnel and payroll. He was also a chaplain and medical officer, called a pharmacist's mate and purser.  Stan served from 1943 to 1946, seeing things that would have a life long impact on him. The Merchant Marine had the highest rate of casualties of any service, dying at a rate of 1 in 26, and Stan was there to help the injured and comfort the dying.  Following his service, he returned to Wyoming to complete his law degree and then practice law in Rawlins. It was there he met the love of his life, Anne ``Pat'' Kirtland Selden Lowe, while they were skiing. She was remarkable, too. Pat was among the first female geologistsand a scholarship in her name continues to support students pursuing degrees in geology at the University of Wyoming.  Wyoming has benefited immensely from Stan's career. He served in the State House of Representatives and was elected to be the county and prosecuting attorney for Carbon County. He spent the majority of his distinguished career as general counsel for True Oil. In 1985, Stan led a delegation of American lawyers on a goodwill tour to China. The legal profession benefited from his wisdom through his service as counsel for the American Judicature Society.  While practicing law, he never forgot about his service and his fellow veterans. Stan was appointed to the Wyoming Veterans' Affairs Commission by Governor Mike Sullivan in 1991 and upon his retirement he was named chair emeritus. In 2003, Stan was awarded the Civilian Meritorious Service Medal. Stan has led the efforts to expand Wyoming's only Veterans Cemetery. His passion for history paved the ground for the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Museum.  Stan served in supportive and leadership roles in multiple veterans' organizations. Stan is a 3 year district commander of the American Legion. He was recently honored with the title of Honorary Past Department Commander, a title only given four other times in the history of the Wyoming American Legion. Stan continues to highlight veterans events and issues through his weekly article in the Casper Journal and attends almost every troop homecoming and veterans event.  Wyoming's veterans have benefitted immensely from Stan Lowe's wisdom and leadership. Stan will turn 90 this year. Wyoming continues to look to Stan as the voice for veterans. My wife, Bobbi, and I are happy to have Stan as our friend, and veterans all over Wyoming are fortunate because Stan chose to serve.\n",

      "PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n",
      "Mr. President, in the years I have served in legislative bodies, which is quite a long time now, it is interesting to see how different people approach the legislative process. I have learned over the years there is nothing more important than people working hard. You have to be tenacious to get legislation passed.  The leader of passing Sandy over hereand I am confident when we get back in a couple of weeks after the House works on theirs, the same dynamic will be herethe senior Senator from New York has worked tirelessly to get legislation passed. He has led a team effort of Senators from New Jersey and his partner, Senator Gillibrand, but the leader, the quarterback, has been the Senator from New York.  The work he has done not only in the Senate, but having the many years of experience he had in the House of Representatives, the Presiding Officer, the senior Senator from New York, worked day and night making phone calls, personal contacts with people in New York and New Jersey who could call House Members and have them pass this legislation.  On the way back from the joint session dealing with the electoral vote count, he walked up and grabbed medid not grab me, but we talked for several minutes walking back to the Senatethe majority leader from the House of Representatives. He worked extremely hard on this. He worked hard on it. I indicated to him that I had received calls from people in New York who appreciated very much his efforts to try to get this thing passed.  I really do believe it is important that I have the record reflect the reason we have gotten as far as we have on Sandy is because of the senior Senator from New York. It is too bad that it has taken so long. When we had that devastation from Katrina, we were there within days taking care of Mississippi, Alabama, and especially Louisianawithin days. We are now past 2 months with the people of New York and New Jersey.  The people of New Orleans and that area, they were hurt but nothing in comparison to what happened to the people in New York and New Jersey. Almost 1 million people have lost their homes; 1 million people lost their homes. That is homes, that is not people in those homes. So I think it is just unfortunate that we do not have the relief for New York and New Jersey and the rest already. It has to be done. We have to meet the needs of the American people when an act of God occurs.  So I, on behalf of the entire Senate, and certainly my Democratic caucus, express my appreciation to the legislative initiative and the legislative expertise of my friend from New York, an experienced legislator in the State of New York, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. He has done a masterful job.\n",
      "alone has taken out a $5 billion loan, but it will be in real financial jeopardy unless it is assured that it will be reimbursed for all the damage that Sandy caused to our railroads and our tunnels and our mass transit systemour amazing mass transit system that brings 3\\1/2\\ million people off and on Manhattan Island every single day.  What is not in this bill is help to bring the electricity system back up to snuff so there will not be major blackouts, so people can be assured of their electricity.  What is not in this bill is help for all of the communities that laid out hundreds of millions and billions of dollars for the cleanup. Their taxpayers will foot the bill unless Congress does what it has always done: step to the plate when a major disaster occurs and have the Federal Government help the locality. There has been a wisdom for 100 years that when an area is afflicted by a disaster, we unite as a nation and come together and help that part of the country whether it is New Mexico or California or Louisiana or Florida or Missouri or North Dakota or New York or New Jersey.  This bill is a first step to deal with flood insurance. It is the easiest part. The hard stuff is still ahead of us. We await the House returning in a week and a half, and we hope and expect, in fact, that they will vote the full $51 billion remainder. We hope and expect, in fact, that they will not put in legislative language that prevents money from getting to homeowners and communities that need it desperately right away.  The draft we have seen contains some major changes from the Senate bill that would make it very difficult for NIH, the Army Corps, and other parts of the government to spend the dollars that are needed efficiently and quickly and to place them where they go. We beseech the House to finish its business, to finish the major part of its business, and approve the $51 billion that will make up the rest of the $60.  We beseech them not to hamstring the local homeowners and businesses and governments with language that would prevent recovery. We beseech them to move quickly. Of course, the ideal would be for them to pass the same bill that the Senate passed in the waning hours of the last session. If they cannot, we will have to get legislation through the body again. But through the generosity of the majority leader, he has assured us it will be the first order of business when we return. So we have to move forward.  As we have seen, this is not going to be easy. There are many bumps in the road and obstacles that we cannot yet see. For sure they will arise and for sure we will have to grapple with them.  This vote needs to be the beginning of the process. It cannot certainly be the end, and it certainly cannot be the middle. We cannot just pass the $9 billion bill and then say that is it. We cannot let the House pass this and rest on its laurels. We in New York and New Jersey cannot let our guard down. Not until the full $60 billion arrives in New York and New Jersey can we stop working. So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and then alert them to keep the victims of Sandy in New York, New Jersey, and elsewhere in their thoughts so that we can continue to support the region when we return.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum. \n",

      "of New Mexico. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago Americans gathered all across the Nation to commemorate Veterans Day. It is a day that we set aside to remember, and express our gratitude to, the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces. It is a day to honor the heroes among us, and those who, sadly, have left us.  Today I wish to pay tribute to an American hero, Army SGT Clinton K. Ruiz. Sergeant Ruiz died on October 25 while on patrol in Uruzgan Province, Afghanistan, from injuries sustained from small arms fire. He was just 22 years old. He leaves behind a wife, Kira, and a baby son, Caleb.  As we face the tragedy of this brave young soldier's death, it is important too that we remember his life. Sergeant Ruiz's journey on this Earth ended far too soon, but his memory among those whose lives he touched, and in a nation's gratitude, will endure.  Clinton Ruiz was born on March 14, 1990. He graduated from Murrieta Valley High School in Murrieta, CA, and enlisted with the Army in 2009. He was assigned to A Company, 9th Military Information Support Battalion, 8th Military Information Support Group. Sergeant Ruiz was deployed to Afghanistan in September.  In the decade that our military has been fighting in Afghanistan, thousands of our fellow citizens have volunteered to serve. These courageous men and women risk their own safety to protect the safety of others. They leave their homes and their loved ones to defend the freedoms that we hold dear. Over 2,000 of these heroes have paid the ultimate price, for our freedoms, in Afghanistan.  Words cannot lessen the sorrow of the loved ones who grieve for Sergeant Ruiz now. Words cannot fully express the gratitude our Nation owes this valiant soldier. We can only remember, indeed we must never forget, the sacrifice that SGT Clinton Ruiz made in service to our country.  President Kennedy said that ``stories of past courage . . . can teach, they can offer hope, they can provide inspiration. But, they cannot supply courage itself. For this, each man must look into his own soul.'' Sergeant Clinton Ruiz had such courage. In the face of great danger, at great risk to himself, he went where his country sent him. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart. He kept the promise he had made to serve. Our Nation is forever in his debt.  Sergeant Ruiz loved his family. He loved his country. He made the ultimate sacrifice defending it. To Sergeant Ruiz's family, I offer my deepest sympathies. We honor Sergeant Ruiz's courage. We remember his sacrifice. And we mourn your loss.\n",
      "of New Mexico. Mr. President, just a few weeks ago our Nation commemorated Veterans Day. It is above all a day of remembrance and gratitude. A time to remember the courage and sacrifice of the brave men and women who have served our Nation in the Armed Forces. It is a day when we pay tribute to the heroes among us. And to those who are no longer with us.  Today I wish to honor one of those heroes. On Tuesday, October 30, our Nation lost a great American, Navajo Code Talker George Smith. Mr. Smith was born on June 15, 1922, in Mariano Lake, NM, and was Salt People Clan, born for Black Streak Wood People Clan. In 1943, he enlisted with the Marines. He was trained as a Navajo Code Talker and achieved the rank of corporal while serving in the Pacific. Corporal Smith fought in battles in Saipan, Tinian, Ryukyu Islands. He also served in Okinawa, Hawaii, and Japan. His brother, Albert Smith, also trained as a Code Talker, and served with him.  The Marines who constituted the Navajo Code Talkers were small in number, but monumental in significance. Their skills were crucial to American victory in the Pacific during World War II. They turned their language into an unbreakable code. In battle after battle, in the thick of ferocious combat, they used that code as a powerful weapon in securing Allied victory. Our Nation will never forget what George Smith, and his brother, Albert Smith, and all of their fellow Code Talkers accomplished.  Their service is all the more poignant in that they fought for freedom in a world that did not always accord freedom to them. When America entered World War II, the U.S. government had only recognized Native Americans as citizens for 17 years. In some places, tribal members still did not have the right to vote. 45,000 of the 350,000 Native Americans in the U.S. at that time served in the war. This tradition of military service by Native Americans continues to this day. Native Americans have the highest rate of service of any ethnic group.  Mr. Smith was awarded the Congressional Silver Medal. After the war, Code Talker Smith returned home and dedicated himself to his family and community. He worked at Fort Wingate in disposing of old ammunition, and then as a mechanic at Fort Wingate Trading Post. Eventually, he went to Fort Defiance, where he served as a shop foreman. He later worked as a heavy equipment mechanic in Shiprock.  Code Talker George Smith was blessed with a long life. When he passed away last month, he was 90 years old. He will be missed by his family, his friends, and his community, and he will always be remembered by a grateful nation. I extend my deepest sympathies to his family. We are forever in his debt. I hope that those who mourn him now will find comfort in all that he accomplished. His life made a difference. His invaluable service during World War II saved lives. Our Nation is free because of heroes like Code Talker George Smith.\n",
      "of New Mexico. Mr. President, in the annals of our Nation's military history, the story of the defenders of Bataan will long live in our collective memory. One of those great defenders, Mr. Virgil Wallace, recently passed away at the age of 99. Mr. Wallace survived the 4 month battle, the infamous Bataan Death March, and 3 years of horrendous captivity. He was the State of New Mexico's oldest Bataan veteran.  Our Nation is forever in debt to the extraordinary courage and sacrifice that Mr. Wallace and the ``Battling Bastards of Bataan'' demonstrated in the early days of World War II. Their heroic resistance helped slow the Japanese advance, allowing crucial time for the Allied forces to reorganize and eventually reverse Japan's progress. They played a crucial role in our Nation's history. I am proud to have sponsored legislation to award these valiant soldiers the Congressional Gold Medal.  The Japanese attack on the Philippines in December, 1941, just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, led to 4 months of intense combat. Outnumbered, outgunned, Mr. Wallace and his fellow soldiers put up a desperate fight. For 4 months, they struggled, they valiantly fought, against impossible odds, and without hope of resupply, until they finally surrendered.  Their suffering was only just beginning. The brutal Bataan Death March was followed by terrible conditions in Japanese prisons and work camps. Starvation. Torture. Forced work. And, for so many of these brave men, death. By the time they were rescued, toward the end of the war, half of New Mexico's 1,800 soldiers serving in Bataan had died. Another 300 would die from complications related to their captivity within a year of returning to the U.S. Mr. Wallace was held captive for more than 3 horrific years.  Virgil Wallace was awarded the Bronze Star and numerous other commendations for his heroic service. After the war, he returned to New Mexico, where he worked for the Department of Transportation and later Carrie Tingley Hospital in Truth or Consequences.  Our Nation will long remember this courageous soldier, a man who gave so much in service to his country. Mr. Wallace is one of the last of a legendary band of brothers, who represented the very best of who we are. In the dark days of the beginning of World War II, they showed America's fighting spirit and inspired a nation.  I extend my deepest sympathies to Mr. Wallace's family and friends. I hope that you will find comfort in your memories of his long, and distinguished, life. We honor his valor and his example, and we mourn your loss.\n",

      "OFFICER (Mr. Schatz). The Republican leader is recognized.\n",
      "Mr. President, I wish to start by congratulating President Obama on his inauguration. Presidential inaugurations are always a time for the country to come together. We all feel a certain pride in the event, and we are reminded of how fortunate we are to live in a Nation where we have the ability to choose our leaders freely and resolve our differences in peace. Inauguration Day is also a time for new beginnings, a chance to learn from the mistakes and missed opportunities of the past as we reengage in some vitally important debates about our future.  Too often over the past 4 years, political considerations have trumped the need to put our country on a sound financial footing and a path to prosperity. Today we should recommit ourselves to the task of facing up to our problems headon. I understand that the passions of an election can sometimes overshadow the business of governing, but the Presidential campaign is now behind us, and so it is my hope that the President will finally be willing to do what Republicans have been asking him to do since his first inauguration 4 years ago, and that is to work with us on identifying durable solutions to the problems we can only solve together, to put aside those things we know we can't agree on and focus on what we can.  We should start with spending and debt because if we don't get a handle on that, nothing else matters. If we don't work together to strengthen our entitlement programs, they will go bankrupt. Automatic cuts will be forced on seniors already receiving benefits, rendering worthless the promises they have built their retirements around. It is nice to say, as the President did yesterday, that these programs free us to take the risks that make our country great, but if we don't act to strengthen and protect them now, in a few years they simply won't be there in their current form. And if we don't work together to control the debt, then the cost of our interest payments alone will eventually crowd out funding for things we all agree onfrom defense, to infrastructure, and assistance for those who need it most. In short, the debate we are now engaged in over the growing Federal debt is about much more than numbers on a page; it is about the cost of inaction in terms of promises broken, jobs lost, and dreams deferred. That is why there is simply no more time to waste.  Over the past 4 years, while the President focused on reelection and too many Senate Democrats focused on avoiding tough decisions, the debt grew by more than $6 trillion. We saw the President blast House Republicans for doing their job and passing a budget while Senate Democrats didn't even propose one. Rather than work with us to save existing entitlements, we saw the President team up with Democrats in Congress to force through a brandnew entitlement that will make it even harder to cover the cost of programs we already have. In short, Democrats have put off the hard stuff until now, and our problems have only gotten worse.  But that was the first term. A second term presents the opportunity to do things differently, and in the Senate that means a return to regular order. Later this week the House plans to send the Senate a bill to address the debt limit in a timely manner. Once we get it, the Senate should quickly respond. If the Senate version is different from the one the House sends over, send it to conference. That is how things are supposed to work around here. We used to call it legislating.  I know a lot of Democrats are afraid of a process that exposes their priorities, particularly on spending and debt. After nearly 4 years of refusing to pass a budget, they have only now reluctantly agreed to develop a spending plan for the coming fiscal year. All I would say to that is since the revenue question has been settled, I am sure the American people are eager to see what other ideas Democrats might have to bring down our ruinous deficits.  Let me just say that one thing Americans will no longer tolerate is an attitude that says we can put off our work until the very last minute. They are tired of eleventhhour deals. They are tired of careening from crisis to crisis, and so am I.  The good news is that a return to regular order is the surest way to solve the problems we face. And I hope some of my friends on the other side will agree that there is value in this body actually functioning the way it was intended to. Let's face it. The status quo isn't working. The Senate isn't functioning as it should. It has nothing to do with the process that has served us well for a very long time. But if we work together and strive to avoid some of the bad habits that have developed around here, I truly believe we will be able to achieve the kinds of solutions that have eluded us for the past 4 years and deliver some positive results for the people who sent us here, with time to spare.  We can do better. I know my constituents expect better than what they have been getting from Congress in recent years, and so should we.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n",

      "of Colorado. In looking at this, I do not see anything in the proposals, and I think we, in working on this together, tried to bring a discipline to it that said we want to preserve the best traditions of the Senate, we want the minority to be heard, we want the minority to have amendments, and we want them included in the process. What we don't want is the tyranny of the minority. And the Founders talked about the tyranny of the minority. They talked about the fact that if you allowed a small minority to govern and block the governing of the majority, that was the tyranny of the minority, and they feared that.  So I think that when we consider this and we talk about the filibuster and our institution today, our Senate, where many times the Republican leader has come to the floor and said that it is going to take 60 votes, everything takes 60 votes, that isn't the way the Founders designed it. The Founders actually had very strong language for what they thought of supermajorities.  Everybody remembers their history. The Founders came off the Articles of Confederation. It was a supermajority. It didn't work. It was broken. So they only put into the Constitution in five places supermajoritiesthings such as expelling a Member and ratifying a treatybut otherwise it was simple majorities. And when the history is going to be written, it is hard to tell how this happened. But to have a leader of the Senate stand and say that everything takes 60 votesthe Founders never contemplated that. When they adopted rule XXII in 1917, that wasn't what they were trying to do, and the rule has actually been turned on its head.  Madam President, I yield the floor. \n",
      "OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon. \n",
      "Madam President, I would like to follow up on the last point Senator Udall of New Mexico made about our Founders.  I have in my hand three of the Federalist Papers, Federalist Papers 22, 75, and 58. These are by Madison and Hamilton, and they explore this issue of the supermajority. It was a very conscious decision that a supermajority was not put into the Constitution for decisions of these Chambers. And the reason whyand they explained it more eloquentlyis essentially that if you take the path that the minority thinks is the right path rather than the path the majority thinks is the right path, then over time you make a series of worse decisions. The minority might be right on occasion, but most of the time the viewpoint brought by those representing the greatest number of States in this case or the greatest number of citizens on the House side is the path that makes sense. And they warned about the supermajority as an instrument that would bring paralysis. It is almost as if they could look forward 200 years to this moment and say: Don't do that because you will end up with paralysis.  This is from Federalist Paper No. 22 by Alexander Hamilton. He wrote this in 1787, and he notes in commenting about the issue of a simple majority that ``there is commonly a necessity for action. The public business must, in some way or other, go forward. If a pertinacious minority can control the opinion of a majority, respecting the best mode of conducting it, the majority, in order that something may be done, must conform to the views of the minority; and thus the sense of the smaller number will overrule that of the greater, and give a tone to the national proceedings. Hence, tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.''  Let me read that last set of words about what Hamilton said would happen if you had a supermajority requirement in the Senate: ``tedious delays; continual negotiation and intrigue; contemptible compromises of the public good.'' I think anyone watching the proceedings of the Senate for the last 2 years would say that Hamilton was right on the mark in that regard. And, of course, he was not alone. There was not a single Federalist Paper written arguing that there should be a supermajority in the Senate or the House because of the experience that had been had previous to forming the strategy embodied in the Constitution.  Let's turn to James Madison. In Federalist 58, James Madison said:       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have      been required for a quorum . . .  He goes on to discuss it in various views, and he said:       Lastly, it would facilitate and foster the baneful practice      of secessions; a practice which has shown itself even in      States where a majority only is required; a practice      subversive  And here is the key language       a practice subversive of all the principles of order and      regular government; a practice which leads more directly to      public convulsions, and the ruin of popular governments, than      any other which has yet been displayed among us.  He also made the point that we would end up with equitable sacrifices to the general wealor general good.  So as we turn to our conversations in our respective caucuses and to the dialog here on the floor of the Senate, I ask my colleagues to search your hearts about our responsibility to the citizens of the United States of America to address the big issues facing America, which means that we don't paralyze this body in secret. If my colleagues have points to make, then make them as was done during the periods of great debate on the floor of the Senate: Make them on the floor of the Senate, engage in that debate, and when no more is to be said, when all 100 Senators say: We have had our full input, then let's make a decision.  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n",

      "Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in remembering our friend and colleague Senator Daniel Inouye. Dan Inouye dedicated his life to Hawaii and represented Hawaii from when it achieved statehood until his death.  Senator Inouye was respected and loved by members of both parties and both chambers. He was the last Senator to serve with both Everett Dirksen and Richard Russell. Senator Inouye learned early the importance of doing something for the good of the Nation and the good of the Senate, as well as the importance of personal relationships and trust among colleagues. For Dan Inouye, his word was his bond and that applied to Democrats and Republicans alike. He became the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senate President ProTempore, was the second longest serving Senator in history and served on special committees investigating the Watergate and Iran Contra scandals. At the time of his death, he had long become a Senate giant in his own right.  Long before reaching the Senate, Dan Inouye was an American hero. Enlisting in the Army after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he served in Europe earning a Bronze Star, Purple Heart and Distinguished Service Cross for helping his fellow soldiers while suffering terrible injuries. Later in life, President Clinton would confer upon him the Medal of Honor.  His moral character and life experiences made Senator Inouye a leader on many of the pressing issues of the day from civil rights to veterans benefits and from health care to helping people with disabilities. Through his position on the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye was able to direct funding to important projects and research that helped bring about important advancements as well as simply help people.  Dan Inouye was also a strong supporter of Israel and the Jewish community. From his advocacy on behalf of Holocaust survivors, to his efforts to help free Jews from the former Soviet Union to his influential role in securing funding for Israel, Senator Inouye was a tireless friend and advocate. He was given the nickname ``Trumpeldor'' after a Zionist hero, Joseph Trumpeldor.  In closing, I am reminded of a quote used to eulogize Daniel Webster that President Nixon used when eulogizing Everett Dirksen, ``Our great men are the common property of the country.'' Senator Inouye was indeed a great man and our country is better off today for his commitment, his conscience and his years of dedicated service.\n",
